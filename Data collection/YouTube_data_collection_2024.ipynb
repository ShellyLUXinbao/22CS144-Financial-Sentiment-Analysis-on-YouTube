such as Nvidia and Microsoft to new heights so our major investing exchanges cashing in on all this excitement Vlad ten of Robin Hood co-founder and CEO joins me now Vlad always nice to get some time with you I know you do a lot of these interviews especially a couple weeks after earnings but I'm like I have to connect with Vlad because your stock is ring the broader Market is rallying on your platform what have you know these record setting markets done to that platform and what are you seeing among people typically when the crypto markets see uh a lot of excitement we benefit from that you know we're one of the largest crypto platforms um in in the US um we've been growing market share and that's continued uh through 2023 I think last time I was on your show we were talking a little bit about that but um it's definitely not just crypto uh We've we've seen increased levels of activity with the markets across all of our assets and products so people have been uh entering the equity markets uh options trading has been up through 2023 as well uh equity's market share went up about 14% options Market share at Robin Hood was closer to 20 at about 19% so as we've been improving our products we stand to benefit when there's heightened Market interest have you seen the rally AI stocks crypto whatever it is is this pulling in the next generation of investors I think you're you're seeing a couple of things certainly there's heightened retail interest and you're seeing investment apps uh getting uh getting more downloads you can look at kind of the public App Store rankings and there has been a Resurgence in interest in investing certainly we've benefited from that um but what's really interesting is um it's not just uh it's not just the markets and it's not just individual AI stocks and crypto um you look at our retirement business more and more people are interested in retirement as well so we announced that we had 1.7 billion in assets under custody in retirement Accounts at the end of last year and recently our CFO was at a conference he said that number had close to doubled at over three billion just in a couple of months so um there's general interest in long-term investing as well and we're excited to be serving that market are investors still looking at Robin Hood as as a trading platform platform because I've been following a lot of the work that you and your team have done really over the past 12 months a lot more Innovation 24hour trading a push into retirement products do you ultimately want to be that One-Stop destination for you know that maybe perhaps replaces going down to your local bank branch and using it for whatever you want to use it for there's three things that we're focused on right now number one uh we want to be number one in the active Trader market so active Traders are very important for us uh they care about very specific things like performance pricing user experience and we're making lots of Investments there both in the user experience and in new product innovations that other competitors don't offer 24-hour market being a great example there but we don't want to just serve active Traders and so we want to grow wallet chare with our customers we want to help them build wealth and that's the second priority prity that's where Robin Hood gold and our high yield products come in that's where retirement comes in and of course the credit card where we're entering a new product category that's very important to customers then the third area of focus is expanding internationally I think the last time I was at your show we were uh we had just announced the UK launch and we had also launched in the EU and we see a huge opportunity there are hundreds of millions of consumers that are underserved and that's sort of our beach head to the rest of the world what is the size of that credit card business how big could that be 12 months after launch and where exactly are you with that product one of the reasons we're so interested in the credit card Market is it's so big right um over 80% of us adults have a credit card at least one um there's hundreds of millions of credit cards in circulation um in the us alone and if you look at the credit card Market in general we see three things number one it's large number two the incumbents are enjoying very large margins so the The Profit pools in that business are very large and the third is it hasn't really been digitized yet so the experience of a credit card I mean sans's Apple pay is pretty much the same as it was 20 years ago um and when we see those three things we see a great opportunity for us to enter the market and and disrupt so um it's it's getting close the team's been working hard I've seen the designs and we'll be uh we'll be looking forward to unveiling it shortly V just before you came on we had the um opportunity to talk to SEC chair Gary guner and towards the end of the conversation they were talking a lot about crypto and the moves in crypto uh the chair noting uh that the sector is Rife with abuses and frauds and at some point you maybe the investment public is putting their own Investments at risk I mean bigger picture I what do you think about this move in crypto and and do you think investors truly understand what they're getting in the crypto space right now uh I think if I had to look at this move um it it's you know we we see uh a supply and demand imbalance starting with Bitcoin right so all these new ET FS came into the market they've been Gathering assets were now able to more easily plug institutional interest of which there's a lot in uh in crypto and they've been they've been generating more demand you also have the the Bitcoin having where there's less Supply coming in and I think the market anticipates that I do think um the crypto space is quite broad it it refers to a lot of things now in including you know just coins that a couple of software Engineers overseas can launch on an exchange and I think with that level of decentralization and sort of uh um access are risks but then you look on the other side of the spectrum and there's significant institutional interest in adding Bitcoin and and other cryptocurrencies into customers portfol folios uh more and more large institutions and endowments are starting to look at it um governments you've seen uh start to look at it too um like El Salvador for instance but think we anticipate that might not be the end of that um and and so I think that's very much entered the the mainstream as a as an asset that customers need and and look uh look to add in their portfolios vad you've been uh leading this company really through two like a a series of big moments for investors of course a couple years ago at the the mem stock frenzy but right now markets at all-time highs crypto all-time highs what lessons are you putting to play today leadership operationally whatever it might be things that you learned a couple years ago what are you putting into play now yeah I mean I uh a couple years ago felt like a different world you know it felt like we we didn't really have to um operate particularly well as a company to do what well in in covid times the tide sort of lifted all boats now uh starting in 2022 with the increase in interest rates you know it's sort of washed out a lot of uh a lot of the excess in the markets and we've had to operate differently so just emphasizing efficiency performance focusing on the things that are incredibly important making sure that the team is aligned and and we've got the top talent I think these are all things that the management team and myself have learned over the past couple of years and now when we see a little bit of a recovery and you know if interest rates then start dropping as many are predicting we should see that turn into a a Tailwind for the business in a in a big way it's always uh great to get a few minutes with you uh thank you always for making time for Yahoo finance Vlad ten of Robinhood co-founder and Co have a good weekend we'll talk to you soon thanks Brian \",\n          \"well recent home buyers affected by higher interest rates may be surprised to find out that a lucrative tax benefit taken on itemized returns is back in the picture here to explain more is Yahoo finances Rebecca Chen Rebecca what are we talking about hey Aiko so on the show we've talked plenty about how high mortgage interest rate has been hurting home buyers but today we really want to highlight how high morgage interest rate in a rare Silver Lining can actually help home buyers and essentially it is is known as mortgage interest deduction on your itemization know or otherwise known as the schedule a so essentially you just taxpayers they can deduct the amount they pay for mortgage interest on this itemization um and as you can and if we really talk about how much over here it um it's really quite a chunk if let's say if you recently purchase a home and then you have a loan for about $500,000 you can get a pretty big you can get a pretty good size interest uh interest deduction which is around the price about 36,000 and that just is way more than the standard deduction that most people have right now and this really isn't um something that has been under radar for many home buyers because for the past couple of years rates has been so low that nobody really took advantage of this and you really can't because it made more sense to go with the standard deduction but given that today the combination of high home prices and high interest rate this is definitely coming back into picture Rebecca the medium us home price is around $400,000 how many new home buyers can actually take this benefit so Norm that's a great question because normally when we think about itemization you really think about a very few Americans who can take advantage of that um but given today's just basically high home prices you can see all the new home buyers even the ones who uh the ones who purchase a medium pric home or once below you're getting almost $23,000 of mortgage interest deduction that you can take on your tax return and even if the home prices you uh you have is a little bit lower than that you can tack on other things like charitable deduction your property taxes your state income local taxes and even medical expenses to really push up that deduction so again when we're comparing this to standard deduction if you're recently a new home buyer and you lock into one of the higher rates whether it be 6% 7 % or 8% even 8% you're really getting that benefit that you can take advantage of so a lot of experts I've spoken with said right now if you're paying this uh your mortgage payment monthly mortgage payment and it's pretty steep just think about how the principle is going towards your Equity but your uh interest that you're paying is going towards this uh tax benefit so definitely um what we're seeing is for people to take advantage of this because this ad AG it's back in the picture it's on the table so if you are in a position to can take that deduction definitely go for it \",\n          \"Today, we're looking at how the high\\ncost of borrowing is impacting how Americans feel about the economy.\\nBloomberg's David Westin sat down with Judd Cramer, a Harvard lecturer who\\npenned an article with Larry Summers about the trends.\\nDavid asked him why consumers aren't buying the story of a strong economy\\ndespite some of the data. Traditionally, economists have been able\\nto look at GDP growth, inflation and unemployment, and from that really get a\\ngood measure of where consumers will have been.\\nBut this time around, something seems to have broken.\\nAnd so that's what led us to really try to dig in to the inflation measures and\\nsee what might have been different now versus how we were measuring things in\\nthe 1970s. So how is it different now than the way\\nwe were measuring in the 1970s? Yeah.\\nSo before 1983, housing prices and crucially for our research, mortgage\\nrates were included in the CPI. So when we saw mortgage rates jump last\\nyear from 3% to 7%, if we had been measuring inflation the way we did in\\nthe 1970s, instead of seeing inflation peak around 10% last year, we would have\\nseen it jump all the way to 18%. So when we take that new that old\\nmethodology and apply it to current data, it kind of makes more sense to us\\nwhy consumers are still in the dumps. Not only did prices rise, but after that\\ninterest rates rose so much. And that's something that has really\\nbeen weighing on their finances. For those was old of remember, there was\\nsomething called the misery index that I guess came actually from Arthur\\nOkun. And I'm not sure I knew that before I\\nread your paper. \\nBut why did we move away from that misery index?\\nWhy did we take out some of those borrowing costs that affect consumers?\\nYeah. What's interesting is Arthur Okun and\\nthe misery index was so pivotal in explaining the way people were feeling\\nabout Jimmy Carter that we sort of kept using it going forward.\\nAnd folks are still looking at CPI, inflation and the unemployment rate.\\nBut what they don't necessarily realize is that the way we've measured inflation\\nhas really changed. So what we did is we reconstructed the\\noriginal misery index from Arthur Okun, and what we show in the paper is\\nactually that's much more powerful than the simplified Okun and misery index\\nthat we look at today. And if we use the old measure, we can\\nactually explain about 70% of the so-called vibe session that we are\\ncurrently experiencing in the United States.\\nAnd from your paper, I take it that you basically use as a consumer sentiment\\nindicator, the University of Michigan, my old alma mater, University of\\nMichigan Consumer Sentiment Index. Does that track with your new inflation\\nindex? We think that the Michigan sentiment is\\nthe best measure, and that is what people have been citing because it's\\nreally been lagging other economic indicators.\\nBut as we say, when we sort of broaden the scope a little bit on some of those\\nindicators, it does a much better job of explaining what's going on in the\\nUniversity of Michigan index. We haven't explained all of it.\\nThere's certainly some room for partisanship or inequality or some other\\nAmerican specific factors. But we do think that thinking about\\nborrowing costs and the cost of money that everyday Americans are paying goes\\na long way to experience, to explaining why they feel the way they do about this\\neconomy. So so a big issue in financial markets\\nright now is what is the Fed going to do with interest rates?\\nWhen are they going to cut? How much are they going to cut or even\\nsome people even suggest they might conceivably raise?\\nAnd take your analysis. Let's assume the Fed decided today we're\\ngoing to use your measurement of inflation.\\nHow might it affect monetary policy? Certainly, there would have been no\\nimpetus for the idea of rate cuts starting at the end of last year.\\nBy our own measure, inflation would still be 8% in November of last year.\\nSo certainly they would not have been thinking about\\nusing the rate policy to try to stimulate the economy so the inflation\\nrate would be higher under your measurement than what we're seeing right\\nnow. On the other hand, part of the inflation\\non your measurement would include the cost of borrowing with which the Fed\\neffects. I mean, if its job is price stability\\nand one of the prices is actually the price of borrowing money, they could\\nactually bring down, if you will, your inflation measurement by cutting rates.\\nCould they not? Yes.\\nSo partially and that's one thing that we we looked at when we went back to the\\nVolcker era. We actually think that by Volcker\\nraising rates a lot at the beginning, he made the inflation that he eventually\\nslayed look a lot harder than it actually was.\\nAnd that's why the two things were more comparable.\\nBut yeah, you could get into this circular issue where the cost of money\\nis part of the cost of living. So if we raise interest rates, we're\\nraising the cost of living. But actually that's the antithesis of\\nwhat we're trying to do. So that's one of the other reasons why I\\nthink sort of punting on the issue of the cost of money and excluding it from\\nthe CPI is is where we landed. But yes, it's a very interesting\\nargument because when you ask people on the street, they certainly consider the\\ncost of borrowing, the cost of their credit card debt, the cost of car\\nfinancing or the cost of mortgage part of their consumption basket.\\nBut putting that in the measure that the Fed targeted could get us in in an odd\\ndirections. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

such as Nvidia and Microsoft to new heights so our major investing exchanges cashing in on all this excitement Vlad ten of Robin Hood co-founder and CEO joins me now Vlad always nice to get some time with you I know you do a lot of these interviews especially a couple weeks after earnings but I'm like I have to connect with Vlad because your stock is ring the broader Market is rallying on your platform what have you know these record setting markets done to that platform and what are you seeing among people typically when the crypto markets see uh a lot of excitement we benefit from that you know we're one of the largest crypto platforms um in in the US um we've been growing market share and that's continued uh through 2023 I think last time I was on your show we were talking a little bit about that but um it's definitely not just crypto uh We've we've seen increased levels of activity with the markets across all of our assets and products so people have been uh entering the equity markets uh options trading has been up through 2023 as well uh equity's market share went up about 14% options Market share at Robin Hood was closer to 20 at about 19% so as we've been improving our products we stand to benefit when there's heightened Market interest have you seen the rally AI stocks crypto whatever it is is this pulling in the next generation of investors I think you're you're seeing a couple of things certainly there's heightened retail interest and you're seeing investment apps uh getting uh getting more downloads you can look at kind of the public App Store rankings and there has been a Resurgence in interest in investing certainly we've benefited from that um but what's really interesting is um it's not just uh it's not just the markets and it's not just individual AI stocks and crypto um you look at our retirement business more and more people are interested in retirement as well so we announced that we had 1.7 billion in assets under custody in retirement Accounts at the end of last year and recently our CFO was at a conference he said that number had close to doubled at over three billion just in a couple of months so um there's general interest in long-term investing as well and we're excited to be serving that market are investors still looking at Robin Hood as as a trading platform platform because I've been following a lot of the work that you and your team have done really over the past 12 months a lot more Innovation 24hour trading a push into retirement products do you ultimately want to be that One-Stop destination for you know that maybe perhaps replaces going down to your local bank branch and using it for whatever you want to use it for there's three things that we're focused on right now number one uh we want to be number one in the active Trader market so active Traders are very important for us uh they care about very specific things like performance pricing user experience and we're making lots of Investments there both in the user experience and in new product innovations that other competitors don't offer 24-hour market being a great example there but we don't want to just serve active Traders and so we want to grow wallet chare with our customers we want to help them build wealth and that's the second priority prity that's where Robin Hood gold and our high yield products come in that's where retirement comes in and of course the credit card where we're entering a new product category that's very important to customers then the third area of focus is expanding internationally I think the last time I was at your show we were uh we had just announced the UK launch and we had also launched in the EU and we see a huge opportunity there are hundreds of millions of consumers that are underserved and that's sort of our beach head to the rest of the world what is the size of that credit card business how big could that be 12 months after launch and where exactly are you with that product one of the reasons we're so interested in the credit card Market is it's so big right um over 80% of us adults have a credit card at least one um there's hundreds of millions of credit cards in circulation um in the us alone and if you look at the credit card Market in general we see three things number one it's large number two the incumbents are enjoying very large margins so the The Profit pools in that business are very large and the third is it hasn't really been digitized yet so the experience of a credit card I mean sans's Apple pay is pretty much the same as it was 20 years ago um and when we see those three things we see a great opportunity for us to enter the market and and disrupt so um it's it's getting close the team's been working hard I've seen the designs and we'll be uh we'll be looking forward to unveiling it shortly V just before you came on we had the um opportunity to talk to SEC chair Gary guner and towards the end of the conversation they were talking a lot about crypto and the moves in crypto uh the chair noting uh that the sector is Rife with abuses and frauds and at some point you maybe the investment public is putting their own Investments at risk I mean bigger picture I what do you think about this move in crypto and and do you think investors truly understand what they're getting in the crypto space right now uh I think if I had to look at this move um it it's you know we we see uh a supply and demand imbalance starting with Bitcoin right so all these new ET FS came into the market they've been Gathering assets were now able to more easily plug institutional interest of which there's a lot in uh in crypto and they've been they've been generating more demand you also have the the Bitcoin having where there's less Supply coming in and I think the market anticipates that I do think um the crypto space is quite broad it it refers to a lot of things now in including you know just coins that a couple of software Engineers overseas can launch on an exchange and I think with that level of decentralization and sort of uh um access are risks but then you look on the other side of the spectrum and there's significant institutional interest in adding Bitcoin and and other cryptocurrencies into customers portfol folios uh more and more large institutions and endowments are starting to look at it um governments you've seen uh start to look at it too um like El Salvador for instance but think we anticipate that might not be the end of that um and and so I think that's very much entered the the mainstream as a as an asset that customers need and and look uh look to add in their portfolios vad you've been uh leading this company really through two like a a series of big moments for investors of course a couple years ago at the the mem stock frenzy but right now markets at all-time highs crypto all-time highs what lessons are you putting to play today leadership operationally whatever it might be things that you learned a couple years ago what are you putting into play now yeah I mean I uh a couple years ago felt like a different world you know it felt like we we didn't really have to um operate particularly well as a company to do what well in in covid times the tide sort of lifted all boats now uh starting in 2022 with the increase in interest rates you know it's sort of washed out a lot of uh a lot of the excess in the markets and we've had to operate differently so just emphasizing efficiency performance focusing on the things that are incredibly important making sure that the team is aligned and and we've got the top talent I think these are all things that the management team and myself have learned over the past couple of years and now when we see a little bit of a recovery and you know if interest rates then start dropping as many are predicting we should see that turn into a a Tailwind for the business in a in a big way it's always uh great to get a few minutes with you uh thank you always for making time for Yahoo finance Vlad ten of Robinhood co-founder and Co have a good weekend we'll talk to you soon thanks Brian \",\n          \"well recent home buyers affected by higher interest rates may be surprised to find out that a lucrative tax benefit taken on itemized returns is back in the picture here to explain more is Yahoo finances Rebecca Chen Rebecca what are we talking about hey Aiko so on the show we've talked plenty about how high mortgage interest rate has been hurting home buyers but today we really want to highlight how high morgage interest rate in a rare Silver Lining can actually help home buyers and essentially it is is known as mortgage interest deduction on your itemization know or otherwise known as the schedule a so essentially you just taxpayers they can deduct the amount they pay for mortgage interest on this itemization um and as you can and if we really talk about how much over here it um it's really quite a chunk if let's say if you recently purchase a home and then you have a loan for about $500,000 you can get a pretty big you can get a pretty good size interest uh interest deduction which is around the price about 36,000 and that just is way more than the standard deduction that most people have right now and this really isn't um something that has been under radar for many home buyers because for the past couple of years rates has been so low that nobody really took advantage of this and you really can't because it made more sense to go with the standard deduction but given that today the combination of high home prices and high interest rate this is definitely coming back into picture Rebecca the medium us home price is around $400,000 how many new home buyers can actually take this benefit so Norm that's a great question because normally when we think about itemization you really think about a very few Americans who can take advantage of that um but given today's just basically high home prices you can see all the new home buyers even the ones who uh the ones who purchase a medium pric home or once below you're getting almost $23,000 of mortgage interest deduction that you can take on your tax return and even if the home prices you uh you have is a little bit lower than that you can tack on other things like charitable deduction your property taxes your state income local taxes and even medical expenses to really push up that deduction so again when we're comparing this to standard deduction if you're recently a new home buyer and you lock into one of the higher rates whether it be 6% 7 % or 8% even 8% you're really getting that benefit that you can take advantage of so a lot of experts I've spoken with said right now if you're paying this uh your mortgage payment monthly mortgage payment and it's pretty steep just think about how the principle is going towards your Equity but your uh interest that you're paying is going towards this uh tax benefit so definitely um what we're seeing is for people to take advantage of this because this ad AG it's back in the picture it's on the table so if you are in a position to can take that deduction definitely go for it \",\n          \"Today, we're looking at how the high\\ncost of borrowing is impacting how Americans feel about the economy.\\nBloomberg's David Westin sat down with Judd Cramer, a Harvard lecturer who\\npenned an article with Larry Summers about the trends.\\nDavid asked him why consumers aren't buying the story of a strong economy\\ndespite some of the data. Traditionally, economists have been able\\nto look at GDP growth, inflation and unemployment, and from that really get a\\ngood measure of where consumers will have been.\\nBut this time around, something seems to have broken.\\nAnd so that's what led us to really try to dig in to the inflation measures and\\nsee what might have been different now versus how we were measuring things in\\nthe 1970s. So how is it different now than the way\\nwe were measuring in the 1970s? Yeah.\\nSo before 1983, housing prices and crucially for our research, mortgage\\nrates were included in the CPI. So when we saw mortgage rates jump last\\nyear from 3% to 7%, if we had been measuring inflation the way we did in\\nthe 1970s, instead of seeing inflation peak around 10% last year, we would have\\nseen it jump all the way to 18%. So when we take that new that old\\nmethodology and apply it to current data, it kind of makes more sense to us\\nwhy consumers are still in the dumps. Not only did prices rise, but after that\\ninterest rates rose so much. And that's something that has really\\nbeen weighing on their finances. For those was old of remember, there was\\nsomething called the misery index that I guess came actually from Arthur\\nOkun. And I'm not sure I knew that before I\\nread your paper. \\nBut why did we move away from that misery index?\\nWhy did we take out some of those borrowing costs that affect consumers?\\nYeah. What's interesting is Arthur Okun and\\nthe misery index was so pivotal in explaining the way people were feeling\\nabout Jimmy Carter that we sort of kept using it going forward.\\nAnd folks are still looking at CPI, inflation and the unemployment rate.\\nBut what they don't necessarily realize is that the way we've measured inflation\\nhas really changed. So what we did is we reconstructed the\\noriginal misery index from Arthur Okun, and what we show in the paper is\\nactually that's much more powerful than the simplified Okun and misery index\\nthat we look at today. And if we use the old measure, we can\\nactually explain about 70% of the so-called vibe session that we are\\ncurrently experiencing in the United States.\\nAnd from your paper, I take it that you basically use as a consumer sentiment\\nindicator, the University of Michigan, my old alma mater, University of\\nMichigan Consumer Sentiment Index. Does that track with your new inflation\\nindex? We think that the Michigan sentiment is\\nthe best measure, and that is what people have been citing because it's\\nreally been lagging other economic indicators.\\nBut as we say, when we sort of broaden the scope a little bit on some of those\\nindicators, it does a much better job of explaining what's going on in the\\nUniversity of Michigan index. We haven't explained all of it.\\nThere's certainly some room for partisanship or inequality or some other\\nAmerican specific factors. But we do think that thinking about\\nborrowing costs and the cost of money that everyday Americans are paying goes\\na long way to experience, to explaining why they feel the way they do about this\\neconomy. So so a big issue in financial markets\\nright now is what is the Fed going to do with interest rates?\\nWhen are they going to cut? How much are they going to cut or even\\nsome people even suggest they might conceivably raise?\\nAnd take your analysis. Let's assume the Fed decided today we're\\ngoing to use your measurement of inflation.\\nHow might it affect monetary policy? Certainly, there would have been no\\nimpetus for the idea of rate cuts starting at the end of last year.\\nBy our own measure, inflation would still be 8% in November of last year.\\nSo certainly they would not have been thinking about\\nusing the rate policy to try to stimulate the economy so the inflation\\nrate would be higher under your measurement than what we're seeing right\\nnow. On the other hand, part of the inflation\\non your measurement would include the cost of borrowing with which the Fed\\neffects. I mean, if its job is price stability\\nand one of the prices is actually the price of borrowing money, they could\\nactually bring down, if you will, your inflation measurement by cutting rates.\\nCould they not? Yes.\\nSo partially and that's one thing that we we looked at when we went back to the\\nVolcker era. We actually think that by Volcker\\nraising rates a lot at the beginning, he made the inflation that he eventually\\nslayed look a lot harder than it actually was.\\nAnd that's why the two things were more comparable.\\nBut yeah, you could get into this circular issue where the cost of money\\nis part of the cost of living. So if we raise interest rates, we're\\nraising the cost of living. But actually that's the antithesis of\\nwhat we're trying to do. So that's one of the other reasons why I\\nthink sort of punting on the issue of the cost of money and excluding it from\\nthe CPI is is where we landed. But yes, it's a very interesting\\nargument because when you ask people on the street, they certainly consider the\\ncost of borrowing, the cost of their credit card debt, the cost of car\\nfinancing or the cost of mortgage part of their consumption basket.\\nBut putting that in the measure that the Fed targeted could get us in in an odd\\ndirections. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Stock_indices\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
