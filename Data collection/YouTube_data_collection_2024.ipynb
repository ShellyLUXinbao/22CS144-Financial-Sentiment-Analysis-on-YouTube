WHAT ABOUT IT NOW? >> WAY BACK IN JANUARY OF 2024 WHEN I SAID THIS WAS A GOOD  CONTRARIAN PICK, WE THOUGHT THE  USED CAR BUSINESS WOULD START TO IMPROVE AND CAR MAX AND THE  GENERAL CAR MARKET HAS BEEN  STRUGGLING BECAUSE INTEREST  RATES HAVE BEEN GOING UP BUT THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH INVENTORY. NO ONE WAS BUYING NEW CARS SO  THEY WEREN'T SELLING THEIR FORMER CARS TO ENTER THE USED  CAR INVENTORY MARKET THERE'S NOR SUPPLY, INTEREST RATES HAVE STOPPED GOING UP. CONSUMERS ARE SPENDING MORE  MONEY ON CARS, AND CARMAX DOES HAVE THE BEST ONLINE PRESENCE.

IF YOU LOOK AT WHERE WE ARE  PREHALVING, THAT'S GOING TO  HAPPEN IN APRIL WHERE BITCOIN'S  REWARD FOR MINERS DROPS BY HALF  F WE LOOK AT WHERE WE ARE VERSUS THE LAST ONE, I'D SAY -- WHICH  HAPPENED FOUR YEARS AGO, WE'RE  IN BETTER SHAPE. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE ETFs BACK  THEN. IF YOU LOOK AT THINGS LIKE TEE  RISKTIVE VOLUME, IT WAS NASCENT  FOUR YEARS AGO. NOW VERY HIGH. WE'VE JUST HIT A RECORD. AND THE ETF FLOWS HAVE ACTUALLY  SURPRISED ME. I WAS A LITTLE SKEPTICAL THAT  THEY WOULD TAKE OFF QUICKLY, AND NOW WE HAVE CLOSE TO, I WANT TO  SAY, $50 BILLION, ABOUT 740,000  BITCOIN, HELD IN THESE ETFs. DAILY WE'RE GETTING BETWEEN 150  MILLION UP TO $500 MILLION  FLOWING IN.

IT WAS A RETAIL-DRIVEN, GLOBALLY RETAIL DRIVEN PHENOMENON, AND  NOW I WOULD SAY THERE IS A LOT  OF INSTITUTIONAL MONEY THAT  TRACKS IT. IT'S ALSO WHY YOU SEE SUCH  INTEREST IN DERIVATIVES. THE VOLATILITY IN BITCOIN I  THINK IS ONE THING THAT REALLY  ATTRACTS A LOT OF INSTITUTIONAL  INVESTORS. YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT, YOU KNOW, BITCOIN IS MAYBE THE ONLY  GLOBALLY TRADED ASSET THAT I  KNOW OF WHOSE DEMAND IS PURELY  BASED ON SENTIMENT. YOU KNOW, THERE'S NOT A BITCOIN  COMPANY. THERE ISN'T BITCOIN PRICE  EARNING RATIOS IT'S JUST A SENTIMENT DRIVEN  TOKEN. AND WHAT YOU CAN SAY ABOUT THAT, OF COURSE, IS THAT SENTIMENT HAS NO LIMITS. YOU CAN ALWAYS BE MORE  OPTIMISTIC. SO THIS RALLY MAY BE THE BIGGEST WE'VE SEEN. IF WE JUST LOOK AT WHERE WE  STAND TODAY, PRE-HALVENING FOR  BITCOIN AND LOOK AT HISTORICAL  PATTERNS, THAT WOULD SUGGEST,  I'M NOT PREDICTING THIS, IF YOU  APPLY THE HISTORICAL PATTERNS,  IT WOULD SUGGEST BITCOIN BEING  IN EXCESS OF $300,000 AT THE  PEAK OF THIS NEXT BULL MARKET.

A LOT OF WIND AND TORNADOES, THE TIMING FOR THAT IS DANGEROUS AS WE GET CLOSER TO THE NIGHTTIME HOURS WHEN TWISTERS TURN DEADLIER. THIS WEATHER IS NOT NORMAL FOR FEBRUARY. IN FEBRUARY. ILLINOIS AND INDIANA REPORTED A COUPLE DOZEN, VERSUS THE SOUTH, MISSISSIPPI AND ALABAMA A COUPLE HUNDRED. YOU KNOW WHAT IS TO BLAME? SOMETHING ELSE THAT IS NOT NORMAL FOR THIS TIME OF THE YEAR. THE TEMPERATURES THAT FEEL MORE LIKE SUMMER THAN WINTER. LOOK AT THIS. HIGHS IN A LOT OF PLACES, PROBABLY WHERE YOU ARE, CLOCKING IN 5-30 DEGREES ABOVE AVERAGE. MORE THAN 100 RECORDS SET IN THE LAST 24 HOURS, AND IN KANSAS, PEOPLE ARE LITERALLY OUT BUYING FLOWERS FOR THEIR GARDENS, DO NOT PUT THE JACKETS AWAY TOO QUICKLY. TOMORROW MORNING, WHIPLASH, A DRAMATIC DROP IN TEMPERATURES, 20-50 DEGREES. WE HAVE BILL KARINS COVERING THE LATEST. I WANT TO START LIVE OUTSIDE OF CHICAGO. THIS WARM WEATHER TO COLD WEATHER WHIPLASH COMES AT A HIGH PRICE. A BIG CONCERN ABOUT THE SEVERE WEATHER THAT KIND OF UNCERTAINTY IN THE SYSTEM PROMPTS, RIGHT? TALK US THROUGH IT.. >> Reporter: HALLIE, YOU ARE RIGHT. THAT SEVERE WEATHER IS EFFECTING NEARLY 41 MILLION PEOPLE ACROSS THE MIDWEST. WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN? WE COULD SEE TEMPERATURES DIP 50-60 DEGREES OVER THE NEXT 24 HOURS. NOW, THAT IS ACCORDING TO OUR FRIENDS AT THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE CHICAGO. AND, WITH THAT BRINGS A LOT OF CHALLENGES, THE 3 THINGS THEY ARE LOOKING AT, HAIL, THE SIZE, POTENTIALLY OF GOLF BALLS, THOSE TORNADOES THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT, HAPPENING OVERNIGHT. SO, KEEP YOUR PHONES CLOSE BY SO YOU HEAR THE WARNINGS IF THEY HAPPEN TO GO OFF. AND, THEN, AFTER ALL OF THIS, ONCE THE TEMPERATURES DIPPED, THE CITIES AND CITIES ACROSS THE MIDWEST PEOPLE LIVING THERE WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH ICY ROADS AND SLICK BRIDGES, HALLIE? >> SO, TALK ABOUT THE CRAZY TEMPERATURES WHERE YOU ARE ADRIAN? >> Reporter: SO, IT IS CHICAGO. NORMALLY STANDING OUTSIDE THIS TIME OF THE YEAR, I HAVE ON GLOVE, HATS, COATS, NONE OF THAT. EARLIER WE WERE AT LAKE MICHIGAN AND PEOPLE ARE THAT TAKING A DIP IN THE WATER THE HIGH FOR TODAY, 77 DEGREES. HERE IS WHAT FOLKS TOLD US.. >> DEFINITELY NOT THE WEATHER WE WOULD EXPECT IN FEBRUARY. IT USUALLY IS SUPER SNOWY, FREEZING, YOU KNOW, ICE EVERYWHERE. >> IT IS PERFECT THAT IS WHY I AM HERE. I CAME TO SWIM. >> Reporter: AND SHE WAS NOT KIDDING, WE WERE THERE WHEN SHE WAS SWIMMING IN LAKE MICHIGAN. TOMORROW, THE HIGH IS FOR THIS TO BE 27 DEGREES AND ON FRIDAY, 50. YOU CALLED IT WEATHER WHIPLASH I CALL IT AN EMOTIONAL ROLLER COASTER WHEN IT COMES TO THE TEMPERATURES, HALLIE? >> EMOTIONAL ROLLER COASTER, PHYSICAL ROLLER COASTER, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >>> METEOROLOGIST BILL KARINS DOES NOT OFTEN SEE A AHEAD IN A BIKINI IN FEBRUARY, BUT THIS SYSTEM IT IS GOING TO TRIGGER THE INTENSE WEATHER MAYBE IN THE NEXT HOUR OR TWO. >> WE ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE DANGEROUS. WE ARE WORRIED IF WE GET THE TORNADOES IN THE OVERNIGHT HOURS, HIT THE TOWN OR HOUSES OR BUSINESSES. THAT WILL BE THE CONCERN TONIGHT. WE CAN GET HUGE HAIL THAT CAN PUT DENTS IN CARS AND SMASH WINDSHIELDS, TOO. DOES NOT LOOK LIKE MUCH ON THE RADAR. THE POLAR AIR IS BACK HERE. THERE IS WHERE THE WARM AIR IS OUT AHEAD OF IT. THE WEATHER PREDICTION, TORNADO WATCH, WHAT A TORNADO WATCH MEANS THE INGREDIENTS THERE ARE FAVORABLE FOR TORNADOES IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS, CHICAGO IS INCLUDED IN THAT, MILWAUKEE YOU ARE NOT. DEICATEOR YOU ARE NOT, EITHER. SLIVER OF INDIANA AND A SMALL PORTION THEREOF WISCONSIN. THAT GOES UNTIL 10:00 THIS EVENING. I DO THINK WE WILL HAVE ADDITIONAL TORNADO WATCHES ISSUED LATER TONIGHT AND FROM ABOUT 10:00 P.M. UNTIL ABOUT 4:00 A.M. WE WILL BE CONCERNED WITH THE AREA ALONG THE OHIO RIVER. THIS IS THE ENHANCED REGION HERE. WE TALKED ABOUT THIS ONE. TORNADOES, LARGE AREA HERE, THROUGH OHIO, MAYBE NOT JUST A TORNADO A STRONG NIGHTTIME TORNADO AND THERE IS NOTHING SCARIER THAN THAT. LOUISVILLE, CINCINNATI AREA. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO GET WARNINGS FOR TORNADOES GOING THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT. YOU DON'T HEAR THE SIREN IN YOUR TOWN MAKE SURE YOU HAVE IT ON YOUR DEVICE OR WEATHER RADIO. IT IS A DANGEROUS EVENING. TALKING ABOUT THE INCREDIBLE RECORDS WE SET YESTERDAY. A COUPLE MORE TODAY. RODCHESTER, DETROIT. THE WARMEST FEBRUARY TEMPERATURE THEY EVER RECORDED. ST. LOUIS, 85 DEGREES, BROKE YOUR RECORD BY 6. THINGS WILL GET COOLED OFF. WITH THIS, BIG CHANGE, INCREDIBLE WIND. WE HAVE 112 MILLION PEOPLE, THAT IS 1 OUT OF 3 AMERICANS IS UNDER A WIND WARNING OR ADVISORY FROM THE WEST COAST TO THE NORTHEAST AND ALL OF THE WAY DOWN TO AREAS OF LOUISIANA. BIG TEMPERATURE CHANGES THAT MEANS THE AIR MASSES ARE CHANGING QUICKLY AND YOU WILL GET WIND GUSTS WITH IT. 45 IN BOSTON. NOT ENOUGH FOR WIDESPREAD POWER OUTAGES BUT THEY WILL BE ISOLATED THE TEMPERATURE PLUNGE, GUST I WINDS, CAUSING IT TO DROP 50. I HAVE BEEN WATCHING IT ALL DAY LONG TO SEE THE DIFFERENCE, PLACES LIKE NORTH DAKOTA, NEGATIVE 19, ST. LOUIS IS 85T. IS 104 DEGREES TEMPERATURE DIFFERENCE IF YOU WALK OUTSIDE FROM NORTH DAKOTA TO ST. LOUIS, THAT IS A SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM. >> I AM TELLING YOU IT IS TOUGH TO WRAP YOUR HEAD AROUND IT. BILL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH, WE WILL CHECK BACK IN WITH YOU TO SEE IF WE GET ANY OF THE TORNADO ALERTS OR WATCHES, APPRECIATE IT. >>> WE ARE A FEW HOURS AWAY FROM POLLS CLOSING IN MICHIGAN WHERE WE WILL GET OUR FIRST PREVIEW HOW VOTERS ARE FEELING IN WHAT COULD BE THE KEY SWING STATE IN NOVEMBER. PRESIDENT BIDEN FACING DOWN A PROTEST VOTE, DEMOCRATS UPSET HOW HE HANDLED THE ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR. HOW THEY ARE DECIDING TO VOTE UNCOMMITTED >> WE VOTED UNCOMMITTED IT. TO PUT THE PRESSURE ON THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION TO CALL FOR A CEASEFIRE. SO THAT WE CAN SEE PEACE. >> I AM HOPING THAT IT WILL TELL THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY THAT THEY ARE MAKING TERRIBLE DECISIONS. >> THE POLICY SHOULD BE CHANGED 100%. >> YOU HEARD FROM DEMOCRATS THERE ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE, FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP TRYING TO KEEP UP HIS WINNING STREAK AGAINST WINLESS NIKKI HALEY. BOTH CANDIDATES NOT BOTHERING TO TRAVEL TO MICHIGAN FOR PRIMARY NIGHT. TRUMP EXPECTED TO CRUISE THROUGH ANOTHER EASY VICTORY THERE. I WANT TO GET IN WITH SHAQUILLE BREWSTER. THE INTERESTING PART OF TONIGHT IS SO THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE, NOT THE REPUBLICAN SIDE, LET ME START THERE, RIGHT? >> THE THREAT TO BIDEN, THOUSANDS OF MAYBE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE VOTING UNCOMMITTED. THIS IS A MESSAGING VOTE TO BE CLEAR, RIGHT? NO REAL RISK THAT JOE BIDEN LOSES THE PRIMARY THERE BUT IT IS A MESSAGE AS IT RELATES TO PARTYUNECASION AS THEY HEAD INTO NOVEMBER. TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE EXPECTATIONS SETTING UP HERE. >> Reporter: YES, LET'S START WITH THE LISTEN TO MICHIGAN GROUP. THE GROUP THAT IS ORGANIZING TO GET PEOPLE TO VOTE UNCOMMITTED. THEY WANT THE GOAL TO HAVE 10,000 PEOPLE DO THAT. WHEN YOU TALK TO OFFICIALS WITH THAT GROUP, THEY SAY THEY ARE TRYING TO SEND A MESSAGE CLEARLY THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE, MEMBERS OF HIS BASE WHO HELPED HIM WIN AND HELPED HIM FLIP THE STATE BACK IN 2020 WHO ARE NO LONGER WITH HIM. THE NUMBER THAT THEY PUT ON THAT, IT IS 10,000. NOW, YOU CAN TELL THAT THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN AT LEAST HAS BEEN WATCHING AND AT LEAST PAYING ATTENTION TO THIS. THERE ARE COUNTERMESSAGING COMING FROM THE CAMPAIGN. THEY ARE SAYING WHEN YOU PUT IT IN FULL CONTEXT, THAT GOAL OF 10,000 IT IS NOT AS HIGH AND NOT AS SIGNIFICANT AS IT MIGHT APPEAR ON FIRST  BLUSH, LOOK AT THE NUMBERS, THE PAST THREE CYCLES THEY POINT OUT, THEY HAVE HAD ABOUT 20,000 VOTERS VOTE UNCOMMITTED. THERE IS AN EXCEPTION WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT, PARTY DYNAMICS, THEY ARE AYING EVEN THE GOAL, EVEN IF IT DOES HAPPEN IT IS NOT AS IMPRESSIVE AS IT MAY APPEAR ON THE SURFACE. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE POLLING, OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO SAY THEY ARE GOING TO BE VOTING UNCOMMITTED IN TODAY'S PRIMARY. WHEN THEY ARE ASKED WHO WILL THEY SUPPORT IN NOVEMBER, IF IT COMES DOWN TO DONALD TRUMP AND JOE BIDEN. THEY HAVE A MAJORITY OF THEM SAYING THEY ARE GOING BACK TO BIDEN, A GOOD CHUNK OF THEM SAYING THEY WILL SUPPORT TRUMP AND THEN MANY OF THEM WHO ARE UNDECIDED. THEY ARE TRYING TO SET OFF WARNING FLAGS SAYING WE ARE NOT HAPPY WITH YOUR CURRENT POLICY AND THAT YOU SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON GETTING OUR SUPPORT BACK >> THAT IS GOING TO BE THE INTERESTING THING TO WATCH TONIGHT. WHAT IS THAT NUMBER OF UNCOMMITTED. WHAT DO THEY HIT? 10,000? 20,000? MORE? WHAT IS THE RESPONSE. ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE, INTERESTING EXPECTATION GAME AFOOT WHEN IT RELATES TO NIKKI HALEY WHO IS PROMISING TO FIGHT ON THROUGH SUPER TUESDAY IN EARLY MARCH HERE. HER CAMPAIGN IS SUGGEST THAT PERHAPS EVEN 10% OF THE REPUBLICAN VOTE FOR NIKKI HALEY COULD BE A SIGNIFICANT WIN. HELP US UNDERSTAND THAT. ON A LOT OF PLANETS IT IS NOT A WIN IT WOULD BE A DEFEAT IF IT WERE TO COME TO BE BE >> AND, YOU ADD INTO THE FACTOR THAT IN THE GOP PRIMARY THE RULES BENEFIT SIGNIFICANTLY THE PERSON, THE CANDIDATE WHO GETS MORE THAN 50%. THEY GET THE LARGEST SHARE OF VOTES, NOW, THE RULES HERE IN MICHIGAN OR DELEGATES I SHOULD SAY, THEY GET MORE COMPLICATED. THERE IS DEFINITELY A MESSAGING BATTLE GOING ON AS WELL. NIKKI HALEY IS NOT IN THE STATE TODAY AS YOU MENTIONED. SHE IS GOING AHEAD AND LOOKING FORWARD TO THE SUPER TUESDAY STATE. SHE STARTS A NINE DAY OR NINE STATE SWING INTO SUPER TUESDAY. I WANT YOU TO LISTEN TO SOME OF THE VOTERS THAT I HAVE BEEN TALKING TO. NIKKI HALEY WAS HERE YESTERDAY. AND, SOME OF THAT MESSAGING THAT SHE HAS BEEN ARTICULATING HAS BEEN SEEPING DOWN TO THOSE CASTING THEIR BALLOTS, LISTEN HERE. >> I THINK SHE REPRESENTS A MORE REASONED VOICE. TIRED OF ALL OF THE NASTINESS HAVING TWO SOLID CANDIDATES IN THE FALL. I THINK IT IS MUCH BETTER THAN HAVING SOMEONE FACING THE CRIMINAL CHARGES.. >> Reporter: THAT LAST GENTLEMAN SAID HE WOULD SUPPORT JOE BIDEN IN THE GENERAL ELECTION BUT HE VOTED FOR NIKKI HALEY IN THE PRIMARY AS A WAY TO STOP TRUMP'S MOMENTUM. >> WATCHING ALL OF THIS THERE, WE WILL CHECK BACK IN WITH YOU, SHAQ, THANK YOU. >>> TO WASHINGTON NOW, A WORD TONIGHT, WE DON'T HEAR A LOT OF THESE DAYS WHEN IT COMES TO CONGRESS GETTING STUFF DONE. OPTIMISM. YES, OPTIMISM. THAT IS THE WORD FOR NOW. PRESIDENT BIDEN ALONGSIDE THE TOP 4 LEADERS, ONE CALLING AN INTENSE MEETING. THEY ALL SEEM TO AGREE. NO ONE WANTS A PARTIAL SHUTDOWN THAT COULD START MIDNIGHT ON FRIDAY. >> SHUTDOWN, DAMAGE THE ECONOMY SIGNIFICANTLY. AND I THINK WE ALL AGREE TO THAT AND WE NEED BIPARTISAN SOLUTION. >> SO, WHAT HAPPENS IN THERE WERE TO BE A PARTIAL GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN THIS WEEKEND? IT HITS FIRST, THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY, THE VA, HUD, MARCH 8th, NEXT WEEK, DEFENSE DEPARTMENTS, STATE DEPARTMENT, ET CETERA. THEIR WORKERS AND THOUSANDS OF OTHERS FURLOUGHED. THEY WOULD NOT GET PAID BUT SOME OF THEM STILL HAVE TO COME TO WORK. CHUCK SCHUMER SAID THINGS GOT FEISTY WHEN MONEY FOR UKRAINE CAME UP WITH HOUSE SPEAKER JOHNSON. >> THE MEETING ON UKRAINE WAS ONE OF THE MOST INTENSE I HAVE EVER ENCOUNTERED IN MY MANY MEETINGS IN THE OVAL OFFICE. >> LISTEN, HE HAD A LOT OF MEETINGS IN THE OVAL OFFICE. NOW, LET'S START WITH THE SHUTDOWN. AT THE END OF THE DAY NOBODY WANTS TO SHUTDOWN, HELP, HELP PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHAT THE HOLD UP IS TO PREVENT A SHUTDOWN THEN? >> Reporter: HALLIE, IF IT FEELS LIKE  DEJA VU IT IS. WE ARE HAVE BEEN ON THE BRINK OF SHUTDOWN. SOME OF THE CASES NARROWLY AVOIDED AT THE LAST MINUTE. THAT IS WHY THE WHITE HOUSE WANTED TO CALL THE LEADERS HERE TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION TO HOPEFULLY AVOID THIS AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN. BUT, THERE IS SOMETIMES LITTLE AGREEMENT ON HOW EXACTLY TO GET FROM POINT A TO POINT B. IF EVERYONE AGREES WE WANT TO GET TO POINT B. AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THERE IS NO SHUTDOWN. THE WHITE HOUSE N TERMS OF THEIR READING, THEY SAID IT WOULD BE UNACCEPTABLE TO BE HAVE ANY KIND OF A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN BECAUSE OF THE RAMIFICATIONS THAT YOU WERE LAYING OUT THERE IN THIS 2 TIERED PROCESS, PARTIAL ON FRIDAY AT MIDNIGHT IF IT HAPPENS BUT THEN IT WILL BE FULL A WEEK LATER IN THE MIDDLE OF ALL OF THAT IS THE PRESIDENT'S STATE OF THE UNION. THERE IS A BIG TOPIC THAT IS LOOMING OVER A LOT OF THIS THAT WE ARE GOING TO SEE A LOT OF ATTENTION ON THIS WEEK. THAT IS FUNDING FOR THE SOUTHERN BORDER. PRESIDENT BIDEN WILL BE TRAVELING THERE, WE KNOW IT IS SOMETHING THAT THE HOUSE SPEAKER MIKE JOHNSON RAISED REPORTEDLY AS BEING CONNECTED TO SOME OF THESE PRIORITIES AND OTHER FUNDING DEADLINES THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO JUGGLE. EVERYONE HAS THEIR AGENDA TO WHAT THEY WANT TO ACCOMPLISH. THEY SAY THEY HAVE A SHARED GOAL. WE WILL SEE IF WE CAN GET THERE IN THE END. >>> THE OPTICS OF THIS ASIDE, SHOWING SOME OF THE VIDEO, IT IS INTERESTING HERE TO SEE HOUSE SPEAKER JOHNSON IN THE ROOM THERE WITH THE PRESIDENT, THE VICE PRESIDENT, THE LEADERS AND YOU HEARD THE TOP SENATE DEMOCRAT COME OUT AND SAY YEAH, IT WAS INTENSE WHEN IT CAME TO FUNDING FOR UKRAINE. ADDITIONAL MONEY FROM THE U.S. TO UKRAINE. JOHNSON MADE THAT A NONISSUE. DO WE KNOW ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT WHY THINGS GOT SO INTENSE IF THERE WERE FIREWORKS WHAT IT WAS ABOUT? >> Reporter: WE HAVE A LITTLE WINDOW INTO IT. THAT IS PARTIALLY BECAUSE THE CIA DIRECTOR WAS IN THE MEETING AND HE GAVE A PRESENTATION ON THE IMPLICATIONS HERE WITH LONG STORY SHORT MEANS IN UKRAINE DOES NOT GET THIS PROPER FUNDING THEY WILL LOSE THIS WAR. THAT WAS THE BOTTOM LINE, THAT IS WHY SENATOR SCHUMER SAID IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS SO DIRE. IT NEEDS TO HAPPEN IN A MATTER OF WEEKS OR THE CONSEQUENCES COULD BE DIRE, HALLIE? >> OUTSIDE OF THE WHITE HOUSE, THANKS. >>> TO GEORGIA TONIGHT, DRAMATIC, TENSE NEW TESTIMONY ON A KEY QUESTION RELATED TO THE INVESTIGATION AGAINST FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP. WHEN DID THE FULTON COUNTY DA DATING THE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR? YOU GOT THE JUDGE CALLING BRADLEY BACK TO THE STAND TRYING TO GET CLARITY HERE. THE EX-DIVORCE LAWYER FOR THAT EXPROSECUTOR WHO WAS IN THE COURTROOM. THE LAWYER FOR ONE OF TRUMP'S CO-DEFENDANTS ASKING REPORTED QUESTIONS, THIS WENT ON FOR HOURS TO TRY TO FILL IN THIS TIME LINE HERE, RIGHT? WHEN DID THEY START DATING? BUT, THE ATTORNEY, BRADLEY, SAID HE JUST CAN NOT SAY, WATCH. >> THERE WAS NOT A SPECIFIC DATE. THERE WAS NOT A FOOTBALL GAME. THERE WAS NOTHING THAT I CAN ATTRIBUTE TO HIM TELLING ME WHEREVER. AT THIS TIME I AM TELLING YOU THAT I DO NOT HAVE THE DATE. >> OKAY. REMEMBER WHY THIS MATTERS, THE JUDGE HERE COULD KICK THE DA, WILLOWS, OFF OF THIS CASE OVER THE ALLEGATIONS FOR THE TRUMP TEAM SHE MAY OF BENEFITED FINANCIALLY AND INAPPROPRIATELY. THE TRUMP TEAM SAYS IT IS ALL ABOUT THE TIME LINE. THEY SAY THEY STARTED DATING IN EARLY 2022 AFTER SHE HIRED HIM. ONE EVER THE FORMER FRIENDS SAID NO IT STARTED BACK IN 2019. WHAT WE ARE STILL NOT GETTING HERE, WHAT WE HAVE NOT SEEN TOUCHED IS ANY DIRECT EVIDENCE THAT THE DA FINANCIALLY BENEFITED FROM THIS RELATIONSHIP WHICH IS THE CRUX OF THE ALLEGATION AGAINST IT, FAIR? >> IT IS NOT ONLY FAIR BUT I AM GLAD YOU ARE BRINGING IT UP. IT REALLY SHOULD BE THE REASON WHY A DISQUALIFICATION SHOULD HAPPEN. IF THERE IS A CONFLICT OF INTEREST BECAUSE SHE INITIALLY PUT WADE IN THE JOB, HER THEN BOYFRIEND, THEY ARE NOT DATING ANY MORE. SHE IS NOT CONTINUING TO GET A FINANCIAL BENEFIT. BUT IF SHE DID IT TO GET THIS PERSONAL BENEFIT THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE, RIGHT? YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE A PROSECUTOR TRYING TO DO A MONEY GRAB BECAUSE HER BOYFRIEND HAS THIS JOB. BUT THIS HEARING VEERED OFF COURSE AND ENTERED INTO A SIDESHOW WHEN THEY BEGAN DATING. BUT, I AM NOT GOING TO BE FLIPPANT ABOUT IT. IT IS RELEVANT IF PERJURY HAS BEEN COMMITTED. DID THEY LIE ABOUT WHEN THAT RELATIONSHIP BEGAN? THEN THAT DOES SPEAK TO THE DEFENSE'S THEORY THAT WILLIS MADE OF HAD MOTIVATION TO PUT HER BOYFRIEND INTO A CUSH JOB. REMEMBER, BRADLEY WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE STAR WITNESS FOR THE DEFENSE WHEN HE TOOK THE STAND TWO WEEKS AGO HE OFFERED LIMITED TESTIMONY. TODAY WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A HUGE BLOCKBUSTER EVENT AND TAKE A QUICK LISTEN AS TO SPECIFICALLY WHAT HE HAD TO SAY ABOUT WHY HE SHARED ANY INFORMATION ABOUT HIS FORMER CLIENT WITH THE LAWYER. >> NO ONE TOLD ME I WAS SPECULATING. >> NO ONE TOLD YOU THAT? >> NO ONE TOLD ME THAT. >> WAS IT SPECULATION WHEN YOU TOLD ME THAT? WAS IT BASED ON THINGS THAT HAD BEEN TOLD TO YOU? >> I NEVER WITNESSED ANYTHING. >> SPECULATION? I NEVER WITNESSED ANYTHING. HALLIE, THAT IS NOT EVIDENCE. IN THE ABSENCE OF EVIDENCE, THE JUDGE MAY NOT HAVE ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO DISQUALIFY WILLIS. >> WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THIS HAS BEEN, WE HAVE SEEN SOME REAL INTENSE MOMENTS THROUGH THE COURSE OF THE WHOLE DISCUSSION, YOU KNOW, THESE QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS RELATIONSHIP. WILLIS, REMEMBER WHEN SHE TOOK THE STAND. LET ME REMIND PEOPLE WHAT THAT MOMENT WAS LIKE. >> THESE PEOPLE ARE ON TRIAL FOR TRYING TO STEAL AN ELECTION IN 2020. I AM NOT ON TRIAL NO MATTER HOW HARD YOU TRY TO PUT ME ON TRIAL. WHAT YOU ARE REALLY ASKING ABOUT. I THINK HE LIED RIGHT HERE, RIGHT HERE, NO, NO, THERE IS THE TRUTH RIGHT HERE. THEY LIE! >> FIRED UP ABOUT THIS, AND PART OF THIS, SHE LAID IT OUT HERE ARE THE STAKES OF WHAT IS AT PLAY. THIS ELECTION INTERFERENCE CASE AGAINST FORMER TRUMP, BIG PICTURE HERE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE WATCHING THAT ARE NOT TUNED INTO THE INS AND OUTS HERE IS WHAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW RELATED TO THIS RELATIONSHIP THAT SHE HAD? COULD IT DERAIL THE ENTIRE CASE? >> YES, BECAUSE IN THE STATE OF GEORGIA IF A PROSECUTOR IS DISQUALIFIED THE ENTIRE OFFICE OF THAT IS DISQUALIFIED AND THE CASE GETS KICKED OFF TO A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR WHO WILL DECIDE WHAT NEW OFFICE WILL TAKE IT. WHAT NEW OFFICE GETS IT, BECAUSE IT COULD TAKE A LONG TIME THE NEW OFFICE COULD DECIDE NOT TO PURSUE ALL OF THE CHARGES THAT FANI WILLIS OBTAINED FROM A GRAND JURY WHO KNOWS WHAT COULD HAPPEN TO THAT HUGE RICO COULDN'T THAT TRUMP IS FACING BUT ALL OF THE OTHER REMAINING DEFENDANTS. >> ANY TIME LINE WHEN WE WILL KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS? WHEN THE JUDGE WILL MAKE THIS DECISION? >> QUICKLY, SUMMATIONS ARE ON FRIDAY AT 1:00, WE SHOULD GET A WRITTEN ORDER WITHIN THE NEXT 7- 10 DAYS >> WOW. LOTS TO WATCH OVER THE COURSE OF THIS MONTH, KATIE PHANG, APPRECIATE YOU BEING WITH US. >>> HAMAS, ISRAEL, BOTH POURING COLD WATER ON THE SURPRISE COMMENTS FROM PRESIDENT BIDEN SUGGESTING A CEASEFIRE COULD HAPPEN AS SOON AS MONDAY. REMEMBER WHEN HE SAID THAT AT THE ICE CREAM SHOP WITH SETH MEYERS WE BROUGHT IT TO YOU AS BREAKING NEWS, 24 HOURS NOW IT DOES NOT SEEM LIKE ISRAELI IS SO THE SAME PAGE. THEY SAID THEY DID NOT KNOW PRESIDENT BIDEN WAS GOING TO SAY THAT. HAMAS IS GIVING THE SAME MESSAGE HERE, TOO. >> NOW, WE ARE LIVE IN TEL AVIV, WHAT IS UP WITH THIS WHIPLASH? THE PRESIDENT CAME OUT, YOU KNOW, IN THIS CASUAL SETTING SAYING, YEAH, MAYBE THIS WEEKEND, BY NEXT MONDAY, I AM HOPEFUL. COME OVER SEAS, BOTH SIDES, ISRAEL, HAMAS, DISMISSIVE QUICKLY WHERE DO THINGS STAND? >> ISRAEL AND HAMAS DON'T AGREE ON VERY MUCH, THEY SEEM TO BE ON THE SAME PAGE ON THIS MONDAY DEADLINE THAT THE PRESIDENT MENTIONED IN THE ICE CREAM SHOP IN NEW YORK CITY IT IS NEWS TO THEM. ISRAELI OFFICIALS WERE SURPRISED. THEY DID NOT GET ANY HEAD'S UP FROM THE WHITE HOUSE THAT THIS WAS A DEADLINE, A GOAL, AN ASPIRATION THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN WAS GOING TO BE SETTING. WE DID HEAR A STATEMENT FROM PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU EARLIER TONIGHT, HE MADE ABSOLUTELY NO MENTION OF A DEAL AND INSTEAD HE SAYS HE BELIEVES HE HAS ENOUGH SUPPORT TO CONTINUE HIS MILITARY CAMPAIGN INSIDE OF GAZA FROM\\nHAMAS'S PERSPECTIVE. HAMAS'S PERSPECTIVE. THEY HAMAS PERSPECTIVE THEY ARE CALLING HIM A HYPOCRITE. THEY ARE SAYING AT THIS POINT, ANY TALK OF A DEAL IS PREMATURE. WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT THE NEGOTIATIONS AT THIS POINT ARE FOCUSED ON A PROPOSAL LAID OUT BY CIA DIRECTOR BILL BURNES. IT INVOLVES A PAUSE IN RIGHTING UP TO SIX WEEKS, THUNDER DEAL, HAMAS WOULD RELEASE 40 HOSTAGES INCLUDING WOMEN WHO WERE SUPPOSED TO COME OUT IN THE LAST DEAL BACK IN NOVEMBER. IN RETURN, ISRAEL EXPECTED TO RELEASE HUNDREDS OF PALESTINIAN PRISONERS, POTENTIALLY INCLUDING SOME WHO ARE SERVING LONG JAIL SENTENCES FOR MURDER, FOR TERRORISM, FOR OTHER SERIOUS OFFENSES, BUT, BOTH SIDES ARE SAYING THERE ARE MAJOR CAPS STILL OUTSTANDING,\\nONE OF THE BIG QUESTIONS, WHAT ONE OF THE BIG QUESTIONS, WHAT\\nEXACTLY IS THE RATIO OF PRISONER EXACTLY IS THE RATIO OF PRISONER PRISONERS AND HOSTAGES. WITH THEY WITHDRAWAL. THEY ARE SAYING THAT IS A NONSTARTER. >> THANK YOU. >>> COMING UP, WHY PRINCE WILLIAM SUDDENLY PULLED OUT OF A SERVICE FOR HIS GOD FATHER AND WHAT THE PALACE IS SAYING ALL ABOUT THE KATE MIDDLETON HEALTH RUMORS. >>> GOOGLE'S PLAN TO BRING BACK THE AI GENERATOR AFTER IT >> WHAT WAS IT LIKE GETTING THAT. >> STREAMING NOW. >>> LATE TODAY, A NEW BILL HAS BEGUN WORKING ITS WAY THROUGH ALABAMA THAT PROTECTS IVF10 DAYS AFTER THAT COURT RULING THERE SAYING FROZEN EMBRYOS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED PEOPLE F. IT SEEMS LIKE THINGS HAVE BEEN HAPPENING IN LIGHTNING SPEED IN ALABAMA THIS IS NOT ON THE STATE HOUSE RADAR A WEEK AGO. LOOK AT THIS. THE COURT RULING, THEY CAME DOWN. COMES DOWN FEBRUARY 16th. WITH THE FIRST CLINIC SUSPENDING IVF TREATMENT ON FEBRUARY 21st TWO MORE FOLLOWED. LAST FRIDAY, DEMOCRATS INTRODUCED A BILL TO PROTECT IVF, OVER THE WEEKEND THE EXPLOSIVE DETONATED AT THE AG'S OFFICE. ALABAMA LAW ENFORCEMENT IS INVESTIGATING THAT. TWO BILLS INTRODUCED IN THE SENATE BOTH BY REPUBLICANS. ALL OF THIS HAPPENING AS THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION HEALTH OFFICIAL IS MEETING TODAY WITH FAMILIES AND DOCTORS IN ALABAMA WHO SAY THEIR LIVES AND PRACTICES HAVE BEEN THROWN INTO CHAOS BY THIS COURT RULING. ALL OF THIS. HIGHLIGHTS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ISSUE OF REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS IN A PRESIDENTIAL YEAR. >> WE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WHAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO DO TO TRY TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF PEOPLE WHO WANT TO ACCESS THEIR HEALTH CARE RIGHTS WHEN ROE WENT DOWN AND\\nTOOK AWAY HEALTH CARE RIGHTS TOOK AWAY HEALTH CARE RIGHTS AND ACCESS IT DID IT TO MORE THAN JUST ABORTION CARE. >> KATHY, IT SHOWS THE WAY THIS IS SUCH A BIG DEAL. NOT JUST IN ALABAMA BUT NATIONALLY AS WELL. I KNOW YOU HAVE BEEN TALKING TO FAMILIES TODAY. WALK US THROUGH WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN HEARING. >> HEY, THERE, HALLIE. THAT IS RIGHT. IT HAS BEEN A ROLLER COASTER OF AN EMOTION FOR THEM, TACKLING IVF AND THEN POTENTIAL EMBRYO TRANSFER AND THEN THEY TELL ME IT REALLY HAS BEEN A GUT PUNCH WHEN THE RULING CAME DOWN. THE RIPPLE EFFECT HAS BEEN PRETTY QUICK AND THE BACKLASH\\nAS BEEN QUICK. AS BEEN QUICK. WE SAW MOVEMENT TODAY AS YOU MENTIONED TWO REPUBLICANS HAVE INTRODUCED LEGISLATION TO PRESERVE IVF AND LAST WEEK WE HAD A SIMILAR BILL THAT WAS INTRODUCED BY THE DEMOCRATIC HOUSE MINORITY LEADER, ANTHONY DANIELS BUT REALLY, HALLIE, IVF, I WAS TOLD, TIME AND TIME AGAIN TIMING IS EVERYTHING AND HAVING TO DEAL WITH THIS ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE HAS BEEN EXTREMELY CHALLENGING. YOU MENTIONED THE TOP HEALTH OFFICIAL WAS IN TOWN HERE IN BIRMINGHAM HAVING A ROUND TABLE WITH IVF PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS GOING THROUGH THEIR STORIES, THEIR STRUGGLES. AND JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO, ACTUALLY, A MOMENT AGO, WE SPOKE TO HANNAH MILES AND SHE IS ALSO AN IVF PATIENT AND HAS AN EMBRYO TRANSFER HAPPENING IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS. SHE SAYS EVERYTHING IS UP IN THE AIR AT THIS POINT, TAKE A LISTEN. >> WE, MORE THAN ANYONE KNOW THAT AN EMBRYO DOES NOT EQUAL A CHILD BECAUSE IF IT DID I WOULD BE PREGNANT. >> THE EMBRYO THAT WE WANT TO BE DESPERATELY TO BE A CHILD. [CRYING] >> IT NEVER WILL BE. >> Reporter: HALLIE TO ADD TO THE CONVERSATION THAT I JUST HAD, SHE SAID THE FINANCIAL TOLL HAS BEEN GREAT. SHE SPENT $40,000 OUT-OF-POCKET AND THIS TRANSFER THAT IS COMING UP SHE DOES NOT KNOW IF IT IS GOING TO MOVE FORWARD F. IT DOES SHE DOES NOT KNOW IF IT WILL STICK. A GAMBLE SHE IS TAKING, ONE OF THOUSANDS HERE IN THE STATE DEALING WITH THE SAME THING, TOMORROW, WE WILL BE HEARING THEIR COLLECTIVE VOICES AT THE STATE CAPITOL IN GON MONTGOMERY, ALABAMA. THEY PLAN ON SPENDING A MESSAGE THAT SOMETHING HAS TO  CHANGE. THEY ARE HELD HOSTAGE AND THEY ARE SAYING THIS RULING IS DOING THE SAME THING. >> THANK YOU FOR BEING THERE AND BRINGING US THAT REPORTING. APPRECIATE IT. >>> LET'S GET YOU OVER TO THE FIVE THINGS OUR TEAM THINKS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT TONIGHT. NUMBER ONE, TWO MEN CONVICTED IN THE MURDER, CONVICTED OF MURDER, RATHER, OF JAM MASTER J FROM RUN DMC. THEY KILLED HIM IN A DRUG DEAL IN 2002. >>> BUSINESS HEADLINES, SONY IS LAYING OFF PEOPLE.

THE FDA SAYS IT IS WORRIED HOW STERILE THINGS ARE IN THE FACILITY. PEOPLE CAN END UP WITH EYE INFECTIONS, THE COMPANY HAS NOT HEARD OF PROBLEMS SO FAR. >>> PRINCE WILLIAM PULLED OUT OF THE MEMORIAL SERVICE FOR HIS GOD FATHER. WHY THE PALACE SAYS IT IS A PERSONAL MATTER. DID NOT SAY MUCH ELSE ON WHAT THAT PERSONAL MATTER WAS. PRINCESS KATE IS STILL DOING WELL AS SHE RECOVERS AFTER RUMORS OF HER BEING ON A COMA. THE PALACE PUSHED BACK ON THAT CALLING IT LUDICROUS. A BOX OF HOCKEY CARDS WENT FOR $3.4 MILLION. 48 PACKS OF HOCKEY CARDS. POTENTIALLY WAYNE GET GRETZI, THE BOX IS MORE RARE THAN THE CARDS. HOW ABOUT THIS ONE? FLEX PRICING FOR A FROSTY? SURGE PRICING LIKE UBER BUT AT THE DRIVE-THRU. WENDYS WILL BE CHANGING PRICES HOW DEMAND THEY ARE, THE TIMING, THE WEATHER COULD PLAY A PART IN IT. WE HAVE MORE ON THIS. WENDYS IS CALLING THIS EXPERIMENT WITH AI SUGGESTIVE SELLING. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS DO YOU? >> THEY WILL UP SELL WHEREVER THEY CAN. CONSUMERS ARE USED TO THIS FROM TICKET MASTER AND UBER FOR PRODUCTS IN HIGH DEMAND. FAST FOOD THERE ARE OTHER CHOICES. BUT, WENDY'S IS SEEING WHAT OTHER INDUSTRIES AND COMPANIES WITHIN THE FAST FOOD SPACE THAT ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHEN THEY CAN UP SELL ITEMS, RAISE THE PRICE ON THINGS AND LOWER PRICES ON SOME THINGS THAT ARE NOT SELLING WELL. THAT SUGGESTIVE SELLING WE ARE USED TO WITH OTHER INDUSTRIES WE WILL HAVE TO GET USED TO IT IN FAST FOOD. IT IS AN EXPERIMENT THEY ARE GOING TO DO IN 2025. YOU WILL EXPECT OTHERS TO FOLLOW, TOO >> CAN WE? I WONDER ABOUT SHOPPER BACKLASH. IT IS NOT AS THOUGH THEY HAVE A LOCK ON THE FAST FOOD MARKET, FOLKS HAVE A LOT OF CHOICES >> THEY DO. IF YOU ARE A BACONATOR FAN OR FROSTY, YOU WILL STICK WITH IT. BUT ONE THING TO CONSIDER IS WENDY'S LIKE A LOT OF OTHER CHAINS RELIES ON THE FRANCHISES, THEY HAVE 6800 RESTAURANTS, 86% OF OWNED BY SMALL BUSINESSES THEY WILL HAVE TO FOLLOW SUIT. THEY CAN FACE THE BACKLASH AS WELL. FOOD PRICES HAVE BEEN HIGH, DINING OUT, ESPECIALLY FAST FOOD IT HAS GONE UP 20% SINCE PREPANDEMIC, HIGHER PRICES WILL HANG ON CONSUMERS. YOU ARE RIGHT. THEY HAVE CHOICES AND THEY ARE ABOUT 20-30 FEET AWAY AT ANOTHER RESTAURANT. >> WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE IN PRICING, A BURGER IS $3.69. WHATEVER. ARE WE SAYING IT CAN GO UP TO, THAT IS THE AVERAGE PRICE, FRENCH FRIES, $1.79. WOULD WE SEE A $10 FROSTY OR 10 CENT FROSTY? WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR THE DOLLARS AND CENTS. >> IT DEPENDS TIME OF DAY. LUNCHTIME CROWD YOU CAN SEE THEM SURGE FOR THAT DAVE'S DOUBLE, TO $1 OR $2 MORE. THEY ARE NOT BEING SPECIFIC BUT THE POINT IS TO USE AI, DIGITAL MENUS TO SEE WHERE THE DEMAND IS. THIS IS COMMON WITH McDONALD'S. WENDY'S IS TRYING TO GET INTO IT AS WELL TO MANAGE THEIR INVENTORY BETTER, UP SELL THE THINGS NOT SELLING WELL AND CHARGE MORE FOR THE THINGS THAT ARE. CONSUMERS, THIS WILL NOT FEEL GOOD. FOLKS THAT ARE SHOPPING AND EATING AT WENDY'S THEY ARE ON A BUDGET. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT.\\nWE WILL SEE.

QUICKLY. SPIRAL IN THE DEBATE. ELON MUSK CALLING IT SUPER RACIST AND SEXIST. OTHERS ARE SAYING THEY ARE TOO WOKE OUT THERE. REPRESENTING THE DEEPER POLITICAL BIAS. THE FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE AMONG THOSE, TAKING ISSUE WITH THE WAY THAT THIS AI WAS TRAINED BY GOOGLE HE SAYS IT REFLECTS SOME OF THE BIAS OF THE CREATORS AND IDEOLOGY. THE AI MODEL BY GOOGLE IS REFLECTING WHAT HE CALLED THE CULTURAL ORTHODOX THAT PRO VADES SILICONE VALLEY. A LOT OF POLITICS BUT IT IS COSTING GOOGLE BILLIONS, YESTERDAY THE STOCK WAS DOWN 4%. A COUPLE, ALMOST A TRILLION. THE RISK. A BIG NUMBER. IT IS A TOUGH WEEK FOR THIS COMPANY. >> WELL, THEY ARE FINDING THEMSELVES IN A PLACE THAT A LOT OF BUSINESSES POTENTIALLY FIND UNCOMFORTABLE. WE HAVE SEEN IT IN THE PAST THAT IS IN THE CROSS HAIRS OF THE CULTURAL WARS MORE BROODILY. >> ABSOLUTELY, ABSOLUTELY. ESPECIALLY FOR SILICONE VALLEY. AI ENGINEERS DON'T WANT TO GET CAUGHT UP IN THIS DISCUSSION AND POLITICAL DEBATE. AI AND ENGINEERING TALENT IT IS SO HARD TO COME BY RIGHT NOW. THAT IS POTENTIAL IMPLICATION GOING FORWARD. WILL THEY HAVE TROUBLE RECRUITING PEOPLE IF THEY ARE SEEING BIAS IN SOME WAY? THEY DISABLED THE IMAGE GENERATION TOOL. THEY ARE SAYING WE MISSED THE MARK. INACCURATE. IT CALLS INTO QUESTION HOW IT HAPPENS, THE CEO IS NOW UNDER FIRE. IT IS A LAUNCH AT A TIME WHEN THEY ARE TRYING TO BE COMPETING AS A LEADER. THEY WERE SEEN ON CUTTING EDGE.

THEY NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS. THE POLICE NEVER CAME HERE BEFORE. NOT ANYMORE. THE DRUG GANGS HAVE BEEN DRIVING TERRORISTS, SECURITY FORCES PRETTY MUCH DO WHATEVER THEY WANT. SWARMING THROUGH APARTMENT BLOCKS, FORCING THEIR WA INSIDE. FOR SOME, IT IS CLEARLY TERRIFYING. A PLAN AND HIS CHILDREN COWER ON THE FLOOR AS THEY ARE STORMING IN TELLING THEM TO STAY WHERE THEY ARE. THEY HAVE DONE NOTHING WRONG. INDEED, NOBODY WAS ARRESTED IN THIS SWEEP. >> THE POLICE ARE GOING HOUSE TO HOUSE, DOOR TO DOOR, BANGING INTO APARTMENTS, BUT PEOPLE ARE VERY UNHAPPY ABOUT WHAT THEY FEEL, INVASION OF THEIR PRIVACY. THEY SAY THEY GOT TO LOOK FOR DRUGS AND GANG MEMBERS WHEREVER THEY WANT TO, PEOPLE OUTSIDE ARE UNHAPPY. PEOPLE IN HERE ARE UNHAPPY,\\nTOO. TOO. >> OUTSIDE, YOUNG MEN ARE HELD WITH HANDS ABOVE THEIR HEAD. THEIR FAMILIES START OBJECTING. IT IS TENSE.\\nTHE POLICE ARE UNCOMPROMISED. . . >> WE ALL HAVE MOTHERS, THEY ARE MY CHILDREN, THEY ARE FAMILY, ALL OF THEM. NO ONE HERE IS. THEY ARE ALL GOOD, HARDWORKING PEOPLE. ALL OF US HERE WORK. GOOD PEOPLE, THERE IS NOTHING HERE. >> Reporter: COMMANDING OFFICER IS ABSOLUTELY RESOLUTE IN HIS BELIEF THAT THESE OPERATIONS ARE BRINGING ABOUT CHANGE.\\n>> LOCAL OBJECTIONS HE SAYS, >> LOCAL OBJECTIONS HE SAYS, PART OF THE PROCESS TO STAMP >> ALL RIGHT. >>> NBC NEWS COVERS HUNDREDS OF STORIES EVERY DAY. BECAUSE IT CAN BE TOUGH TO READ OR WATCH OR LISTEN TO THEM ALL, OUR TEAMS HAVE DONE IT FOR YOU. THERE IS WHAT IS GOING DOWN IN THEIR REGIONS IN A SEGMENT WE CALL THE LOCAL. >>> DISNEYWORLD, FACING A NEW LAWSUIT CLAIMING A WOMAN DIED OF AN ALLERGIC REACTION AFTER EATING AT A RESTAURANT AT THE PARK THE RESTAURANT WAS NEGLIGENT AND AWARE OF HIS WIFE'S VERY SERIOUS FOOD ALLERGY. ACCORDING TO THE AUTOPSY REPORT, SHE DIED HOURS LATER. DISNEY PARKS AND RESORTS HAVE NOT RESPONDED TO OUR REQUEST FOR COMMENT. >>> POLICE IN PHILLY ARE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE WHO ESCAPED AFTER BEING TREATED IN A HOSPITAL APPARENTLY IN HANDCUFFS WHEN HE RAN OFF. HE WAS IN CUSTODY FOR STEALING A CAR. THEY ARE INVESTIGATING, WANT ANYONE WHO SEES HIM TO CALL 911. >> MVP, CAM NEWTON, GETTING INTO SOME KIND OF, I DON'T KNOW, FIGHT, ALTERCATION, WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT. HE IS HERE WEARING A HAT, HE PARENTS AND THOSE VERY SAD KIDS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, APPRECIATE YOU BEING WITH US. >>> COMING UP HERE ON THE SHOW, WHY AGENTS WANT NFL PROSPECTS TO SKIP ONE OF THE THINGS THEY USE TO CHECK THEM OUT FOR THE DRAFT. THE BIG STAR SAYING IT IS NOT WORTH IT.\\nTHE MIND GAMES, COMING UP >>> WE KNOW THE SUPER BOWL JUST >>> WE KNOW THE SUPER BOWL JUST HAPPENED BUT ALREADY THE NEXT SEASON IS IN SWING BY NOW, WHY? BECAUSE OF THE NFL COMBINE.\\nTHAT IS WHEN THE GUYS THAT WANT THAT IS WHEN THE GUYS THAT WANT TO BE DRAFTED AT THE END OF APRIL. >>> TWO BIG NAMED AGENTS TELLING THE PLAYERS DO NOT TAKE\\nTHE COGNATIVE TEST. THE COGNATIVE TEST. A SCORE WAS LEAKED LAST YEAR. WINNING THE LEAGUE'S AWARD, LEADING THE TEAM TO TH PLAYOFFS. THE NFL HAS DONE THIS TEST, THIS TEST FOR YEARS, NOW, ACCUSATIONS THEY HAVE A RACIAL BIAS THESE TESTS. IS THIS NEW ONE SUPPOSED TO CUT IT OUT? YOU NOW HAVE, AGAIN, A BLACK ATHLETE WITH WHISPERS ABOUT HOW SMART HE IS. >> EXPERTS HAVE SAID A LOT OF THINGS ABOUT THE TEST. THE OLD TEST THAT EXISTED AS ONE THAT IS USED WIDELY, NOT JUST FOR FOOTBALL PLAYERS BUT ALSO FOR COMPANIES TO TRY TO EVALUATE THABILITY. THIS IS A TEST USED FOR A LONG TIME. SO, THE NEW TEST THAT IS BEING -- EVALUATE THAT ABILITY. THIS IS A TEST USED FOR A LONG TIME. SO, THE NEW TEST THIS IS BEING USED IT IS A SPECIFIC TEST, REACTION TIME, SPEED, HOW THEY REACT UNDER STRESS, THESE THINGS ARE DIFFERENT. THAT IS WHY THEY HAVE BEEN REPLACING THE TEST WITH THE F2 TEST, THE OLD ONES NOT USED BY THE NFL. SO, THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS THAT ARE BEING LOOKED AT. AND HOW THEY DO THE TEST. THE FIRST TEST IS A TEST THAT TAKES 12 MINUTES, A SERIES OF QUESTION THAT HAVE TO BE ANSWERED. IT LOOKED AT MATH AND VOCABULARY, THAT WAS THE OLD ONE. THE NEW ONE USES TECHNOLOGY FOR PLAYERS TO KEEP TRACK OF OBJECTS FOR A QUARTERBACK IT CAN TEST THEIR ABILITY THAT THE QUARTERBACK CAN LOOK AT AN OBJECT OR A FEW OBJECTS THAT IS SOMETHING THEY DO WHEN THEY ARE DOING ON THE FIELD. THE PLAYERS COMING AGAINST THEM AND THROWING THE BALL TO. THESE ARE THE ARGUMENT THAT HAVE BEEN MADE BY THOSE THAT CREATED THE TEST AND THAT IS WHY HALF OF THE TEAMS IN THE NFL ARE USING THAT TEST TO EVALUATE THE QUARTERBACK. REMEMBER, THESE ARE TEAMS, HALLIE, INVESTING A LOT OF MONEY WHEN THEY DRAFT A PLAYER. THAT IS WHY THEY BROUGHT IN THE SECOND TEST, THE F2, THAT IS WHY IT IS SO POPULAR. >> OKAY. BUT, SO, YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE RATIONAL TO USE IT FOR QUARTERBACKS, RIGHT? YOU GOT OTHERS LIKE FOR EXAMPLE, SOME OF THE AGENCIES SAYING IT IS NOT RIGHT FOR APTITUDE TO BE PART OF RIDICULE, NO OTHER JOB INTERVIEW CARRIES THAT SCRUTINY. WHAT IF MY TEST SCORES LEAKED AND HOW WOULD I FEEL ABOUT THAT. STROUD, STILL A GREAT PLAYER. >> Reporter: CORRECT, ATHLETES FIRST, THE AGENCY THAT IS ADVISING THEM NOT TO TAKE THE TEST BROUGHT IT UP. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE QUARTERBACK, WHAT HAPPENED WHEN LAST YEAR OR TWO YEARS AGO STROUD TOOK THE TEST. ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH HIS TEST IS THAT THE INFORMATION WAS LEAKED. THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE PRIVATE INFORMATION, THE COMPANY DOES THE TEST AND THAT INFORMATION IS DELIVERED TO THE TEAMS, BUT, THE INFORMATION WAS LEAKED. THEN, THAT, OF COURSE, EFFECTED THE PLAYER. FOR NOW, WE HAVE THESE AGENTS WHO ARE ADVISING THE PLAYERS NOT TO TAKE THOSE COGNITIVE TESTS, THEN YOU LOOK AT THE OTHER SIDE, OTHER QUARTERBACKS LIKE BROCK PURDY, PATRICK MAHOMES, SOME OF THE BEST QUARTERBACKS IN THE NFL THAT TESTED VERY WELL IN THE TEST. NOW, HERE IS WHAT IS DIFFICULT. BECAUSE WE CAN NOT GO ON A SERVER AND SEE HOW EVERYONE SCORED BUT SOME INFORMATION HAS BEEN LEAKED WHERE WE KNOW WHICH QUARTERBACKS DID WELL AND SOME THAT DID NOT. THERE IS SAN ARGUMENT FOR THOSE THAT TESTED VERY WELL WHO ARE NOW DOING WELL IN THE LEAGUE. I THINK WHAT WE SHOULD LOOK AT HERE, MOVING FORWARD, HALLIE, THIS IS A TEST THAT WORKED FOR SOME TEAMS. BUT. THE STROUD INCIDENT SAYING SOMEONE THAT DOES NOT TEST WELL HE CAN CLEARLY HAVE A GOOD YEAR LIKE HE DID >> HE DEFINITELY DID. >>> IN THE LAST COUPLE OF MINUTES, ONE OF THE BIGGEST CITIES IN THE COUNTRY FORMALLY >> ALL RIGHT. >> LOVE THIS. >>> SO, IN THE LAST COUPLE MINUTES TONIGHT, THE SAN FRANCISCO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS VOTED TO FORMALLY A APOLOGIZE TO THE BLACK RESIDENTS AND THEIR DESCENDANTS FOR DECADES OF RACIST LAWS AND POLICIES BY THE CITY. LISTEN. >> THE NAMES ON THE ROSTER, THIS RESOLUTION IS APPROVED. SAME HOUSE, SAME CALL, THE RESOLUTION IS ADOPTED UNANIMOUSLY. >> SAN FRANCISCO IS NOW ONE OF THE FIRST BIG CITIES TO DO THIS. THEY ARE CONSIDERING PROVIDING REPARATIONS. WHILE SOME SAY IT SAY MAJOR STEP OTHERS ARGUE AN APOLOGY ALONE IS SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH. WE HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THIS STORY, JOINING US NOW, TALK US THROUGH THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE APOLOGY AND CRITICISMS WHAT IS NEXT. >> Reporter: THIS APOLOGY IS THE FIRST STEP AFTER ABOUT 100 PROPOSALS IN SAN FRANCISCO AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE ARE CELEBRATING AS A GREAT FIRST STEP. THERE IS A LOT OF PUSH BACK FROM THE BLACK COMPLEUN NIT SAN FRANCISCO. 46,000 PEOPLE IN THAT POPULATION, FIRST I WANT YOU TO HEAR SOME OF THE REACTION FROM ONE OF THE SUPERVISORS AS THE VOTE JUST PASSED. >> WE HAVE MUCH MORE WORK TO DO AND THIS IS A FIRST STEP. >> SO, SAN FRANCISCO IS APOLOGIZING AND MAKING A PROMISE AND A COMMITMENT TO NEVER REPEAT THE RACIST LAWS AGAIN WHILE WORKING TOWARDS SOLVING AND IMPROVING STEMMATIC RACISM. THE CRITICISM IS COMING FROM SOME IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY SAYING IT IS COTTON CANDY RHETORIC AND THEY PROPOSED AND HAVE OVER THE LAST YEAR PROPOSED ALTERNATE REPARATIONS AS THEY PROPOSED EVERY ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A $5,000 LUMP SUM CASH PAYMENT. THERE IS PUSH BACK FROM THE\\nMAYOR OF SAN FRANCISCO THE MAYOR OF SAN FRANCISCO, WHO THE MAYOR OF SAN FRANCISCO, WHO HERSELF IS BLACK. SHE BELIEVES THAT SHOULD BE HANDLED AT A NATIONAL LEVEL. ALSO BECAUSE OF A BUDGET CRUNC , $4 MILLION IN THEIR BUDGET THEY HAD PUT TOGETHER. THIS VOTE JUST HAPPENED. WE WILL SEE MORE REACTION COMING IN. BROADLY, THE CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATURE -- IT WOULD KIND OF TACKLE SOME PROPERTY ISSUES. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD THAT IS IT FOR THIS AREA. WE GOT MORE COVERAGE PICKING UP\\nRIGHT NOW. RIGHT NOW. SAW MATT -- \\u266a \\u266a >>> TONIGHT, A REAL RISK FOR DANGEROUS, MAYBE EVEN DEADLY WEATHER FOR MILLIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. A DOZEN FEET OF SNOW PREDICTED FOR ONE AREA WITH TORNADOES AND HAIL HEADING FOR ANOTHER. WE WALK YOU THROUGH ALL OF THAT FOR JUST A SECOND. IN MICHIGAN WHERE POLLS ARE SET TO BEGIN IN JUST A COUPLE OF HOURS. THE PROCESS VOTE IN THE WAR IN GAZA. IT COULD BE TROUBLE AHEAD FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN. WHEN VOTERS ARE SAYING ABOUT WHERE THIS GOES IN NOVEMBER. >>> MORE DRAMATIC TESTIMONY IN GEORGIA. THE TIMELINE OF WHEN THE D.A. STARTED DATING THE PROSECUTOR SHE PICKED TO HELP LEAD THE CASE AGAINST FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. WHAT A KEY WITNESS IS NOW SANK IN COURT. >>> WHY ISRAEL AND HAMAS ARE PUMPING THE BRAKES. THE CEASE- FIRE COULD COME IN LESS THAN A WEEK. -- GOOGLE IS TRYING TO FIX. WHEN IT MAY BE READY TO BE USED AGAIN. HEY THERE, I AM HAILLE. WE ARE ON HIGH ALERT FOR INTENSE WEATHER ACROSS THE MIDWEST. SEVERAL STATES UNDER AN ACTIVE TORNADO WATCH AS WE SPEAK. THIS IS NEW COMING IN THE LAST 60 MINUTES. THIS IS ALL PART OF THE WEATHER WHIPLASH WE'VE BEEN TELLING YOU ABOUT. IN TEXAS, YOU CAN SEE THE SMOKE IN THE SKY FROM FIRES BURNING THROUGH HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ACRES. IT IS NOT AT ALL CONTAINED. A DISASTER DECLARATION IN DOZENS OF COUNTIES ISSUED BY THE GOVERNOR LATE TONIGHT. IN NEW YORK, THESE ARE THE HAZY SKIES TODAY FROM WILDFIRE SMOKE DOWNTOWN. LOOK AT THAT, BARELY ANY VISIBILITY. IT CAUSED THE GROUND STOP. OUT WEST, WHAT COULD BE THE BIGGEST SNOWSTORM OF THE SEASON. 12 FEET OF SNOW FORECASTED FOR SOME SPOTS. FOR MORE THAN 12 MILLION PEOPLE, THE POTENTIAL OF HAIL, ATTENTIVE WIND, AND MAYBE EVEN TORNADOES. IT IS ESPECIALLY DANGEROUS GETTING CLOSE TO THOSE NIGHTTIME HOURS WHEN WE NOTE TWISTERS ARE DANGEROUS. THEY ARE NOT NORMAL FOR THIS TIME OF THE YEAR THIS FAR NORTH IN THE COUNTRY. LOOK, ALABAMA, MISSISSIPPI, THEY GET HUNDREDS. NOT THE CASE FOR ILLINOIS AND INDIANA. THAT IS WHY WE ARE KEEPING AN EYE ON THIS SO CLOSELY. THIS IS NOT NORMAL FOR THIS TIME OF THE YEAR. IT FEELS MORE LIKE SUMMER THAN WINTER. HIGHS IN A LOT OF PLACES, 5-30 DEGREES ABOVE AVERAGE. MORE THAN 100 RECORDS HAVE BEEN SAID IN THE LAST 24 HOURS. IN KANSAS, PEOPLE WERE LITERALLY OUT SHOPPING FOR FLOWERS IN THEIR GARDENS. DON'T PUT THE JACKETS AWAY TOO EARLY. TOMORROW MORNING, THE WHIPLASH. METEOROLOGIST BILL KARINS IS COVERING ALL OF THAT. THE POTENTIAL FOR THIS WEATHER TO WRAP UP ANY MINUTE NOW. IT HAS BEEN SO WARM. THE TEMPERATURES WILL DROP, AND THAT WILL CREATE A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY. >> WILL TALK TO YOU AN HOUR AGO. SINCE THEN, WE CAN TELL THE WIND IS PICKING UP. THE BIG CONCERN IN THESE EARLY EVENING HOURS, HAIL. THAT IS ACCORDING TO THE METEOROLOGIST  AT THE NATIONAL WEATHER CENTER. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HAIL THAT COULD BE THE SIZE OF A GOLF BALL. NOT ONLY ARE THEY TALKING ABOUT THIS HEAVY HAIL, WE COULD SEE THE TEMPERATURES DROPPED FROM 50-60 DEGREES. THAT IS OVER A 24 HOUR PERIOD. NOT ONLY DO YOU HAVE A THREAD OF HAIL, PLUMMETING TEMPERATURES, AND WITH THAT, WHEN THAT COLD FRONT MOVES IN, YOU SEE THE CREATION OF POSSIBLE TORNADOES HAPPENING OVERNIGHT. AS YOU SAID, HAILLE, THE ELEMENT OF DANGER INCREASES THERE. HOURS EARLIER, WE SAW PEOPLE OUT WALKING ALONG THE STREETS HERE IN DOWNTOWN CHICAGO. WE EVEN SAW PEOPLE SWIMMING AT THE LAKE. THEY WERE TAKING IT ALL IN, BUT THEY NO CHANGES COMING SOON. HAILLE? >> WE CAN SEE THAT WIND PICKING UP, EVEN WHERE YOU ARE. LET'S BRING IN METEOROLOGIST BILL KARINS . WE ARE SEEING THIS TORNADO WATCH. WHAT IS THE TIMING ON THAT? >> IT WILL BE ABOUT 7:00 TO ROUGHLY 10:00 P.M.. AND THEN ALONG OHIO RIVER AS WE GO THROUGHOUT THE OVERNIGHT HOURS. LET'S FIRST FOCUS ON THE AREA TO THE NORTH. THAT MEANS THEY NOW THINK THERE IS AT LEAST A CHANCE OF NOT JUST A TORNADO, BUT A STRONG TORNADO. THAT WOULD BE SOUTH OF CHICAGO. THEN YOU HAD THAT HUGE AREA WITH AT LEAST A CHANCE. WHY DO WE CARE ABOUT THAT? THEY ARE TYPICALLY MORE DEADLY. THAT IS WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO SPECIFY WHAT AREAS GET A CHANCE OF SEEING THAT. HERE IS THE FIRST TORNADO WATCH.\\nWE WANTED TO INCLUDE THE SOUTH WE WANTED TO INCLUDE THE SOUTH AREA. AND IF YOU NOTICE IN THE CORNER, YOU SEE A LOT OF THESE LITTLE RED DOTS POPPING UP. THESE ARE RAPIDLY DEVELOPING THUNDERSTORMS. NO WARNINGS WITH THESE YET, BUT JUST HOW QUICK THEY REALLY PROPPED UP. THESE HAVE BEEN POPPING IN EVENTUALLY HERE TOWARD THE CHICAGO AREA OVER THE NEXT COUPLE HOURS. AS FAR AS THE OHIO RIVER YEAR AREA, GO TO CINCINNATI, ALL THE BRIGHT RED HERE INTO WESTERN KENTUCKY. THESE ARE ALL POTENTIALLY STRONG THUNDERSTORMS. THEY LOOK LIKE THEY TYPICALLY PRODUCE THE LARGEST HAIL AND TORNADOES. IT WILL BE ALONG THAT LINE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. THE SEVERE WEATHER THREAT DIMINISHES, THEN A LOT OF SOAKING RAIN THROUGH THE REGION, INCLUDING WASHINGTON, ALONG WITH IT, GUSTY WINDS. ALREADY A DIFFICULT TRAVEL DAY AND AT THE AIRPORT. BY 6:00 P.M., THAT SQUALL LINE ALL THE WAY DOWN APPROACHING RALEIGH. AND IF YOU HAVE ANY FLIGHTS TOMORROW, A LOT OF DELAYS. ROCHESTER WITH 73 TODAY. ST. LOUIS AT 85 DEGREES. CHICAGO, JUST SHY OF YOUR RECORD AT 73. THE TWO BIGGEST ONES, HERE'S INTERSTATE 40. THAT IS ONE OF THE BIGGER BLAZES BURNING RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE A WARNING FOR THOSE BLAZES AS THEY CONTINUE. HOPEFULLY, WE WILL GET LUCKY. HOPEFULLY IT WILL MISS US AND NOT HIT. >> THANK YOU FOR KEEPING AN EYE ON ALL OF THAT. WE APPRECIATE IT. >>> WE ARE COUPLE OF HOURS AWAY FROM POLLS CLOSING THEIR. HOW VOTERS ARE FEELING. THIS COULD BE THE KEY SWINGS THEY COME NOVEMBER. SOME DEMOCRATS ARE STILL UPSET OVER HOW HE HANDLED HE ISRAEL- HAMAS WAR. LISTEN WHY SOME ARE VOTING UNCOMMITTED. MET WE VOTED UNCOMMITTED AGAIN TO PUT THAT PRESSURE ON THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION. SO WE CAN SEE PEACE. >> I'M HOPING THAT IT WILL TELL\\nTHE PARTY THAT THEY ARE MAKING THE PARTY THAT THEY ARE MAKING TERRIBLE DECISIONS. >> SO THERE IS A QUESTION ABOUT HOW MANY VOTERS WILL N FACT PICK UNCOMMITTED INSTEAD OF PRESIDENT BIDEN. ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE, FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP TRYING TO KEEP UP HIS WINNING STREAK. NEITHER OF THEM ARE EVEN BOTHERING TO TRAVEL TO MICHIGAN. I WANT TO GET INTO EMBASSY SHAQ BREWSTER . LISTEN, LET'S START ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE. THAT IS WHERE SOME OF THE SUSPENSE IS TONIGHT. IT WOULD NOT HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE OUTCOME OF THIS PRIMARY, RIGHT? HOW CONCERNED IS TEAM BIDEN ABOUT THIS ISSUE, RIGHT? IT SIGNALS A MESSAGE ABOUT DISPLEASURE WITH HIS HANDLING WITH THE WAR IN GAZA. HOW CONCERNED ABOUT THIS BEING A PROBLEM? >> YEAH, HAILLE. THIS COULD BE A SOURCE OF EMBARRASSMENT FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN. WHEN YOU TALK TO THE GROUPS THAT ARE TRYING TO ORGANIZE PEOPLE TO VOTE UNCOMMITTED, THEY SAY THEY ARE TRYING TO GET TO ABOUT 10,000 VOTERS TO VOTE UNCOMMITTED INSTEAD OF VOTING FOR JOE BIDEN. MANY OF THEM SAID THEY SUPPORTED JOE BIDEN BACK IN 2020. YOU ASKED ABOUT HOW CONCERN -- THEY HAVE BEEN POINTING TO SOME CONTEXT, WHICH IS IMPORTANT HERE. 10,000, THAT GOAL YOU ARE HEARING FROM THIS GROUP, IT IS ABOUT HOW MANY PEOPLE VOTED UNCOMMITTED IN PREVIOUS ELECTION CYCLES. AT LEAST THE PAST THREE ELECTION CYCLE. BACK IN THOSE, YOU HAD ABOUT 20,000 VOTERS SELECTING UNCOMMITTED. THAT WAS WITHOUT ANY BIG UNORGANIZED EFFORT. THEY ARE DEFINITELY PAYING ATTENTION TO THIS. YOU HAVE GROUPS SAYING THEY ARE TRYING TO SEND A CLEAR MESSAGE. PEOPLE WHO WERE WITH HIS BASE ARE NO LONGER WITH HIM. THEY WANT TO SEE A CHANGE OF POLICY FROM THE PRESIDENT. >> THERE IS ALSO SOME CLARITY FINALLY. I JUST WANT TO REMIND PEOPLE, WE EXPLAINED THIS DRAMA WITH THE GOP. MOST OF THEIR DELEGATES WILL GET ASIDE SATURDAY. THERE'S ACTUALLY TWO CONVECTION -- CONVICTIONS. WHO RUNS THE PARTY? DOES ANYBODY HAVE AN ANSWER? >> RIGHT. THE JUDGE SAYING THAT IT IS NOT THE PREVIOUS COMMITTEE CHAIR REPUBLICAN PARTY CHRISTINA KAMMERER WHO HAS BEEN TRYING TO HANG ONTO POWER DESPITE THE FACT SHE WAS VOTED OUT LAST MONTH. SHE WILL HAVE TO RELINQUISH CONTROL OVER THE GOP WEBSITE HERE. PLANNING TO HOST THE CONVENTION THIS WEEKEND. THERE IS ONE CHAIR, THE CHAIR THAT WAS ELECTED LAST MONTH. WHAT HAPPENS TONIGHT WITH PRIMARY, THAT WILL DETERMINE WHAT HAPPENS TO ABOUT 16 OF MICHIGAN'S 55 DELEGATES. THE REST WILL BE ALLOCATED AT THAT CONVENTION THAT WILL TAKE PLACE THIS WEEKEND. THERE WILL BE ONE CONVENTION WITH WHAT THE JUDGE IS SAYING. THE RIGHTFULLY APPOINTED CHAIR. THAT WILL BE TAKING PLACE HERE IN GRAND RAPIDS, HAILLE. >> SHAQ BREWSTER, LOT  TO FOLLOW THERE. THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US. >>> AWAY AND WE DON'T HEAR A LOT OF THESE DAYS  WHEN IT COMES TO CONGRESS GETTING STUFF DONE, OPTIMISM. HOW ABOUT THAT? THAT IS THE WORD FOR NOW. PRESIDENT BIDEN, LOOK AT THIS. ALONGSIDE THE TOP FOUR LEADERS FOR WHAT ONE OF THOSE CALLS AN INTENSE MEETING. THEY ALL SEEM TO AGREE. NOBODY WANTS HIS PARTIAL GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN THE COULD START AT MIDNIGHT ON FRIDAY. >> THIS WOULD DAMAGE THE ECONOMY SIGNIFICANTLY. WE NEED A BIPARTISAN SOLUTION. >> OKAY, SO WHAT HAPPENS IF THE GOVERNMENT DOES SHUTDOWN ON SATURDAY ESSENTIALLY AS OF THE STROKE OF MIDNIGHT? THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY, TRANSPORTATION. THEY WOULD POTENTIALLY COME UP THERE MARCH 8th. WORKERS AND THOUSANDS OF OTHERS FOR -- THEY ALL WON'T GET PAID. BUT SOME WILL STILL HAVE TO COME TO WORK. CHUCK SCHUMER SAYS THINGS GOT, IN HIS WORDS, FEISTY, WIN MONEY FOR UKRAINE CAME UP WITH HOUSE SPEAKER MIKE JOHNSON. >> THE MEETING WITH UKRAINE WAS ONE OF THE MOST INTENSE I'VE EVER ENCOUNTERED IN MY MANY MEETINGS IN THE OVAL OFFICE. >> INTENSE, HE SAYS. WE WILL GET IN THAT IN JUST A SECOND. WE WILL START IN JUST A SECOND\\nHERE. HERE. I REMEMBER A TIME THAT IS MAYBE NOT OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER A TIME. GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWNS WERE BAD POLITICS, RIGHT? THAT WAS A REAL CONCERN FOR LEADERS IN OFFICE. WE ARE ENTERING AN ERA WHERE WE'VE SEEN A BUNCH OF THIS. TALK US THROUGH THE THINKING FROM THE WHITE HOUSE ON THIS. ULTIMATELY, IT IS AN ACT OF CONGRESS. CONGRESS HAS TO DO IT. IT IS REALLY NOT US. >> EXACTLY, HAILLE. WE'VE GOTTEN WAY TOO USED TO THIS. THIS OPTIMISM, THE AGENCIES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT WOULD HAPPEN. THEY WOULD HAVE TO PREPARE FOR THIS ACTUALLY TAKING PLACE. THEY SENT OUT ALL OF THOSE GUIDANCE LAST WEEK. GIVING A HEADS UP. HEY, THIS ACTUALLY MIGHT HAPPEN. YOU NEED TO BE READY IN CASE. HERE'S WHAT OUR PLAN WOULD BE. WE KNOW SOME OF THE AGENCIES THAT WILL BE AFFECTED IN THE INITIAL ROUND OF THE SHUTDOWN AT THE END OF THIS WEEK. THEY REALLY DO HAVE REAL-WORLD IMPLICATIONS FOR PEOPLE IN TERMS OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS, LIKE THE HOUSING AUTHORITY, THE HOUSING SUBSIDIES FOR LOW INCOME HOUSING. ALSO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION, SOMETHING WE COVER A TON OF IN YOUR SHOW. THE AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS THAT HAVE BEEN A RESULT OF THIS GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN. THERE ARE ALSO SERIOUS IMPLICATIONS FOR THINGS LIKE VETERAN AFFAIRS, THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE. AGAIN, THAT IS JUST PART ONE OF THIS. IF THERE IS AN AN AGREEMENT BEYOND THAT, THERE COULD BE A FULL GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN. WE DO REMEMBER THOSE HAVE A LOT OF PINPOINTS. THERE ARE MILLIONS AFFECTED BY THAT, HAILLE. >> TOTALLY SEPARATE COME MONICA. RIGHT? ON UKRAINE, THAT ALSO CAME UP IN THIS MEETING. WHAT IS INTERESTING, THE VERY DIVERGENT OPINIONS OF PEOPLE INSIDE THAT ROOM AS IT RELATES TO WHETHER OR NOT THE U.S. SHOULD SEND MORE MONEY OVER TO UKRAINE TO HELP AFTER RUSSIA INVADED TWO YEARS AGO. SO WHY DID THINGS GET SO, QUOTE, UNQUOTE, INTENSE? AS CHUCK SCHUMER PUT IT. MET FOR A LONG TIME, THERE HAS BEEN BIPARTISAN SUPPORT OF SENDING MORE MILITARY AID TO UKRAINE. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE PRESIDENT THOUGHT, HEY, IF I LUMPED THIS TOGETHER WITH OTHER PRIORITIES, A.K.A., ANOTHER GOVERNMENT FUNDING REQUEST, WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET ACROSS THE FINISH LINE. THERE HAS BEEN SUCH A DEEP DIVISION WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. THIS IS INCLUDING HOUSE SPEAKER MIKE JOHNSON. THIS IS BEEN A REAL, REAL ISSUE. IF YOU DO NOT PROVIDE THE FUNDING FOR UKRAINE, IT WILL LOSE THE WAR AGAINST RUSSIA. THERE ARE CERTAIN AIR DEFENSE CAPABILITIES, EMMA WAS RUNNING SO LOW. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT WEEKS HERE, AND NOT MONTHS THAT COULD HAPPEN. THEY ARE HOPING THEY HAVE TO GET OVER THIS GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH THAT REQUEST MAY BE AS EARLY AS NEXT WEEK, HAILLE. ALL OF THIS HAPPENING IN A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION YEAR. MONICA ALBA, THANK YOU SO MUCH. >>> TO JORDAN -- GEORGIA NOW. THAT ELECTION INTERFERENCE CASE AGAINST DONALD TRUMP. WHEN EXACT WAY THAT THE FULTON COUNTY D.A. START DATING THE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR SHE PICKED TO LEAD THIS CASE? LOOKING FOR SOME ANSWERS, THE JUDGE IS CALLING BACK TERRENCE BRADLEY TO THE STAND. HE IS THE X DIVORCE ATTORNEY FOR NATHAN WADE. THE LAWYER FOR MR. TERMS CO- DEFENDANT WAS ASKING QUESTIONS FOR HOURS AND HOURS TO FILL IN THE TIMELINE. WHEN DID THEY START DATING? >> THERE WASN'T SOMETHING I COULD ATTRIBUTE TO HIM TELLING ME WHATEVER. AT THIS TIME, I'M TELLING YOU THAT I DO NOT HAVE THE DATE. >> REMEMBER WHY THIS MATTERS. THE JUDGE COULD PICK THE D.A. FANI WILLIS  OFF THIS CASE. SHE MAY HAVE HAD BENEFITED FINANCIALLY FROM THIS. THEY SAID IT IS ALL ABOUT THE TIMELINE. WILLIS AND WADE SAID THEY STARTED DATING IN 2022 AFTER SHE HIRED HIM. ONE OF HIS FORMER FRIENDS SAID,\\nOH NO, THE RELATIONSHIP STARTED OH NO, THE RELATIONSHIP STARTED YEARS BEFORE BACK IN 2019. THE REASON WHY THIS IS A BIG DEAL IS BECAUSE OF THIS QUESTION OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST, RIGHT CLICK THIS MEANS ESSENTIALLY THE CASE COULD FALL APART. WHAT DOES THE JUDGE NEED TO HEAR TO TRIGGER A RULING ONE WAY OR THE OTHER? >> THE LAW IN ORDER TO DISQUALIFY A PROSECUTOR, THERE HAS TO BE THE EXISTENCE OF AN ACTUAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST. THAT'S BEEN DEFINED AS A PROSECUTOR HAVING A FINANCIAL INTEREST IN THE CONVICTION OF A DEFENDANT. IF YOU WERE TO KEEP WITHIN THE GUARDRAILS OF THAT, YOU WOULD SAY, WHERE SO FAR, WE HAVEN'T HEARD ANY EVIDENCE. AND THEN FROM THE BOYFRIEND NATHAN WADE. SO FAR, THE TWO OF THEM BROKE UP. THIS WAS IN JUNE OF 2023. IT IS NOT LIKE SHE IS STILL DATING HIM AND HE IS STILL LEARNING MONEY ON THIS CASE OR SHE IS RECEIVING BENEFITS. AT SOME POINT IN TIME, THIS CASE TOOK A DETOUR. IS THERE PERJURY BEING COMMITTED? HAVE THEY LIED TO THE COURT WHEN THEY SAID THEIR RELATIONSHIP AGAIN AFTER NATHAN WADE WAS APPOINTED SPECIAL PROSECUTOR? IN ORDER TO FURTHER EXPLORE THAT, THE JUDGE ALLOWED THE FORMER DIVORCE LAWYER TO TAKE THE STAND FOR THE SECOND TIME IN ORDER TO TESTIFY AFTER THAT PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NATHAN WADE, HIS FORMER CLIENT, AND FANI WILLIS. WE WEREN'T SURE IF WE WOULD HEAR FROM THEM. >> YEAH. >> IT DIDN'T EXIST. INSTEAD, WHAT MR. BRADLEY HAD TO SAY, I HAVE NO PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE. THE WAY THAT I HAVE INTERPRETED IT, HAILLE, YET HE HAS NO EVIDENCE AS TO WHEN THAT RELATIONSHIP STARTED. >> WOULD -- WHEN WOULD WE KNOW ONE WAY OR THE OTHER? WHAT DO WE THINK? >> THIS COMING FRIDAY IN JUST TWO DAYS, MAYBE THREE DAYS, WE WILL HAVE THE CLOSING ARGUMENT . AND PROBABLY WITHIN 7-10 DAYS, WE SHOULD HAVE A WRITTEN ORDER. >> IT IS ONLY UP TO THE JUDGE. THERE IS NO JURY, JUST THE JUDGE. >> JUST THE JUDGE. IF THE CASE DOES GET DISQUALIFIED, THE ENTIRE OFFICE IS OFF THIS CASE. ANOTHER D.A.S OFFICE WOULD BE APPOINTED. THAT IS THE BIG QUESTION, WITH THE OFFICE CONTINUE TO PURSUE ALL THE CHARGES? >> KATIE, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING THERE AND BRICK AND THAT ALL DOWN. WE APPRECIATE IT. >>> A NEW BILL HAS BEGAN WORKING ITS WAY THROUGH THE\\nLEGISLATURE THAT WOULD PROTECT LEGISLATURE THAT WOULD PROTECT IVF IN THAT STATE. SEEMS LIKE THINGS HAVE BEEN HAPPENING AT LIGHTNING SPEED BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN. THIS ISSUE WASN'T EVEN ON THE RADAR LIKE A WEEK AGO. THE COURT RULING WAS ON FEBRUARY 16th. THE FIRST CLINICS -- TWO MORE FOLLOWED. THEY CAME UP WITH A BILL TO PROTECT IVF. OVER THE BEGIN, SAYING AN EXPLOSIVE DETONATED AT HIS OFFICE. LAW ENFORCEMENT'S ARE INVESTIGATING THAT. BOTH -- REPUBLICAN. THIS IS ALL HAPPENING IS THE BIDEN TOP OFFICIAL IS MEETING TODAY WITH FAMILIES AND DOCTORS IN ALABAMA WHO SAY THEIR LIVES AND PRACTICES HAVE BEEN THROWN INTO CHAOS BY THIS COURT RULING, AND HIGHLIGHTING THE SIGNIFICANCE IN REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS IN THE ELECTION YEAR. >> WE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WHAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO DO, TRYING TO BE SUPPORTIVE TO PEOPLE WHO WANT TO ACCESS THEIR ACCESS RIGHTS. WHEN ROE V. WADE WENT DOWN, TAKING AWAY ACCESS AND HEALTHCARE RIGHTS. IT DID IT TO MORE THAN JUST ABORTION CARE. >> KATHY PARK'S LIFE FOR US IN BIRMINGHAM AND JOINING US NOW. WHAT DO WE KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING? WE KNOW THERE HAS BEEN INTENSE PUSHBACK AFTER THE COURT RULING. INCLUDING FROM REPUBLICANS ON THE NATIONAL LEVEL. EVEN FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, WHO SAID WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING TO PROTECT IVF. WHAT DOES THE LANDSCAPE LOOK LIKE TO DO JUST THAT? >> Reporter: YEAH. YOU KIND OF PICK THROUGH EVERYTHING. THERE HAS CERTAINLY BEEN A LOT OF MOVEMENT TODAY. IT IS NO EXCEPTION. ALABAMA REPUBLICANS ACTUALLY PRESENTED TWO PIECES OF LEGISLATION. AND PROTECTING PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS FROM ANY CIVIL OR CRIMINAL PENALTIES. AND LAST WEEK, PRESENTING A SIMILAR PIECE OF LEGISLATION. THE GOVERNOR OF ALABAMA SEEMS TO SUGGEST THAT SHE WILL GET A BILL RELATIVELY SOON. POTENTIALLY IN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS. I WILL BE WATCHING THAT CLOSELY. IN THE MEANTIME, HAILLE, THINGS ARE STILL VERY MUCH IN LIMBO FOR THE IVF PATIENTS. YOU HEARD THE SECRETARY THERE HERE AT BIRMINGHAM A FEW HOURS AGO. AT A ROUNDTABLE WITH IVF PATIENTS, AS WELL AS THEIR PROVIDERS. HEARING SOME GUN WRENCHING -- GUT WRENCHING STORIES. THEY CAME DOWN FEBRUARY 16th. JUST A MOMENT AGO, WE SPOKE WITH HANNAH. SHE WAS TELLING US HOW DIFFICULT THE IVF PROCESS HAS BEEN FOR HER. TAKE A LISTEN. >> WE, MORE THAN ANYONE, KNOW THAT AN EMBRYO DOESN'T EQUAL A CHILD. IF IT DID, WE WOULD BE PREGNANT. >> [ CRYING ] >> WE WANTED IT DESPERATELY TO BE A CHILD. IT NEVER WILL BE. >> Reporter: HAILLE, THE FALLOUT HAS BEEN FLIPPED HERE. YOU HAVE AT LEAST THREE FERTILITY CLINICS THAT HAVE CAUSED TREATMENTS, AND IN AT LEAST TWO EMBRYO SHIPPING FACILITIES THAT HAS PAUSED HERE. A LOT OF QUESTIONS THAT ARE\\nBEING RAISED, ALONG WITH HER BEING RAISED, ALONG WITH HER INSURANCE -- HUNDREDS. IN MONTGOMERY, ALABAMA, HOLDING A RALLY.\\nTHEY SAY WHAT THEY HAVE A DAY THEY SAY WHAT THEY HAVE A DAY OF URGENCY. IT WOULD JUST BE AN INTERESTING DAY TOMORROW. WE WILL LIKELY SEE SOME FIREWORKS AMONG THESE PATIENTS. >> NO KIDDING. I'M GLAD HE WILL BE THERE. MORE REPORTING ON THAT IN THE HOURS AND DAYS TO COME. >>> OVERSEAS WITH HAMAS AND ISRAEL TONIGHT,  BOTH POURING COLD WATER ON THOSE SURPRISE COMMENTS FROM PRESIDENT BIDEN. THE PRESIDENT SAID WHILE HOLDING AN ICE CREAM CONE IN NEW YORK. 24 HOURS, DOESN'T SEEM LIKE ISRAEL IS ON THE SAME PAGE. THEY SAY THEY DIDN'T KNOW THE PRESIDENT WAS GOING TO SAY THAT IN THE FIRST RACE. HAMAS, GIVEN THE SAME MESSAGE HERE, TOO. LET'S BRING IN RAF SANCHEZ. SO WHAT'S UP WITH THIS WHIPLASH? THE PRESIDENT CAME OUT IN THIS VERY CASUAL SAYING, YEAH, I'M HOPEFUL. THEN HE IS, OVERSEAS. BOTH SIDES WERE PRETTY DISMISSIVE PRETTY QUICK. WHERE DO THINGS STAND? >> Reporter: HAILLE, ISRAEL AND HAMAS DON'T AGREE ON VERY MUCH. THEY DO SEEM TO BE ON THE SAME PAGE WITH THIS MONDAY DEADLINE. ISRAELI OFFICIALS ARE SAYING THEY WERE SURPRISED THEY DID NOT GET ANY HEADS UP FROM THE WHITE HOUSE THAT THIS WAS A DEADLINE, A GOAL, AND ASPIRATION THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN WAS GOING TO BE SETTING. WE DID HEAR A STATEMENT FROM PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU  TONIGHT. HE MADE NO MENTION OF A DEAL. INSTEAD, HE SAYS HE BELIEVES HE HAS ENOUGH AMERICAN SUPPORT TO CONTINUE HIS CAMPAIGN INSIDE OF GAZA. FROM HAMAS' PERSPECTIVE, THEY HAVE BEEN CALLING HIM A POLITICAL HYPOCRITE FOR SAYING THAT HE WANTS TO SEE A CEASE FIRE, AT THE SAME TIME, SUPPLYING MORE WEAPONS TO ISRAEL. ANY TALK OF DEAL IS PREMATURE. WHAT WE KNOW, NEGOTIATIONS AT THIS POINT ARE FOCUSED ON A PROPOSAL LAID OUT BY BILL BURNS. IT INVOLVES A PAUSE IN THE FIGHTING FOR UP TO SIX WEEKS. HAMAS HAS RELEASED AROUND 40 HOSTAGES, INCLUDING THOSE WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO COME OUT IN THE LAST DEAL. ISRAEL IS EXPECTED TO RELEASE HUNDREDS OF PALESTINIAN PRISONERS, INCLUDING SOME WHO WERE SERVING LONG JAIL SENTENCES FOR OTHER SERIOUS OFFENSES. BOTH SIDES ARE SAYING THERE IS MAJOR STILL OUTSTANDING. WHAT EXACTLY IS THE RATIO OF PRISONERS TO HOSTAGES? AND IF THEY WILL WITHDRAW FROM PALESTINIAN CITIES INSIDE OF GAZA. HAMAS SAYS THEY WANT THEM OUT OF THE STRIP ALTOGETHER. HAILLE? >> PRESS IN TEL AVIV. THANK YOU. LOTS MORE TO GET HERE TO. >>> APPLE APPARENTLY ABANDONING A DECADE-LONG PROJECT. PLUS, EVEN MORE MUSIC IS DISAPPEARING FROM TIKTOK TONIGHT. WE WILL EXPLAIN.\\n\\u266a \\u266a >> THE COUNTDOWN HAS BEGUN. >> NBC NEWS NOW. >> GET READY. THIS COULD BE THE REALITY HEADING TO YOUR LOCAL WENDY'S. SEARCH PRICING, JUST LIKE UBER, EXCEPT AT THE DRIVE THROUGH. THEY WILL CHANGE UP HOW MUCH THEY CHARGE FOR CERTAIN THINGS BASED ON HOW POPULAR THEY ARE, TIME OF THE DAY, EVEN THE WEATHER. THEY WILL USE AI TO FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH YOUR FOOD WILL CAUSE AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT. CALEB SILVER IS JOINING US NOW. THEY ARE CALLING THIS SUGGESTIVE SELLING. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS, DO YOU? >> I THINK IT MEANS THEY WILL UPSELL WHENEVER THEY CAN. SURGING THE PRICES OF PRODUCTS IN DEMAND. IN FAST FOOD, THERE ARE OTHER CHOICES. WENDY'S IS JUST FOLLOWING SUIT WITH OTHER COUNTRIES THAT ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHEN THEY CAN UPSELL ITEMS, RAISE THE PRICE ON THINGS, AND ALSO LOWER THE PRICES ON THINGS THAT AREN'T SELLING WELL. WE WILL HAVE TO GET USED TO IT IN THE FAST FOOD INDUSTRY. THIS IS AN EXPERIMENT THEY INTEND TO BRING OUT IN 2025. IF IT WORKS, YOU CAN EXPECT OTHERS TO FOLLOW SUIT. >> CAN WE? I WONDER ABOUT THE POTENTIAL SHOPPER BACKLASH TO THIS. FOLKS HAVE A LOT OF CHOICES. >> THEY DO. IF YOU ARE A BACON EATER FAN OR FROSTY FAN, YOU WILL STICK WITH THIS. THE ONE THING TO CONSIDER, WENDY'S RELIES ON ITS\\nFRANCHISES. FRANCHISES. IT'S GOT ABOUT 60,000, ABOUT 80% OF THOSE ARE OWNED BY FRANCHISES, SMALL BUSINESSES. FOOD PRICES IN GENERAL HAVE BEEN VERY HIGH. IT HAS GONE UP ABOUT 20% SINCE PER PANDEMIC. YOU ARE RIGHT. IN THE FAST FOOD INDUSTRY, THOSE CHOICES ARE ABOUT 20-30 FEET AWAY. >> TALK ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE IN PRICING . ARE WE SAYING IT COULD GO LIKELY AVERAGE PRICE? WOULD WE SEE A SEVEN DOLLARS FROSTY, OR A $.10 FROSTY? HOW MUCH IS THE SWING? WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR WHAT I'M SPENDING? >> IT DEPENDS ON THE TIME OF DAY. WITH THE LUNCH TIME CROWD, YOU CAN SEE THE PRICES SURGE. THEY HAVEN'T BEEN VERY SPECIFIC ABOUT IT. THE WHOLE POINT IS TO USE AI FOR DIGITAL MENUS. WENDY'S IS TRYING TO GET INTO THIS, AS WELL, SO THEY CAN MANAGE THEIR INVENTORY BETTER, UPSELL THINGS THAT ARE SELLING WELL. FOLKS THAT ARE EATING AT WENDY'S, THEY ARE ON A BUDGET. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT. WE WILL SEE. >>> GOOGLE SAYS IT WILL RELAUNCH IT AI IMAGE GENERATOR. LOOK AT THIS. HERE IS HOW IT ANSWERED PROMPTS. GEMINI'S RESPONSES TO THE PROMPT, WHO HAS DONE MORE HARM QUICK GEMINI RESPONDED, IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY DEFINITIVELY WHICH HAS DONE MORE HARM. GOOGLE IS ALREADY APOLOGIZING, SAYING THEY MISSED THE MARK ON THIS. >> SO THEY ARE GOING TO RELAUNCH IT. TALK ABOUT WHAT THIS HAS CAUSED THE GOOGLE, THIS CONTROVERSY. >> THESE ARE IMAGE RESPONSES. THEY WENT VIRAL PRETTY QUICKLY ON SOCIAL MEDIA, KIND OF SPIRALING A DEBATE ONLINE. CALLING GEMINI SUPER RACIST AND SEXIST. OTHERS ARE ACCUSING THEM OF BEING TOO WOKE. YOU HAVE VIVEK RAMASWAMY, THE FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE AMONG THOSE. HE SAYS IT REFLECTS SOME OF THE BIASES OF ITS CREATORS AND CERTAIN IDEOLOGIES. HE MAKES THE POINT THAT IT REFLECTS THE CULTURAL ORTHODOX IN SILICONE VALLEY. IT IS COSTING GOOGLE BILLIONS. YESTERDAY, IT WAS DOWN 4%. IT MAY NOT SOUND LIKE A LOT. IN DOLLARS FOR A 4% DROP, IT IS ABOUT 60 BILLION IN DOLLARS JUST WIPED OUT. IT IS A BIG NUMBER. IT'S BEEN A TOUGH WEEK FOR THIS COMPANY. SUBMIT WE'VE SEEN THAT IN THE PAST. THAT IS IN THE CROSSHAIRS OF THE CULTURE WARS. >> ABSOLUTELY. ABSOLUTELY. ESPECIALLY FOR SILICONE VALLEY. THEY DON'T WANT TO GET CAUGHT UP IN THIS DISCUSSION. AI TALENT AND ENGINEERING TALENT IS SO HARD TO COME BY RIGHT NOW. THEY ARE HAVING TROUBLE RECRUITING PEOPLE. THEY DID DISABLE THE TOOL. THEY ARE SAYING, WE MISSED THE MARK. IT IS INACCURATE. IT DOES COME TO QUESTION HOW THIS HAPPENED? THEY ARE TRYING TO BE COMPETING AS A LEADER HERE. THIS COULD MAKE IT HARDER IN THE LONG RUN. ABSOLUTELY ITSELF WE CARE FOR GOOGLE, HAILLE. >>> TO THE FIVE THINGS OUR TEAM THINKS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT TONIGHT. >>> NUMBER ONE, A JURY CONVICTED OF MURDER IN THE DEATH OF JAM MASTER JAY. THEY KILLED HIM OUT OF REVENGE FOR A DRUG DEAL. THE DEFENDANT HAS PLEADED NOT GUILTY. HE WILL HAVE A SEPARATE TRIAL. >>> NUMBER TWO, APPLE IS WRAPPING ITS PROJECT TO MAKE AN ELECTRIC CAR. IT IS SOMETHING THEY HAVE WORKED ON FOR LIKE A DECADE. A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WORKED ON THIS WILL REPORTEDLY MOVED TO GENERATIVE AI. NUMBER THREE, THE ARMY IS DOWNSIZING, CUTTING 24,000 JOBS. SOUNDS LIKE A LOT, BUT IT IS ABOUT 5%. IT IS RESTRUCTURING TO GET READY FOR THE NEXT BIG WAR MOVING AWAY FROM COUNTERTERRORISM AND WORKING ON THINGS LIKE AIR DEFENSE. >>> TIKTOK IS REMOVING MORE SONGS. REMEMBER, THEY REPRESENT ARTISTS LIKE TAYLOR SWIFT, ARIANA GRANDE A. TIKTOK SAYS THEY ARE BEING GREEDY. >>> NUMBER FIVE, LISTEN TO THIS, $3.7 MILLION AT AN OPTION. 48 PACKS OF CARDS FROM THE 1980s SEASON. THE ROOKIE CARD MAY BE IN THAT BOX. THAT WOULD BE A HUGE DEAL, BUT >> FROM ISRAEL, FROM FLORIDA.\\n\\u266a \\u266a \\u266a \\u266a >>> TONIGHT, A RARE RIDE ALONG. ECUADOR, THE COUNTRY UNDER A STATE OF EMERGENCY FROM AN EXPLOSION OF VIOLENCE THAT INCLUDED GANG MEMBERS. THE GROUP OF ARMED MEN ATTACKING THE NEW STATION ON LIVE TV. WE TOLD YOU ABOUT IT LAST MONTH.

NOT ANYMORE. >> Reporter: THE GANGS HAVE\\nBEEN RECATEGORIZED AS BEEN RECATEGORIZED AS TERRORISTS.\\nFORCING THEIR WAY INSIDE. FOR SOME, IT IS CLEARLY FOR SOME, IT IS CLEARLY TERRIFYING.

THEY'VE DONE NOTHING WRONG. >> OF THESE PEOPLE ARE VERY UNHAPPY.\\nTHEY WILL LOOK FOR GANG MEMBERS THEY WILL LOOK FOR GANG MEMBERS WHEREVER THEY WANT TO. >> Reporter: OUTSIDE, YOUNG MEN ARE HELD WITH THEIR HANDS ABOVE THEIR HEADS WHILE THE SEARCHES IN QUESTION. THEIR FAMILIES STARTED SHOUTING. IT IS TENSE, AND THE POLICE ARE UNCOMPROMISED. >> THEY ARE MY CHILDREN. THEY ARE FAMILY, ALL OF THEM. THEY ARE GOOD, HARD-WORKING PEOPLE. THERE IS NOTHING HERE. >> Reporter: THE COMMANDING OFFICER BELIEVES THESE OPERATIONS ARE BRINGING ABOUT CHANGE. LOCAL OBJECTIONS, HE SAYS, ARE JUST PART OF THE PROCESS OF THE GANG POWER. SKY NEWS, ECUADOR. >> THANK YOU FOR THAT REPORTING. WE COVER HUNDREDS OF INTERNATIONAL STORIES EVERY DAY. BECAUSE IT CAN BE TOUGH TO READ, WATCH, LISTEN TO THE MALL, OUR TEAMS AROUND THE WORLD HAVE DONE IT FOR YOU. >>> OUT OF AUSTRALIA,  FINDING THE BODIES OF A COUPLE SHOT. THE SHOOTER WAS ALSO A POLICE OFFICER, ADMITTING TO KILLING THEM AND HIDING THEIR BODY UNDER DEBRIS. THEY'RE ASKING POLICE NOT TO MARCH AT THEIR ANNUAL PARADE THIS WEEKEND. >>> OUT OF  ITALY, A FAMILY IS BACK IN ROME TONIGHT AFTER BEING HELD FOR SOMETHING LIKE TWO YEARS.\\nTHE MILITARY GROUP AFFILIATED THE MILITARY GROUP AFFILIATED WITH AL QAEDA KIDNAPPED THEM. STORMING OUT OF NEW ZEALAND, THE COMPANY -- COUNTRY SAYS IT IS OFFICIALLY SCRATCHING WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE TOUGHEST TOBACCO LAW IN THE WORLD. IT WOULD HAVE STOPPED TWO BORN IN 2009 OR LATER FROM BUYING TOBACCO PRODUCTS. >> SOME OF THOSE VERY ANGRY PARENTS AND KIDS DRESSED AS BALLOON PLUS -- >>> SKIPPING ONE OF THE TESTS >> EVERY NIGHT, YOUR NEWS PLAYLIST. TOP STORY WITH TOM LLAMAS, STREAMING WEEKNIGHTS AT 7:00 ON NBC NEWS NOW. >>> WE KNOW THE SUPER BOWL JUST HAPPENED. THE NEXT SEASON IS BEING TALKED ABOUT NOW. WHY? BECAUSE OF THE NFL COMBINE. THERE IS ONE TOOL THEY DON'T WANT THEIR PLAYERS GRADED ON. TELLING PLAYERS, DO NOT TAKE THE COGNITIVE TEST. A BIG REASON, LACK OF TRUST. CJ STROUD HAS HIS GOURLEY LAST YEAR. IT HAD TEAMS DOUBTING THEIR INTELLIGENCE. HE STILL WON TOP OFFENSIVE ROOKIE, BECOMING MAYBE THE BIGGEST YOUNG STAR IN THE LEAGUE. THE NFL HAS DONE THIS INTELLIGENCE TEST FOR YEARS. THERE ARE ACCUSATIONS NOW THAT THEY HAVE A RACIAL BIAS, THESE TESTS. IS THIS NEW ONE SUPPOSED TO CUT THIS OUT? WE AGAIN HAVE ISSUES OF A BLACK ATHLETE AND ISSUES AND WHISPERS OF HOW SMART HE IS. >> Reporter: TELLS US THAT EXISTED IS ONE USED WIDELY. NOT JUST FOR FOOTBALL PLAYERS, BUT FOR COMPANIES TO EVALUATE THE COGNITIVE ABILITY. THE NEW TEST THAT IS BEING DISCUSSED LOOK FOR DIFFERENT THINGS THAT ARE MORE SPECIFIC PERHAPS WHEN YOU THINK OF WHAT FOOTBALL PLAYERS HAVE TO DO ON THE FIELD. IT WILL TEST THE PROCESSING SPEED, REACTION TIME, HOW THEY REACT UNDER STRESS. THEY ARE DIFFERENT, RIGHT? THE OLD ONE IS NOT REALLY BEING USED BY THE NFL. THERE ARE TWO THINGS BEING LOOKED AT. IT IS A SERIES OF QUESTIONS THAT HAVE TO BE ANSWERED. LOOKING AT MATH AND VOCABULARY. ACTUALLY USING TECHNOLOGY FOR PLAYERS TO KEEP TRACK OF OBJECTS. FOR A QUARTERBACK, IT CAN TEST THE ABILITY WHERE A QUARTERBACK AND LOOK AT AN OBJECT -- A FEW DIFFERENT OBJECTS. THAT IS SOMETHING THEY DO ON THE FIELD, RIGHT? THEY HAVE TO LOOK AT DIFFERENT PLAYERS, PLAYERS COMING AGAINST HIM AND WHO HE IS THROWING THE BALL TO. THAT IS ALSO WHY HALF THE TEAMS IN THE NFL ARE USING THAT TO EVALUATE THE QUARTERBACKS. THESE ARE TEAMS THAT INVEST A LOT OF MONEY WHEN THEY MAKE A DECISION AND DRAFT A PLAYER. THAT IS WHY THEY BROUGHT IN THE SECOND TEST AND WHY IT HAS BECOME SO POPULAR. >> OKAY. YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT USING IT FOR QUARTERBACKS, RIGHT? YOU GOT OTHERS. ONE AGENCY SAYING IT IS NOT RIGHT FOR A PLAYER'S MENTAL TO BE DISCUSSED BY THE PUBLIC. IT SEEMS LIKE TO THE AVERAGE PERSON GOING, WAIT A SECOND, WHAT IF MY TEST SCORES LEAK? CJ WAS STILL GOOD. HE WAS STILL NUMBER TWO IN LAST YEAR'S DRAFT AND STILL A GREAT PLAYER. >> Reporter: CORRECT, HAILLE. THE AGENCY ADVISING THE ATHLETES NOT TO TAKE THIS TEST BROUGHT THIS UP. WHAT HAPPENED TWO YEARS AGO, CJ STROUD TOOK THIS TEST. ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WAS THAT THE INFORMATION WAS LEAKED. THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE PRIVATE INFORMATION. THAT INFORMATION IS DELIVERED TO THE TEENS. AND THEN THAT OF COURSE AFFECTED THE PLAYER. FOR NOW, WE HAVE AGENTS ADVISING THE PLAYERS NOT TO TAKE THOSE COGNITIVE TESTS. THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER QUARTERBACKS LIKE BROCK PURDY, PATRICK HARMS -- PATRICK MAHOMES, JOE BURROW. THEY TESTED VERY WELL IN THE TEST. WE CAN GO ON THE SERVER AND SEE HOW EVERYONE SCORED. SOME INFORMATION HAS BEEN LEAKED. WE KNOW WHO DID WELL AND WHO DIDN'T. THERE IS AN ARGUMENT FOR THOSE WHO TESTED WELL AND IS DOING WELL IN THE LEAGUE. MOVING FORWARD, IT HAS WORKED FOR SOME TEAMS. THE CJ STROUD INCIDENT WILL ALSO HELP. IF SOMEONE DOESN'T TEST WELL, THEY CAN STILL HAVE A VERY GREAT YEAR LIKE HE DID. >> WE APPRECIATE THAT. >>> ONE OF THE BIGGEST CITIES IN THE COUNTRY  FORMALLY >> KRISTEN WALKER HOSTS MEET THE PRESS  EVERY SUNDAY ON NBC. >>> IN JUST THE LAST COUPLE OF MINUTES TONIGHT, THE SAN FRANCISCO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS HAS VOTED TO ONLY APOLOGIZE TO BLACK RESIDENTS FOR DECADES OF RACIST LAWS. MAKE YOU SEE THE NAMES ON THE ROSTER. THIS RESOLUTION IS APPROVED. THE RESOLUTION IS ABOUT THAT UNANIMOUSLY. >> SAN FRANCISCO IS NOW ONE OF THE FIRST BIG CITIES TO DO THIS.\\nTHEY ARE ALSO CONSIDERING THEY ARE ALSO CONSIDERING REPARATIONS. OUR LAURA BARRETT FOLLOWING THE STORY NOW. TALK YESTERDAY SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS APOLOGY. WHAT COMES NEXT? >> THIS IS THE FIRST STEP THAT COMES TO FRUITION AFTER MORE THAN 100 PUZZLES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE ARE CELEBRATING AS A GREAT FIRST STEP. THERE IS A LOT OF PUSHBACK FROM THE BLACK COMMUNITY. 46,000 PEOPLE IN THAT POPULATION. FIRST, THE REACTION AS THE VOTERS PASSED. >> WE HAVE MUCH MORE WORK TO DO. THIS IS MOST CERTAINLY AN IMPORTANT STEP. OVER 100 RECOMMENDATIONS MAY. >> SAN FRANCISCO WAS APOLOGIZING AND ALSO MAKING A PROMISE AND COMMITMENT TO NEVER REPEAT. ALSO WORKING TOWARD SOLVING AND IMPROVING CYST TO MAKE RACISM. COMING FROM SOMETHING IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY THAT THIS IS, QUOTE, COTTON CANDY RHETORIC. REPARATIONS THAT THE COMMITTEE -- RECEIVING A $5 MILLION LUMP SUM CASH PAYMENT. TO REMEDY SAN FRANCISCO'S, QUOTE, THE RACIAL WEALTH GAP. SHE BELIEVES THAT REPARATION SHOULD BE HANDLED AT A NATIONAL LEVEL. ACTUALLY BECAUSE OF A BUDGET CRUNCH, $4 MILLION IN THEIR REPLETION ADVISORY. WE WILL SEE MORE REACTION COMING IN. BROADLY, THE LAWMAKERS HAVE INTRODUCED ANOTHER REPARATION BILL THAT WILL TACKLE SOME PROPERTY ISSUES. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO FOLLOW. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Stock_indices\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
