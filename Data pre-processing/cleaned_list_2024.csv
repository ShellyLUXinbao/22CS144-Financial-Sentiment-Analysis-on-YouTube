0,YEoJq_PcOgc,What can reignite Apple shares?,CNBC Television,2024-02-28 17:55:38+00:00,"LATELY. WE ALSO HAVE NEW COMMITTEE MOVES TO DISCUSS. JOINING ME: JOE TERRANOVA, KARI FIRESTONE, JENNY HARRINGTON, STEVE WEISS. CHECK THE MARKETS TODAY. THE DOW DOWN S&P IS A FRACTIONAL LOSER NASDAQ IN THE RED AS WELL. WE ARE FOCUSED ON APPLE BECAUSE OF ALL THE TIME WE'VE DONE ABOUT THE MEGA CAPS AND THE AI TRADE, THIS, THAT AND THE OTHER THING. JOE, APPLE'S SIX-MONTH PERFORMANCE IS A NOTHING BURGER. IT'S UP 1.5%. I DON'T EXPECT ANYTHING TO HAPPEN AT THE SHAREHOLDERS' MEETING TODAY TO SEE A CATALYST FOR THAT. WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS STOCK >>. I THINK WHAT WE NEED IS, IN JUNE AT THE WWDC, TO HEAR ABOUT THE AI INNOVATION- AND YOU HAD A LITTLE BIT OF A GLIMPSE INTO IT YESTERDAY. AND WHY IS IT SO PARTICULARLY RELEVANT IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS? THE PERCEPTION OF THE MARKETPLACE IS THAT APPLE IS NOT INNOVATING QUICKLY ENOUGH IN THAT DIRECTION AND CERTAINLY HAS NOT LAID OUT WHAT THE STRATEGY AND THE PLAN IS FOR AI. IF YOU THINK BACK TO 2014,, OKAY, GO BACK TO 2014,. IN MAY OF 2014,, WE BEGAN TO HEAR THE RUMORS THAT APPLE WAS FINALLY GOING TO DELIVER SOMETHING SIMILAR TO THE ANDROID IN TERMS OF THE SIZE OF THE iPHONE INCREASING. SO WHAT DID WE GET? IN SEPTEMBER, YOU HAD THE ANNOUNCEMENT, WHERE YOU HAD THE iPHONE 6 PLUS, 5.5 INCHES. THAT WAS THE MOST SUCCESSFUL iPHONE EVER TO SELL, AND I WILL TELL YOU THIS AT WWDC IN JUNE. IF APPLE IS ABLE TO CONFIDENTLY COMMUNICATE TO ITS INVESTOR BASE HOW WE'RE GOING TO INCORPORATE AI INTO THE iPHONE 16, THE iPHONE 16 WILL SELL BEYOND THE iPHONE 6 PLUS AND IT WILL BE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT INNOVATION APPLE HAS INTRODUCED AND IT WILL ABSOLUTELY RESTART THE MOMENTUM IN THE STOCK. >>. YOU'RE TELLING KARI, WHO ALSO OWNS THE STOCK, A STOCK THAT'S BEEN DEAD MONEY FOR THE LAST SIX MONTHS IS GOING TO BE DEAD MONEY UNTIL THE SUMMER >> IN JUNE. THAT'S THE EARLIEST THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET THAT INFORMATION FROM APPLE, IF THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER ON INCORPORATING AI INTO THE iPHONE 16. >> JUNE, ISN'T THAT LONG. FROM HERE, BUTI WOULD SAY --: >> I GUESS, IF YOU WAITED SIX MONTHS, WHY NOT WAIT NINE? >> WELL, FOR NOW IT'S THREE. BUT BASICALLY, WE'VE HAD A YEAR FOR APPLE. IT WAS A VERY GOOD STOCK LAST YEAR. IT'S THE LARGEST CAP WE'RE UNDERWEIGHT THE NAME. >> IT WAS THE LARGEST CAP. NOW IT'S NOT. MICROSOFT IS, AND THAT SPEAKS TO WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. WHO EVER THOUGHT THAT WOULD HAPPEN? >> I DID: >> I DID: >> YOU THOUGHT THAT MICROSOFT WAS GOING TO GET A LARGER MARKET CAP THAN APPLE >>. I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE DID >> USED TO HAVE A LARGER MARKET CAP AND THEN IT LOST, IT BUTTHINGS CHANGE AND WITH THE CHANGE THE AI TRAIN. AND APPLE HAS NOT BEEN AS MUCH ON THAT CABOOSE LINE AS OTHER COMPANIES IN THAT TOP TIER. WHAT WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW CLEARLY IS THE FOUR THAT ARE. WHICH IS NVIDIA. MICROSOFT, AMAZON AND META HAVE MOVED THE MARKET SO FAR THIS YEAR. THEY REPRESENT 50% OF THE GAIN IN THE S&P. WE HAVE A CHART TO SHOW THAT AND YOU SEE, THE CONCENTRATION OF THE S&P IS THESE NAMES AND OF COURSE, NVIDIA IS NOW 30% OF THE S&P GAINS. HAVE REALLY DRIVEN IT APPLE -- DOES THAT MEAN IT WON'T BE, IT MIGHT BE? THEY HAVE TO PROVE THAT THEY CAN DO SOMETHING. THAT'S INNOVATIVE. RIGHT NOW IT'S A 30 MULTIPLE STOCK WITH HIGH SINGLE DIGIT EARNING GROWTH >>. WE USED TO SAY, JENNY, THAT THIS DISPELS. ONE THING WE USED TO SAY: AS APPLE GOES, SO GOES THE MARKET. WE ARE PROVING OURSELVES NOW THAT NOT ONLY CAN THE MARKET GO UP, THE NASDAQ CAN APPROACH AN ALL-TIMEHIGH WITHOUT PARTICIPATION FROM WHAT WAS ONCE THE LARGEST STOCK IN THE MARKET. THAT WAS DEBATED, THAT WAS QUESTIONED, THAT WAS DOUBTED FOR A GOOD PERIOD OF TIME. >>. RIGHT IT'S BECAUSE LEADERSHIP CHANGES. APPLE HAS BEEN FLAT FOR THREE YEARS- IT WAS FUNNY. I'VE BEEN ON THE SHOW ABOUT FIVE AND A HALF YEARS. THE FIRST TWO YEARS IT WAS ALL TESLA, THEN IT WAS ALL APPLE AND THEN APPLE HAS BEEN FADING IN FAVOR OF LIKE, ALL NVIDIA. THE POINT OF THAT: WE'VE SEEN LEADERSHIP CHANGE AND WE'VE SEEN IT CHANGE QUITE DRAMATICALLY EVEN OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS. KARI WAS SAYING JUST NOW: THEIR EARNINGS, GROWTH IS EXPECTED TO BE AT 7:00.. SCOTT, WHEN YOU SAY WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS STOCK, I THINK IT'S AN EASY ANSWER. WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE STOCK IS: OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS, THE KAGR HAS BEEN 2%. CAGR OF GROWTH HAS BEEN 5%. I DON'T THINK IT NEEDS TO BE THEM SAYING: OH, WE'RE GOING TO PUT AI IN THE NEXT iPHONE AND WE EXPECT SALES TO BE -- WHATEVER THE NUMBERS ARE, >> THE SALES WILL COME. >>. I DON'T THINK YOU'RE RIGHT. >> THAT'S THE THING WE TALK ABOUT SALES -- OF COURSE, THEY'RE GOING TO BE STRONG BECAUSE THEY HAVE SUCH A STRONG BASE. INSTALL BASE IS THE WORD I WAS THINKING OF. TO JENNY'S POINT AT 27 TIMES, GOOD IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH. >>. THE SALES HAVE TO BE HISTORIC AND I BELIEVE THEY COULD BE. >> ANALYSTS EXPECT 7% GROWTH FOR THE YEAR. AHEAD, THAT'S DRIVEN BY SHARE BUYBACK. RIGHT, EVEN, RIGHT. NOW, THERE'S JUST NOTHING IN THERE. THAT'S COMPELLING. SO I DON'T EVEN KNOW, JOE, HOW THEY WOULD GET --. >>. IT'S A LITTLE BIT OVER THE TOP FROM SOMEBODY WHO DOESN'T OWN THE STOCK? >> WELL, THERE'S A REASON. I DON'T OWN THE STOCK. >>. BUT THAT'S INSINUATING, THAT WELL, BY NOT OWNING IT FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS, YOU'VE DONE JUST GREAT. >> WELL, I WOULD SAY I'VE DONE JUST GREAT. WE'VE OWNED META, WE'VE OWNED UNITED --. OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS, APPLE HAS DONE NOTHING. I'M EXAGGERATING. >> A LITTLE BIT. >> 2021, APPLE WAS TRADING AT $180. >>. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT APPLE STOCK AS IF IT'S A BIG DOG IN THE MARKET FOR YEARS. >> IT'S A NOTHING, HAMBURGER. >>. I THINK WE'RE JUST MISSING THE POTENTIAL. -- >> NO, FOR TWO AND A HALF YEARS IT'S DONE NOTHING. >>. YOU'RE LOOKING IN THE PAST, I AGREE. -- >> I'M LOOKING FORWARD TOO. SHARE BUYBACKS. EH, CAN'T YOU DO BETTER? >>. YESTERDAY WAS A VERY SIGNIFICANT ANNOUNCEMENT AND FOR PEOPLE TO BELIEVE, APPLE HAS NOT BEEN WORKING ON INCORPORATING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE INTO THE iPHONE. THAT PREMISE IS JUST SO MISGUIDED. NOW THEY'RE PUSHING ALL THEIR CHIPS IN ONE DIRECTION AND ACKNOWLEDGING THE POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITY. IF YOU'RE ABLE TO INCORPORATE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE INTO THESE PHONES WHICH WE'RE ALL USING, THAT THIS IS THE MOST VALUABLE THING IN ESSENCE WE'RE CARRYING AROUND WITH US. THAT WILL BE A HISTORIC MOMENT. >> HEY SCOTT -- >> WEISS, PLEASE. I WAS TRYING TO COME TO YOU ANYWAY. >> YEAH, THANKS FOR COMING TO ME TO BE THE VOICE OF REASON AND SET THIS WILL DEBATE. >> HEY, WAIT, WHAT? >>. APPLE IS JUST A TIRED STOCK. I MEAN IT HAS ALWAYS LAGGED INNOVATION. YOU'VE PICKED ON ME FOR THAT BEFORE, BUT IT'S TRUE. THEY'VE BEEN, IN THE POST-STEVE JOBS ERA, A FOLLOWER INSTEAD OF A LEADER, AND THE MARKET IS JUST NOT WILLING TO PAY FOR THAT. ANYMORE, I DO THINK THE MULTIPLE COMPRESSES THE GROWTH. HASN'T BEEN THERE FOR YEARS. YOU KEEP WAITING FOR A PHONE REFRESH CYCLE AND THEY HAVE BEEN MORE AND MORE DEPRESSING. ALL THEY DO IS IMPROVE THE ZOOM FEATURE ON THE CAMERA. JOE TALKS ABOUT AI. I ASK: WHAT IS THE BUSINESS USE CASE? WHAT'S THE USE CASE FOR AI IN THE PHONE, AND IS IT GOING TO BE THEM LEADING OR FOLLOWING? I SUSPECT THEM FOLLOWING AGAIN. WE DON'T EVEN KNOW THE USE CASES FOR AI OTHER THAN AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL, OTHER THAN SEARCHING, FOR YOU KNOW BOOKS OR ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITH MICROSOFT AND CHATGPT. NOBODY WAS FOCUSED ON THE CAR. IT'S BEEN TEN YEARS IN THE MAKING AND IT SHOWS TO ME THAT THE APPLE BRAND HAS ATROPHIED A LITTLE BIT. I KNOW IT WILL BE CONTROVERSIAL. IF YOU GO BACK 15 YEARS AGO, EVERY AUTO COMPANY WOULD HAVE BEEN JUMPING IN TO SAY: LET US WHITE LABEL A CAR FOR YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE SO POWERFUL. THEY'VE BEEN UNABLE TO GET ANYBODY TO DO IT. THEY'RE NOT A CAPITAL INTENS.",[1]
1,BOm0zNiaNjg,Alphabet's AI problems: Stock falls 4%,CNBC Television,2024-02-26 19:01:28+00:00,"â™ª. >>>. WELCOME BACK. LET'S TALK ALPHABET. IT IS UNDER PERFORMING, UNDER PRESSURE TODAY AND THIS YEAR AS WELL, LOOK AT IT- DOWN 4%. WE HAVE JOE, JIM JOSH, THAT ALL OWN SHARES OF ALPHABET. THIS IS ON THE GEMINI ROLLOUT, WHICH I THINK IS SAFE TO SAY HAS BEEN A BIT OF A DEBACLE >>. THIS IS FRUSTRATING AND IT'S FRUSTRATING BECAUSE, COMING INTO THE YEAR, I IDENTIFIED ALPHABET AS ONE OF THE MEGA CAPS. I FELT HAD THE MOST OPPORTUNITY TO CATCH UP IN TERMS OF PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO THE OTHER ONES AND I WANT TO PERSONALLY BUY IT AND I HAVEN'T PERSONALLY BOUGHT IT. STOCK WAS AROUND 153.. THE STOCK NEVER RECOVERED FROM THE EARNINGS REPORT. THERE WAS SOFTNESS IN THE GOOGLE AD REVENUE. NOW WE COME IN THIS MORNING AND THE STOCK IS DOWN 4% AND YOU ARE QUESTIONING WHETHER. IN FACT, THIS COMPANY CAN BE A RELIABLE SOURCE WHEN YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT AI, AND WHAT HAPPENED LAST WEEK IS TROUBLESOME WITH GENERATOR AND YOU THINK GOING FORWARD: OKAY, CAN I HAVE CONFIDENCE IN WHAT THEY ARE DOING IN AI? CLEARLY, THE MARKET IS DEBATING. THAT RIGHT NOW, IT'S VERY FRUSTRATING. >>. JOE, EXCELLENT COMMENTS. IT'S RIGHT TO HAVE QUESTIONS AND I WILL GIVE YOU AN OPINION AND CAN'T GUARANTEE THIS, BUT I THINK THE QUESTION IS YES. YOU CAN OWN GOOGLE HERE AND ADD TO IT AT THESE LEVELS AND FEEL CONFIDENT -- >>. CAN YOU TRUST THEM AS RELIABLE? >>. CAN YOU TRUST ANYTHING ABOUT THE FUTURE? LET ME TRY AND ANSWER YOUR QUESTION. HANG ON, YOU INTERRUPTED ME BEFORE I FULLY ANSWERED THE QUESTION. IF YOU GO BACK A YEAR AGO, WHEN BARRED FIRST MESSED UP AND THE SATELLITE QUESTION AND THEN THE STOCK WENT DOWN, IT'S UP 56% AND IT'S NOT LIKE THE REST OF THE AI STOCKS BUT IT'S WITH THE S&P 500 RETURN. FUNDAMENTALLY, YOU HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE BEGINNING. THIS IS THE COMPANY THAT HAS OWNED DEEP MIND FOR MANY, MANY YEARS. IT IS ONE OF THE PIONEERS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND THEY HAD MISSTEPS, AND THAT'S BECAUSE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS HARD. MAYBE IT'S SIMPLY REALLY INNOVATIVE AND YOU WILL MAKE MISTAKES ALONG THE WAY, AND I THINK GOOGLE AND ALPHABET HAS THE TOOLS IN PLACE TO SUCCEED IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. >>. INTERESTING THAT? IT'S CHEAP FOR A REASON. THIS IS ACCORDING TO A BARRON'S ARTICLE. IT'S CHEAP FOR A REASON. THE ANALYST SAID IT HAS A MOTOR BECAUSE OF SEARCH, OBVIOUSLY, AND IT'S ABOUT TO BE DISRUPTED. HOW BIG OF A DEAL IS THIS FOR YOU? >>. IT IS A BIG DEAL BECAUSE IN SILICON VALLEY, STOCK PRICES BECOME THE PERCEPTION THAT DRIVES STOCK PRICES IN THE SHORT-TERM CAN ALWAYS CROSS OVER AND BECOME REALITY. GEORGE SOROS CALLS IT REFLEXTIVE TEE, WHERE PRICES IN THE ACTIONS OF SECURITIES BECOMES THE REALITIES THESE COMPANIES LIVE IN, BECAUSE EVERYBODY CAN SEE HOW EVERYBODY ELSE FEELS. LET ME NOT MINCE WORDS. THERE'S A PROBLEM AT ALPHABET. THEY DID WAY TOO MUCH HIRING AND IMPORTED A VIRUS. THEY HAVE PEOPLE RUNNING AROUND THERE, APPARENTLY AT EVERY LEVEL. THAT THINKSIT'S THEIR JOB: TO HEAL SOCIAL INJUSTICES AND TRY TO FIX PROBLEMS IN SOCIOECONOMIC PROBLEMS AND RACIAL ISSUES AND GENDER EQUALITY ISSUES. AND THEY THINK THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE, USING SOFTWARE PRODUCTS TO HEAL THESE WOUNDS THAT, IN SOME CASES, ARE THOUSANDS OF YEARS BEEN AFFLICTING THE HUMAN RACE. I THINK THESE PEOPLE HAVE TO EITHER DECIDE THEY WANT TO HELP ADVANCE THE COMPANY'S INTERESTS, OR THEY HAVE TO BE LET GO. YOU WATCHED META, SPEND A YEARPE COURSE. IT'S ALWAYS LAYOFFS, TARGETED LAYOFFS RELATED TO GETTING LEAN AND PROFITABILITY. THE REALITY IS YOU HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE BUILDING THAT HAVE THEIR OWN AGENDA. THAT",[3]
2,cTncTPylZQ8,Apple shares touch a 4-month low,CNBC Television,2024-03-05 17:54:20+00:00,"AT THAT LINE BUT DID DIP BELOW AS I LOOK AT IT IN REAL TIME. WE'RE RIGHT THERE AT 170.. >> IT'S A HEAVY TAPE. THIS IS WHAT A HEAVY TAPE LOOKS LIKE. >> A HEAVY STOCK AND A GOOD TAPE. THAT'S THE PROBLEM. >> THAT IS THE PROBLEM. SALES ARE WORSE THAN EXPECTED. ANYBODY WHO IS FUNDAMENTAL ON THE STOCK LOOKING AT CHINA AS AN AREA, THAT IS GANGBUSTERS BECAUSE OF WHAT THE ECONOMY IS DOING. AT THE END OF THE DAY, THIS IS STILL APPLE. THE SERVICES BUSINESS IS FABULOUS. I'M NOT PARTICULARLY VERY BULLISH ON THE EYE WEAR THEY'VE COME OUT WITH. THIS IS A MID-20s MULTIPLE. I'M COMFORTABLE WITH MY OWNERSHIP IN IT. I'VE HAD ABOUT HALF THE MARKET WEIGHT IN IT. YOU SAY, GEE, I WISH I DIDN'T OWN ANY OF IT. THIS STOCK WILL FIND ITS LEVEL. I SUSPECT IT'S AROUND 160. BUT HONESTLY, FOLKS, YOU HAVE TO JUST LET IT FIND ITS LEVEL. WHEN IT DOES, WHEN IT BOTTOMS OUT, I WILL BE ADDING TO IT. THERE IS NO FATAL FLAW HERE. >> JOSH, WHAT DO WE DO WITH THE STOCK AND WHAT'S THE RIGHT WAY TO VIEW IT IF YOU OWN IT IN A YEAR? THUS FAR WHERE THE OTHER BIG NAMES IN THE SPACE HAVE JUST STOLEN THE THUNDER. HERE WE TALK NONSTOP ABOUT AI. APPLE DOESN'T TALK ABOUT APPLE NONSTOP. THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT IT BARELY AT ALL, BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING. YET >> THE FIRST DECISION: ARE YOU AN INVESTOR OR TRADER? YOU'RE A TRADER. YOU'RE NOT IN THE STOCK. ANYMORE. IF YOU HAVE ANY SELL DISCIPLINE, LIKE AN ACTUAL TRADER, THEN YOU ARE ALREADY OUT. IT'S GONE NEGATIVE. THE HIGHEST HIGH WAS IN DECEMBER AND MOMENTUM IS TOXICALLY LOW. IT'S 30.. IF YOU'RE A SHORT-TERM TRADER- AN EXIT IN ADVANCE- YOU'RE ALREADY OUT. IF YOU'RE AN INVESTOR, IT'S A DIFFERENT CONVERSATION. YOU HAVE NOT BEEN REWARDED FOR PANICKING OUT OF APPLE BECAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID THEY WILL MISS THE TECHNOLOGY CYCLE. THEY'RE NEVER FIRST. IF YOU'VE PANICKED OUT OF APPLE BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT THEY WERE FALLING BEHIND ON INNOVATION, YOU HAVE BEEN SEVERELY PUNISHED. I DIDN'T EXPECT THEM TO BE LEADING THE CHARGE ON AI. THEY'VE NEVER DONE SO. THEY CAME OUT WITH THE I POT AND TOOK THE WHOLE GAME OVER THE iPHONE, CAME OUT SEVEN YEARS AFTER EVERYONE ELSE'S AND DOMINATED THE GAME. THIS HAPPENS AGAIN AND AGAIN. IF YOU'RE AN INVESTOR, TAKE A STEP BACK. TAKE A DEEP BREATH. ASK YOURSELF WHERE ON THE CHART IT MADE SENSE TO BE CONCERNED WITH RECENT PRICE PERFORMANCE. YOU CAN'T FIND THAT PLACE. THAT'S MY ATTITUDE. I LAUGH AT THE DOWNGRADES. THE STOCK HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE. IT HAS SIX MONTHS A YEAR WHERE IT DOESN'T GIVE YOU MUCH. I CAN LIVE WITH THAT. >>. SARAT, THE BULLS ARE OUT DEFENDING IT LIKE DAN IVES. SENTIMENT IS DISMAL BECAUSE OF THE HED WINDS IN CHINA AND LOSING MARKET. SHARE AND DELIVERIES ET CETERA HAVE BEEN GOING ON FOR MONTHS NOW THERE'S OPTIMISM ABOUT ESTIMATES REMAIN HITTABLE. FOR THE iPHONE SERVICES BEING ROCK SOLID. AI IS COMING. IT'S A MATTER OF WHEN, NOT IF, AND PROBABLY WILL BE WWDC AND THEY HAVE THIS INSTALL BASE. SO YOU'RE IN THE STOCK TOO. WHAT ARE WE THINKING HERE WITH THE STOCK, AS WE SAID, BREAKING 170, SITTING THERE AS WE SPEAK >>. I'M WITH JOSH AND JIM ON THIS ONE. YOU DON'T TRADE THIS ONE. YOU HOLD IT AND IT WILL HAVE ITS CONSOLIDATION. IT'S HAVING NOW NO NEW NEWS AND YOU'RE GETTING TRADERS SELLING AWAY OR TRIMMING POSITIONS. I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT THE SYSTEM- THE ECOSYSTEM IS REALLY WHY. YOU HOLD THE STOCK AND THEN THE CASH FLOW. SO WHAT THEY CAN DO WITH THE CASH FLOW- BUY BACK SHARES OR INVEST IN OTHER AREAS THEY'RE DOING BOTH OF. SO, AS A LONG-TERM INVESTOR, THIS IS NOT ONE THAT YOU WANT TO TRADE. WHEN IT'S COMING OFF, AS SOME OF THE OTHER MEGA CAPS ARE, IT'S OKAY. AND TO JIM'S POINT AT A CERTAIN POINT WHEN IT COMES BACK DOWN, YOU CAN START ADDING TO IT AGAIN TO THIS. IT IS A SOLID COMPANY AND IT'S VERY WELL DIVERSIFIED AND IT WILL LEAD. YOU HAVE ALL THE OTHER PLAYERS A LITTLE BIT AHEAD BUT THEN IT CATCHES UP FAST >>. IT'S DRIVING UP THE WHOLE MARKET IN A ACCEPTS TODAY, A BIG PLAYER IN THE NASDAQ, NASDAQ'S DOWN SHARPLY. I HAVE STEVE KOVACH, OUR TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT, SITTING AT THE DESK. SHANNON. I WANT TO BRING KOVACH IN FIRST IT'S. A MOMENT THAT YOU DON'T ORDINARILY SEE, AND EVEN WHEN YOU DO, YOU'RE PRETTY MUCH CONVINCED. THINGS WILL TURN. WHAT'S THE TURNING POINT HERE? >> MOMENT IS THE EXACT WAY TO PUT IT. YOU MIGHT REMEMBER 11,, 12 YEARS AGO. HERE COMES SAMSUNG WITH THE BIG SCREEN PHONES. APPLE IS DOOMED. THEY PUT OUT A BIG SCREEN PHONE- BIGGEST UPGREAT CYCLE EVER. HERE WE ARE WITH THE AI MOMENT. WHAT IS APPLE'S POSITION IN AI? WHERE DOES IT PLAY? INTO THE STORY? WE'RE HEARING FROM ITS PEERS, FROM META, GOOGLE AND SO FORTH. WE DON'T KNOW. WHAT YOU HAVE TO HOPE. IS THAT APPLE? A COUPLE YEARS AGO HIRED THIS EXECUTIVE NAME WHO CAME FROM GOOGLE AAI GENIUS. HE REPORTS TO TIM COOK. THIS IS TIME TO SHOW HIS WORK. WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE? THE COMPANY HAS PUT ENORMOUS PRESSURE ON ITSELF TO KNOCK THEIR STOCKS OFF. THEY NEED A NEW ONE. BUT BECAUSE THEY WANT THE AI FEATURE >>. I WROTE AS YOU WERE SPEAKING. I WROTE DOWN PRESSURE INSIDE CUPERTINO. YOU KNOW TIM COOK BETTER THAN MOST CALM, COOL AND COLLECTED AS ANY CEO WE EVER SEE OR DEAL WITH THEY'RE FEELING IT. THEY HAVE TO BE. >>. YOU SAID: THANK GOD THEY HAVE A BUYBACK. >>. YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT TIM COOK IS THINKING? THE SHIFT IN TONE FROM THE WAY HE TALKS ABOUT AI HAS CHANGED OVER THE LAST YEAR, JUST LAST WEEK TALKING ABOUT FEATURES THAT HAD BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOREVER: FITNESS TRACKING ON YOUR APPLE WATCH. BE LABELING THAT AS AI. YESTERDAY NEW MACBOOKS CAME OUT. THEY CALL IT BASICALLY THE BEST CONSUMER PC YOU CAN BUY. IT'S ALL MARKETING RIGHT NOW NOTHING TO SUPPLEMENT THAT OR DELIVER ON IT, BUT THEY ARE CHANGING THEIR STORY. THEY WOULD SAY MACHINE LEARNING OR SOME OTHER CONCEPT AROUND IT. NOW IT'S AI, AI, AI. THEY KNOW THAT'S WHAT THE MARKET WANTS TO HEAR. >> IT'S CHINA, IT'S REGULATORY, IT'S AI APPLE GETTING IT FROM ALL FRONTS >>. I THINK THERE'S GIVE AND TAKE IT WAS MORE THAN HAPPY TO LOOK ASIDE FROM THE POTENTIAL REWARDS ON THE HORIZON. APPLE ITSELF HAS REALLY SET US UP TO NO LONGER LOOK AT HAND SETS BUT LOOK AT SERVICES. LAST QUARTER SERVICES WAS DISAPPOINTING BUT STILL GROWING ROBUSTLY. THE CHALLENGE IS THAT IF YOU CAN ONLY ALLOCATE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF YOUR PORTFOLIO, YOU'RE PROBABLY LOOKING AT STOCKS THAT HAVE MOMENTUM, HAVE BEEN PERFORMING BETTER RATHER THAN BEING ON THE CONSUMPTION SIDE. I THINK JOSH HAS A GREAT POINT HERE. THEY'RE NOT LOOKING TO BE THE LEAD DISRUPTER. LOOK AT THIS DIVERGENCE BETWEEN META AND APPLE. WHEN FACEBOOK BECAME META AND THEY REALLY STARTED FOCUSING ONLY ON WHAT WAS HAPPENING FROM A VIRTUAL PERSPECTIVE, THAT STOCK LANGUISHED BECAUSE THEY WERE PUTTING THE MONEY IN TO FIND THE PROOF OF CONCEPT. APPLE IS MORE THAN WILLING TO LET ITS COMPETITORS FIND THE PROOF OF CONCEPT AND THEN MONETIZE IT. AND TO THE POINT ABOUT THEIR INSTALL BASE: WE CANNOT LOOK PAST THAT. THAT IS NOT GOING TO BE DISRUPTED. NO OTHER ELECTRONIC CONSUMER COMPANY IN MY OPINION THAT WILL BE ABLE TO CREATE SUCH A STRONG INSTALL BASE. DO WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR IT PERHAPS? THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY CAN'T CONTINUE TO GR.",[1]

JOINING US NOW ON THE COMPANY AND THE CHALLENGES FACING THE CEOIS, THE FORMER, NBC CABLE PRESIDENT AND CNBC CONTRIBUTOR. WE KNOW DAVID. WE WORKED WITH DAVID. YOU WORKED WITH HIM FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS. TOM, HE DOESN'T LIKE IT WHEN STOCKS DON'T GO UP. HE'S USED TO THAT AT DISCOVERRY AND HAS DONE SO WELL, THERE. THERE ARE REALITIES OF THIS BUSINESS THAT I'M NOT SURE ANYONE KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT TO DO AND HOW TO MAKE STOCKS GO UP AT THIS POINT >>. WELL, IT'S IN A TOUGH POSITION, JOE AND YOU'RE RIGHT. THERE'S NO CLEAR PLAYBOOK AS TO HOW TRADITIONAL MEDIA COMPANIES CAN PLAY THIS ENVIRONMENT LOOK. DAVID'S PROVED THEY KNOW HOW TO TAKE OUT COSTS AND GOT SOME HELP FROM THE VARIOUS STRIKES IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO TAKE OUT COSTS MORE. THEY'VE PROVED THEY CAN DELEVER USING THE CASH FLO THEY'RE GENERATING TO PAY DOWN DEBT HOWEVER, HOW MUCH AND BY WHEN HAS BEEN STRETCHED OUT SOME. THE BIG QUESTION HANGING OVER THE COMPANY IS: CAN IT GROW? AND THAT'S A BIG QUESTION. THEY GOT REALLY HIT ON ADVERTISING REVENUE THE NETWORKS, PARTICULARLY DOMESTICALLY. ACCORDING TO BRIAN, WHO'S PROBABLY THE BEST ADVERTISING ANALYST OUT THERE, IT LOOKS LIKE AN 18% DECLINE ON DOMESTIC NETWORK AD REVENUES. THAT'S VERY, VERY TOUGH TO MAKE UP AND IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING TO CONTINUE ALONG THAT VEIN AND THEN THEIR DIRECT TO CONSUMER STREAMING STUFF IS REALLY OBSCURE. THEY PUT TRADITIONAL HBO CABLE, SAT LELLITE STREAMING NUMBERS A OUT THERE. THEY PUT HEADLINES OUT THERE. THEY'RE THE FIRST TO HIT PROFITABILITY ON THEIR DIRECT TO CONSUMER OPERATIONS BUT AGAIN, THAT'S WITH TRADITIONAL HBO IN THERE AND EVEN WITH THAT. THEY LOST MONEY IN THE FOURTH QUARTER ON ALL THAT.

SOME PEOPLE HAVE SUGGESTED TRIFECTA FOR THAT SPORTS STREAMING.

WELL, WHAT THEY REALLY NEED IS TO GET THE NBA REVIEWED. IF THAT DOESN'T GET DONE, THEY CAN'T COME TOGETHER. THAT'S A CENTRAL INGREDIENT WITH THAT PART OF THE CLUB. IT'S UNCLEAR TO ME THAT THEY NECESSARILY WIN THIS. I THINK COMCAST NBC HAS SOME INTEREST THERE. NBC HAS A BROADCAST NETWORK AND I THINK THE REACH FOR PROFESSIONAL SPORTS LEAGUES OF A BROADCAST NETWORK CONTINUES TO HAVE MAJOR APPEAL. SO I'M NOT SURE. IF THEY DON'T WIN THAT- THAT THE JVACT MATERIALIZES. IF THEY DON'T, THE HIT REVENUE IS GOING TO HUGELY DECLINE. THAT'S A MUST SITUATION FOR THEM. IF IT COMES TOGETHER, I THINK THERE'S A BETTER ARGUMENT TO BE MADE. >> WHEN WOULD SOSNOFF HAVE TO DECIDE HE WOULD DO SOMETHING REALLY BIG? >> APRIL IS THE TIME, THE SPIN-OFF. THEY COULD DO IT. >>. I THINK BREAKING UP THE COMPANY TOM THE TAXES ARE A REAL TOUGH ISSUE. NO >>. YES, THAT'S A TOUGH SCENARIO. LOOK, I THINK THERE ARE TWO PLAYERS THAT HAVE A LOT OF ELEVEN: RAJ OVER WARNER BROS, DISCOVERY ONE I WAS SAYING WAS THE NB A. I THINK IT HAS ENORMOUS LEVERAGE IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS- AND SECONDLY, COMCAST NBC. IF THERE'S GOING TO BE A MEGA MERGER, THAT'S FAR MORE LIKELY THAN WARPER AND PARAMOUNT GETTING TOGETHER. BUT I THINK BRIAN HAS MOST OF THE CARDS THERE. IN TERMS OF IF AND WHEN THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN, I CAN'T SEE THAT IT'S NECESSARILY IN THEIR INTEREST TO DO ANYTHING SOON. SO IT'S REALLY A QUESTION OF GROWTH. I THINK THE TIME MAY BE COMING THAT THEY HAVE TO OWN UP TO WHETHER RENAMING THE STREAMING SRD MAX WAS THE BEST IDEA HERE. THEY LOST TWO MILLION STREAMING SUBS YEAR OVER YEAR. THEY LOST HALF A MILLION DOMESTIC STREAMING SUBS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER. I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF INDICATION IN TERMS OF PURE ENGAGEMENT. DESPITE ALL THE EMMYS THAT THEY WIN, THERE'S STILL A PERCENTAGE OF TELEVISION TIME WHERE THEY IF NEED TO GET MUCH MORE ABOVE THAT, SO WAS THAT THE RIGHT MOVE IS HBO, STILL SYNONYMOUS WITH QUALITY, AND SHOULD THEY BE MOVING BACK IN A DIRECTION WHICH LIGHTS THAT UP FOR PEOPLE WHO REALLY WANT TO LOOK TO IT AS THE PLACE TO GO FOR MAJOR STREAMING TELEVISION >>. THE NUMBERS DON'T REALLY ADD UP. I GUESS IT'S THE MAGNIFICENT 7 THAT HAVE THE MARKET CAP. YOU LOOK AT COMCAST, THAT'S AT 64.. IT WAS AT 41.. LOOK AT WARNER BROS DISCOVERY: DISNEY IS AT 207.. WHERE DID THE MARKET CAP GO? NETFLIX WAS OVER 700.. IT'S NOT EVEN THERE. WHERE IS IT? MEDIA IS A GREAT BUSINESS. WHERE THE HELL IS THE? -- WHERE THE'S THE STAR >>. WELL, NETFLIX IS THE STAR, CLEARLY. YES, IT'S BELOW, HIGH, BUT IT'S CONTINUING TO DECLINE SINCE IT'S HIT, ITS LOW AND IT'S CLEARLY SET ITSELF FROM THE REST OF THE PACK. IT'S HU I WILL I PROFITABLE, GENERATING MASSIVE CASH FLOW ABLE TO MAINTAIN MAJOR PROGRAMMING BUDGETS ON THE STREAMING SIDE, AND IT HAS AN INTERNATIONAL GAME.

THAT IS USUALLY A SIGN OF A PRETTY DURABLE RALLY WITH STOCKS AT RECORD. HIGH THE ECONOMY LOOKING. OKAY, YOU HAVE THE FED NOT DOING ANYTHING TODAY. STOP THINKING ABOUT RATE CUTS.

IT GOT PICKED UP AND SO THE BUYERS ARE GETTING REWARDED IMMEDIATELY, AND IT REMINDS ME OF THE BEGINNINGS OF 2013,. 2017, WHERE YOU HAD THIS ACCEPTANCE OF THE BULLISH CONSENSUS ABOUT THE MARKETS. THE MARKET KEPT GOING EVEN THOUGH IT FELT LIKE IT HAD TO PULL BACK. THAT IS NOT A PREDICTION BUT AN OBSERVATION. >>. WHAT SET THE STAGE FOR ALL OF THIS WAS A REVERSAL IN FUNDAMENTALS. YOU FOSTER FROM THAT IS A VERY STRONG TECHNICAL RALLY AND A LOT OF TIMES. WHEN YOU BREAK OUT FROM A SIGNIFICANT HIGH IN THE JANUARY 22, HI WAS SIGNIFICANT IN TERMS OF THE DURATION IN WHICH YOU DIDN'T REVISIT ONCE AGAIN, NEARLY TWO YEARS. ONCE YOU BREAK OUT OF THAT, THE BEARISH ARGUMENT IS THAT YOU WILL POTENTIALLY GET A FAILED BREAKOUT. THIS WAS THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE. YOU ARE 6% ABOVE THAT BREAKOUT HIGH.

TO BECOME A PROBLEM, YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT CAUSES PEOPLE TO THE RISK -- DENIED THE RISK, WE SEE RECOVERY, ENCYCLICAL AREAS. THOSE ESTIMATES MIGHT HAVE SOME UPSIDE. THAT MEANS UNTIL WE GET THEM TO TURN OVER. THEN VALUATION, SENTIMENT AND POSITIONING BECOME POOR TIMING TOOLS >>. THAT IS SUCH A GREAT POINT. THERE HAS TO BE A SHOCK AT THIS POINT, IN THIS BREAKOUT OF THE TREND- AND I DON'T THINK IT COMES FROM THE ECONOMIC DATA. I THINK, RIGHT NOW SITTING THERE BEING THE MONDAY MORNING ARMCHAIR ECONOMIST IS GOING TO HURT YOU. YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A DIS- INFLATIONARY TREND IN PLACE AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND THE CENTRAL BANKS ARE LOOKING TO BEGIN A RATE CUTTING CYCLE. SO DON'T FOCUS SO MUCH ON THE ECONOMICS.

THEY DO THE SAME THING, DAME, BUT THEY ARE EXECUTING AND THEY ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT IN THE FUTURE, THERE TALK ABOUT RIGHT NOW. THIS IS A GOOD GLIMPSE INTO HOW NOT EFFICIENT MARKETS ARE. STOCK IS UP 30% BEFORE IT CAME ON TO THE SHOW. CLEARLY, THIS WAS NOT PRICED IN DALLAS SEEING INCREDIBLE SERVER DEMANDS FROM THE AI SPACE. AGAIN, IT IS MORE ABOUT THE GUIDANCE: 40% BACKLOG INCREASE OVER Q3.. THE INCREASE TOPLINE TO 95 BILLION FULL YEAR. SEVEN AND A HALF, WHICH MEANS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 16 TIMES FORWARD EARNINGS. IF THEY WERE TO HIT THAT, THAT IS A FANTASTIC FUNDAMENTAL PICTURE: 30% NOT GOING TO CHASE IT.

THEY HAVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF DEBT AGAIN JUST WHEN YOU START GETTING COMFORTABLE ABOUT ORDERS- THE DREAMLINER BEING DELIVERED- THERE IS SOMETHING THAT COMES OUT THAT JUST LACKS THE STOP FUNDAMENTALLY WAY TOO MUCH DEBT, NEGATIVE BOOK VALUE NOT ATTRACTIVE TO US, JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE GOING TO BUY A SUPPLIER THAT POTENTIALLY IS TROUBLED AS WELL.",[78]

BEN, WE HAVE YOU ON ALL THE TIME, BUT YOU ALWAYS COME UP WITH CLEVER TITLES AND INTERESTING NOTES. NOW WE WILL DIVE INTO THIS LATEST ONE FROM YOU FIRST BEFORE I GET TO THE NOTES. WHY DID WE SEE CHIP STOCKS SELL AS MUCH AS WE DID TODAY, INCLUDING NVIDIA, WHICH HAS BEEN ON THIS RAMPANT RISE FOR MONTHS NOW? >>. IT WAS A FUN MORNING UNTIL. IT WASN'T. NOTHING GOES UP IN A STRAIGHT LINE. YOU SAW SOME LIKE THE APPLES AND GOOGLE'S CATCH A BIT TODAY. I THINK THERE HAS JUST REALLY BEEN A CONSENSUS CALL, THAT SOME OF THESE ARE STRUGGLING, AND THERE WAS A LOT OF SHORT COVERING TODAY. PERHAPS IN THOSE NAMES AND EVERYBODY WAS ALONG THE SAME NAMES, HOWEVER. WE HAVE SEEN THIS BEFORE. WE HAVE SEEN SOME DIGESTION DAYS. WE ARE IN A ONCE, IN A GENERATION CYCLE IN MY OPINION. SO WE ARE STAYING THE COURSE. WE THOUGHT WE COULD GET OUT A LITTLE BIT ON A QUIET FRIDAY, BUT NOT SO QUIET ANYWAYWE ARE STAYING THE COURSE. >>. SOUNDS LIKE PROFIT TAKING AFOOT AND WE DID GET EARNINGS INVESTORS PICKED APART. LET'S TALK ABOUT NVIDI MINI. YOU TALK ABOUT THE PHASE, WHICH IS IN FOCUS FOR INVESTORS LOOKING AT THE PICKS AND SHOVELS OF AI? >>. THAT'S RIGHT WELL. WE ACTUALLY UPGRADED IN AMD A COUPLE MONTHS AGO AND IT SEEMS LIKE AN ETERNITY AGO AND A MUCH LOWER PRICE. IT'S BEEN RIPPING UP UNTIL TODAY. I THINK THAT THE INFERENCING PHASE IS NEAT, BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS AFTER. YOU TRAIN A MODEL AND THEN YOU START TYPING OR SPEAKING INTO. THESE BEGUN GETTING STUFF UT OF IT. INFERENCING IS GOING TO EXPLODE AS MODELS GO INTO PRODUCTION. A CHIP IS EXCELLENT FOR INFERENCING. IT'S AN EXCELLENT CHIP. FRANKLY, WHAT WE THINK IS GOING TO HAPPEN IS THESE ARE LIKE MINI NVIDIA ON ABOUT A NINE MONTH DELAY. CLOUD PROVIDERS WILL BE BUYING THIS IN DROVES. I THINK YOU WILL SEE UP SIDE REUNION VISIONS. WE THINK THIS CHIP FITS THAT NICHE AND INFERENCING WELL. YOU WILL SEE GUYS LIKE META AND MICROSOFT BUYING IT QUITE A BIT. IT'S SETTING THEM UP WELL FOR NEXT YEAR, OBVIOUSLY, NVIDIA IS STILL THE LEADER. WE THINK THEY'RE DOING GREAT >>. I AM LOOKING AT A CHART OF RELATIVE STRENGTH OF AMD AND NVIDIA. AMD HAS TWO EXTRA AND NVIDIA ALMOST THREE. WHAT THE WOULD IT TAKE FOR AMD TO HAVE THE PERFORMANCE OF NVIDIA? WOULD IT BE THIS PRODUCT COMING OUT, PROVING TO BE THE NVIDIA SUBSTITUTE? REALLY MAKE A STRONG, VALUE ARGUMENT. >>. THIS PRODUCT IS GOING TO HAVE A STRONG ARE SMALLER SHARE THAN NVIDIA. WE THINK IT IS DOING EVERYBODY A FAVOR, DEVELOPING THIS MARKET FOR EVERYONE WITH THE FULL STACK APPROACH. WE FEEL THEY'RE SO DOMINANT AND DOING SUCH A GOOD JOB. THE PROVIDERS ARE LIKE. WE NEED NUMBER TWO. NVIDIA IS DOING THAT. I THINK THIS CHIP IS GOING TO BE IN STRONG DEMAND. I WILL BE SURPRISED IF AMD GETS MORE THAN A 10% SHARE OF THE MARKET BUT THAT'S PLENTY. I MEAN THAT IS MASSIVE. UP SIDE REVISIONS FROM WHERE WE ARE ACTUALLY. YOU JUST SHOWED A GRAPHIC OF THE AI REVENUE. I THINK THERE IS UP SIDE TO THOSE. I FEEL WHEN WE SEE THEM REPORT THROUGH THE YEAR YOU CAN SEE NVIDIA LIKE IN TERMS OF UP SIDE BUT THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE INFERENCING THING THEY SHOULD DO WELL >>. I THINK JENSON WONG WOULD SAY- I KNOW HE WOULD BECAUSE HE HAS SOFTWARE IS A MOOT THAT DEVELOPERS WILL NEED TO WRITE. IS THAT GOING TO LIMIT AMD'S POTENTIAL NOW THAT THERE ARE SOME WHO ARE ALREADY WRITING TO THIS NVIDIA BASED ENVIRONMENT? EVEN IF AMD HAS SOMETHING THAT PERFORMANCE WISE PRICE PERFORMANCE WISE IS COMPETITIVE AND THEY'LL STILL WANT TO GO WITH NVIDIA. >>. I THINK THE BROAD MARKET IS. ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT THE CHIPS IS THEY CAN BE USED FOR INFERENCING AND TRAINING, YOU CAN GET THE MOST OUT OF THE INVESTMENTS. A LOT OF THE CLOUD PROVIDERS THAT WILL SEE THIS INFERENCING EXPLOSION WILL GO WITH AMD. AT LEAST FOR CERTAIN THINGS, THERE WILL BE A PLACE FOR IT. THEY'RE GOING TO WANT TO KEEP NVIDIA. THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DEVELOP SILICONE FOR EVERYTHING. THIS IS GOING TO FIT A CERTAIN NEED. NVIDIA IS GOING TO LEAD THIS. THEY HAVE A MOOT IN TRAINING WHICH WILL CONTINUE TO GROW. THEY HAVE A GREAT POSITION AND THEY WILL DO A LOT IN INFERENCING. I THINK AMD GETTING 10% A SHARE IS QUITE A BIT OF UP SIDE. WE TALK ABOUT IT IN THE NOTE TODAY, WHAT THE NUMBERS CAN LO.",[24]

WHAT IS THE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE SUPER 7 TO OUR MAGNIFICENT SEVEN >>? WHAT WE NOTICED THIS YEAR IS THERE HAS BEEN AN INTERESTING DYNAMIC PLAYING OUT IN THE EUROPEAN MARKET. EUROPEAN MARKETS ARE DOING WELL OUT, PERFORMING THE US. IT IS HAPPENING WITH THE NARROWING OF THE RETURNS TO THESE FEW STOCKS. WE HEARD ABOUT NARROWING IN THE US. LAST YEAR IT DID NOT HAPPEN IN EUROPE. THAT IS A NEW DYNAMIC. THERE IS A CATCH UP OF THE EUROPEAN MARKET FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF COURSE. CAVEAT. HERE IS, I WOULD LIKE, THE BROADENING OF THE MARKET WITH CIRCUMCYCLICAL MARKE BROADENING. THIS IS A NORMAL SITUATION. WE ARE HAVING RIGHT NOW. WE THINK IT IS DUE TO THE CATCH UP OF LAST YEAR.

IT SHOW THE LIST, NOVO NORDISK WITH A 52-WEEK HIGH ON TRIAL DATA. IT IS HARD TO NOT SEE. IT IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN. THE SUPER 7 IS LUXURY SPENDING. HOW SHOULD WE READ THAT? >>. THIS IS WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THE EUROPEAN SUPER 7.. IT IS MORE DIVERSE FROM THE SECTOR PERSPECTIVE THAN THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN. REALLY CROWDING INTO ONE THEME, YOU HAVE THE AI PLAY IN EUROPE IN THE SUPER 7. >>. ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT SAP? >> YES, ASML AS WELL, INDUSTRIAL PLAY WITH SCHNEIDER, AND THEN THE THREE CONSUMER STOCKS.

HERE IN THE US WE ARE LOOKING FOR OUR CENTRAL BANK TO CUT. HOW IMPORTANT IS THE CENTRAL BANK CUT TO THE STOCKS AND EQUITIES IN GENERAL? >>. THEY ARE VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE EUROPEAN EQUITIES IN GENERAL AND THE EUROPEAN ECONOMY. OUR VIEW IS: WE WILL HAVE FIVE CUTS FROM THE ECB THIS YEAR, FIVE FROM THE FED.

HE JOINS US TO TELL US WHAT IT IS. KEVIN, WELCOME BACK. >>. HEY, SCOTT. >> WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT? WHAT NAME DID YOU TRIM OFF? >>? WE TOOK A LITTLE BIT OF A PROFIT IN THE BROAD COLUMN. I KNOW THE SEMI'S HAVE BEEN ON FIRE AND IT IS SO HARD TO SELL STOCKS BECAUSE WE HAVE A TWO DECISION PROCESS. IF YOU SELL SOMETHING, THEN YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BUY SOMETHING ELSE TO KIND OF MONITOR- THE TWO THINGS AND IT IS NEVER EASY. BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT WHEN WE GET INTO BROAD CALM SCOTT, IT WAS IN SEPTEMBER AND WE SOLD OUT OF OUR APPLE POSITION IN ITS ENTIRETY AND WE TOOK A LOT OF HEAT FOR THAT BECAUSE WHO LIKES TO BE OUT OF APPLE? AT THE TIME WE THOUGHT THE MULTIPLES WERE A LITTLE BIT STRETCHED, SO WE ROTATED IT TO BROAD CALM AND THE STOCK IS UP 50% SINCE WE BROUGHT IT, KNOWING HOW CONSERVATIVE AND THAT DIVIDEND ORIENTED THE CHIP STRATEGY THAT WE RUN IS HOW OFTEN. DOES THAT HAPPEN? WE STILL LIKE THE NAME. WE HAVE EARNINGS COMING OUT ON THURSDAY. WE THINK THEY WILL BE GOOD BUT WE TOOK A LITTLE BIT OF THE PROPHET AND WE ROTATE IT TO APPLE. APPLE IS THE SAME STOP THAT WE HAD SOLD TO GET INTO BROADCOM. NOW WE ARE USING SOME PROFITS HERE. APPLE IS DOWN ABOUT 15% SINCE THE BEGINNING OF NOVEMBER, SO THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO REBUILD OUR APPLE POSITION HERE. COULD IT GO TO 160?? SURE, COULD CONCEIVABLY GO TO 150? MAYBE IT TAKES US A LONG TIME TO GET INTO A POSITION ON DAYS LIKE THIS: >> SURE, BUT YOU ARE NOT PINEAPPLE TODAY, YESTERDAY OR WHENEVER YOU DID IT ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT IT IS GOING TO GO DOWN TO 150.. CERTAINLY YOU ARE NOT EXPECTING THAT, OR YOU WOULDN'T HAVE DONE WHAT YOU DID. BUT WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE WEAKNESS IN THAT STOCK FOR SOMETHING THAT FRANKLY LOOKS BROKEN >>. YES, THEY ARE TAKING A COUPLE OF PUNCHES FROM DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. RIGHT NOW, BUT UNDER THE SURFACE WE THINK THAT THE MARGINS ARE AT ALL- TIME HIGHS AND WE LOVE THE FREE CASH FLOW BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE ALL ABOUT: FREE CASH FLOW FOR THE LAST 12 MONTHS BACK OVER $112 MILLION. SO FOR US, WE ARE NOT LOOKING AT APPLE AND SAYING IT IS TIME TO RUN FOR THE HILLS. I DON'T THINK IT S TIME TO GO TO 150, BUT YOU CAN'T TIE FOR THE EXACT TOP OR BOTTOM. IT IS STILL A LITTLE BIT HIGH, BUT I THINK 160 IS WHERE WE ARE GOING TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BACKFILL THIS PARTICULAR POSITION FOR US. IT IS ALSO A REALLY GOOD NAME TO WRITE CALLS ON, BECAUSE YOU GET VOLATILITY IN THE TECH NAMES THAT YOU DON'T IN A LOT OF OUR STOCKS. SO WE ARE EXCITED AT LOOKING AT THE IDEA OF APPLE ESPECIALLY. WE WANT TO BUY THINGS WHEN THEY ARE UNDER A LITTLE BIT OF PRESSURE. >> WHAT ABOUT MARATHON, WHICH I SEE YOU HAVE ADDED TOO THAT STOCK HASN'T BEEN UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE? HAS IT? >> NO, IN FACT SCOTT, IT IS AT A 52-WEEK HIGH TODAY >> EXACTLY, I GUESS IT WAS KIND OF A RHETORICAL QUESTION. >> [ LAUGHTER ]. HEY LISTEN, IF YOU LOOK AT THESE TWO COMPANIES, IT IS ALL ABOUT FREE CASH FLOW. APPLE IS RETURNING TONS AND TONS OF CASH TO SHAREHOLDERS, THROUGH BUYBACKS AND DIVIDENDS. SAME THING FOR PETROLEUM. THEY JUST COMMITTED ANOTHER $5.9 BILLION TO IMPLEMENT MORE SHARES OF BUYBACKS. I WAS LOOKING AT APPLE EARLIER. THEY CUT THEIR FLOW ALMOST IN HALF SINCE 2012.. MARATHON HAS DONE THE SAME THING SINCE 2021.. SO IT IS NOT LIKE YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE PRICE OF OIL. THE STOCK IS NOT GOING TO TRADE LIKE A COMMODITY, BUT FREE CASH FLOW. RETURNING STOCK TO SHAREHOLDERS, INCREASING DIVIDENDS: THESE ARE THE THINGS WE LOVE IN ANY INVESTMENT WE MAKE, AND THAT IS THE SIMILARITY BETWEEN MARATHON -- WHICH IS A 52 WEEK PRIMARY -- AND APPLE -- WHICH EVERYBODY WANTS TO RUN FOR THE HILLS TODAY, >> ROLL CALLS ON VISA AND McDONALD'S. TELL ME WHY. >>. THERE HASN'T BEEN A LOT OF VOLATILITY? YOU KNOW THIS WELL COVERING IT ON THE NETWORK FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS. WHENEVER WE CAN GET SOME SORT OF VOLATILITY BEHIND ANY NAME, WE WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT BOTH McDONALD'S AND VISA. THESE CALLS WERE EXPANDED NEXT FRIDAY, SO IT IS A SHORT-TERM OPPORTUNITY FOR US UT. WE ARE OFFERING PREMIUMS IN EXCESS OF 5%, SO THIS IS A VERY LOW DIVIDEND- AMAZING DIVIDEND GROWTH BUT ALLOWS US TO PRODUCE A BIT OF A HEDGE, A BIT OF AN EXTRA MEAL. FOR McDONALD'S SPECIFICALLY, IF YOU LOOK AT THE PRICE ACTION IN THE CHART IT GOES UP TO 300 AND BOUNCES THERE AND HAD SUCH TROUBLE BREAKING THROUGH 300.. I WISH IT COULD SPLIT LIKE WALMART DID, MAYBE. THAT IS A CONSIDERATION FOR McDONALD'S. WE HAVE BEEN REFERRING THEM FOR A DECADE OR MAYBE A SHORT-TERM CALL HEADING INTO THE VOLATILITY BUT IF WE SEE MORE VOLATILITY WE WILL BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT. I CERTAINLY EXPECT WE WILL AT APPLE IN PARTICULAR OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS? >>. ARE OU FEELING GOOD OVERALL ABOUT WHERE THE STOCK MARKET IS? >>. YEAH, I MEAN IT IS STRETCHED. THERE IS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MOMENTUM BEHIND IT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE FEAR AND GREED INDEX, WHEN YOU LOOK AT ENTHUSIASM FOR THE RETAIL INVESTOR, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PROFESSIONAL INVESTOR, EVERYBODY IS BULLISH BUT THE EARNINGS STATEMENT IS FAIRLY DECENT. INFLATION IS COMING DOWN EVEN THOUGH. ALL THE ECONOMIC DATA ISN'T PERFECT. YOU REFERENCED TODAY THE ISM SERVER IS UNDER 50, YOU NEVER WANT TO SEE THAT UNDER 50 FOR TOO LONG BUT IN GENERAL, YOU HAVE A STRONG CONSUMER. WE HAVE A LOT OF LABOR INFORMATION.

WELL, THEY ARE A SUPPLIER THAT GETS A WHOLE LOT OF EYEBALLS ON THINGS THAT RUN AI. AND ARE THEY GOING TO BE DISPLACED ANY TIME SOON? AND I THINK THE ANSWER IS NO. ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I CONTINUE TO OWN THIS IS THEY'RE UNBELIEVABLY STRONG MOAT. ONCE YOU BECOME A USER, TRY NOT TO BECOME A USER RIGHT.

MATERIALLY HIGHER >> I'M GOING TO SAY A BAD WORD: COMMODITY. I SAY THAT BECAUSE- DO YOU HAVE ANY WORRY AT ALL, DAN, THAT APPLE- WHICH, BY THE WAY, MAKES AMAZING COMPUTERS. THE VISION PRO LOOKS FANTASTIC. APPLE TV IS GREAT. THEY LIVE AND DIE MOSTLY BY THE iPHONE. DO YOU WORRY THAT IT'S BEING SEEN OR VIEWED BY INVESTORS AS A COMMODITY TYPE PRODUCT? >> BRIAN, GREAT POINT. BUT WE HAVE BEEN HERE. WE SEEN THIS BEFORE OVER THE YEARS, VIEWING IT AS A COMMODITY. BUT THERE'S 2.2 BILLION EASONS. IT'S NOT A COMMODITY, IT'S BECAUSE OF THAT INSTALL BASE, THE GOLDEN INSTALL BASE IN CUPERTINO. THAT'S THE REASON THAT WE REMAIN FIRMLY BULLISH ON THIS, BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT SERVICES AND IT'S THE INSTALL BASE. NOW AI IS COMING TO CUPERTINO. I THINK TO SELL THIS STOCK AHEAD OF THAT WOULD BE, YOU KNOW, NOT JUST A WRONG MOVE, IT WOULD HIT, HISTORICALLY WRONG MOVE. >>. WHAT IS APPLE'S ROLE IN AI? >> WE BELIEVE ON TWO FRONTS. THEY ARE GOING TO INTRODUCE A WWDC IN JUNE, THE START OF AN AI APP STORE. AI APPS IN THE ECOSYSTEM. THAT'S GOING TO BE SIGNIFICANT FROM A SERVICES BUSINESS. AND IN THE BIG ONE, THE DRUMROLL, THEY ARE GOING TO INCORPORATE AI INTO iPHONE.",[1]

STRONG SALES, GROWTH AS WELL. THE STOCK HAS RUN UP A LOT, SO I THINK EXPECTATIONS WERE HIGH. WE NEEDED REALLY STRONG EARNINGS TO SUPPORT THIS RICH EVALUATION AND WHILE THE RESULTS WERE NOT GOOD.

COSTCO IS ONE OF THE RETAILERS THAT HAVE LOWER PRICES. SO TO HAVE THAT INFLATION IS MONITORING WE SENSE. COSTCO IS LOWERING PRICES, ESPECIALLY ON DISCRETIONARY GOODS.

YOU COMPARE TO OTHER, RESTRUCTURING P&G CONSUMER PRODUCTS COMPANY, BUT I THOUGHT YOU SAID CITI'S OVER 12 WITH PREVIOUS RESTRUCTURING >>. I HAVE ONE WORD TO SUM UP MY VIEW: >> YOU BROUGHT A SIGN. >> YEAH. >>. OH, GOOD, OKAY. >> THUMBS UP TO CITIGROUP. >> CITI IS ON A DETOUR FROM 25 YEARS OF HORRIFIC PERFORMANCE TO IMPROVE PERFORMANT 0-12. WHEN IT COMES TO RESTRUCTURING, WE THINK FOR CITI NUMBER 13, THERE LUCKY NUMBER. WE THINK WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS IN SOME WAYS SUBTLE BUT EXTREMELY POWERFUL. THEY ARE GOING FROM THIS MATRIX MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE, ALL OF THESE COUNTRIES AND FUNCTIONS, TO FIVE LINES OF BUSINESS, VERY SIMPLE SERVICES: BANKING, MARKETS, CONSUMER AND WEALTH. THE FIVE HEADS OF THOSE BUSINESSES? YOU KNOW THEY ARE SCHMEAR ANDREW. TRY TO GET THEM RIGHT. WE HAVE ANDY SIEG, HEAD OF WEALTH, AND A COUPLE -- >> MERRILL LYNCH GUY. >> EXACTLY FIVE HEADS OF THESE BUSINESSES AND REPORT TO FRAZIER. THAT'S IT.

AND PEOPLE SAY: WELL, THIS GOING TO TAKE A LONG TIME TO WORK OUT. >> HOW LONG'S THE DETOUR. >> GUESS, WHAT THE ANSWER TO THAT [ SHOWING A ""DETOUR"" SIGN ]. >>. BY THE END, CITI WILL HAVE MADE ALL THE MAJOR DECISIONS ABOUT WHERE PEOPLE STAND WITHIN THE FIRM. THREE WEEKS FROM TODAY, 21 DAYS, PEOPLE SAY, OH, LOOK AT IT IN TWO, THREE YEARS. NO, YOU DON'T HAVE THAT LONG, OKAY. THREE WEEKS FROM TODAY. THEY'LL HAVE DELAYERED FROM 13 DOWN TO 8.. FIVE LINES OF BUSINESS: ACCOUNTABILITY, TRANSPARENCY.

THEY SAID: ELIMINATE 20,000 PEOPLE. IT'S PAINFUL BUT GOT ME FIRED A FEW TIMES. YOU KNOW A VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION, BUT I THINK THEY GET OVER THE HUMP SOON. SO PEOPLE SAY: WELL, CITI'S NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE. I'M WALKING AROUND THE WELLS FARGO EQUITY RESEARCH FLOOR AND WE HAVE DOZENS AND DOZENS'S ANALYSTS. AND THEN I FIND THE CONSUMER STAPLES ANALYST, CHRIS CARRIE. SOUNDS LIKE PROCTER & GAMBLE. SEVERAL YEARS AGO, HAD FUNCTIONS, WENT TO SIX LINES OF BUSINESS. CITI'S GOING TO FIVE LINES OF BUSINESS SOLD OFF BUSINESSES EQUAL TO 10% TO 15% REVENUE. CITI'S SELLING OFF REVENUES EQUAL TO THAT PROCTER & GAMBLE, ACCORDING TO OUR EXPERT AT WELLS FARGO, A CHALLENGED COMPANY. CITI'S A VERY CHALLENGED COMPANY. IT WORKED IN SPADES, ACCORDING TO ANALYSTS FOR PROCTER & GAMBLE, SO WORKED FOR THEM. IT CAN WORK FOR CITIGROUP. I LIKE YOUR VIEWERS, ANYONE WHO DEALS WITH ME OR YOU, IF YOU OWN PROCTER & GAMBLE, GIVE CITIGROUP A LOOK, BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF PARALLELS HERE, A WHOLE NEW REPORT THAT TALKS ABOUT THOSE PARALLELS. YOU SAY, OH, CITI'S NEVER DONE IT BEFORE, NEVER GONE TO FIVE LINES OF BUSINESSES SOLD 10%, 15,, 15% REVENUE BEFORE AND NEVER GAINS AT THE TOP NOWHERE TO HIDE YOU KNOW WHAT? THREE YEARS FROM NOW, BY 2026, SHE SAYS. SHE IS HIGHLY -- WITH HIGH CONVICTION. SHE EXPECTS CITI TO HAVE 11% TO 12% RETURN. BY THE WAY, MY ESTIMATE IS ONLY 10% AND I EXPECT THE STOCK TO DOUBLE GET TO A 10% RETURN TRADE A TANGIBLE BOOK VALUE WE HAVE AT $111 IN 2026.. NO HEROIC ASSUMPTIONS HERE, AND CONSENSUS IS ONLY 9%. BUT GUESS WHAT, IF SHE DOESN'T GET A 10% RETURN- DOUBLE-DIGIT RETURN- IN THREE YEARS FROM NOW, COULD BE OUT OF A JOB, BUT IF SHE GETS RETURNS, SHOULD BE BANKER OF THE YEAR. IN THIS INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY, THE ONLY WOMAN WHO HEADS A MAJOR US BANK, JANE FRAZIER HAS A CHANCE COULD FAIL, LIKE THE OTHER. 12 RESTRUCTURINGS OR WIND UP BEING BANKER OF THE YEAR- I'M LEANING TOWARDS- BANKER OF THE YEAR, NOT RISK-FREE- A GREAT PLAN BUT STILL HAVE TO EXECUTE >>. THESE ARE ALL JUST IN MY MIND. IT'S MOVING BETWEEN $4.50 AND $6.. I CAN'T SHAKE THE ONE FOR $10. AFTER THE FINANCIAL CRISIS, JAMIE DIMON WENT THROUGH THE SAME CRISIS.

AND HERE IS JERRY CASTELLINI, THE COFOUNDER AND CO-CIA AT MANAGEMENT. OUR FIRST NAME IS A STOCK THAT HAS TAKEN THE MARKET BY STORM. WE ARE TALKING SHARES OF SUPERMICRO COMPUTER. THEY ARE UP NEARLY 100% OVER THE PAST MONTH AND SHARES ARE HEADING AT ALL-TIME HIGH TODAY. THE NEWS OF THE COMPANY IS JOINING THE S&P 500, BUT, JERRY, YOUR COMPANY JUST ENTERED A SELLING PROGRAM ON THAT STOCK. WHY IS THAT? IT IS OF ABOUT 1000% OVER THE LAST 12 MONTHS >>. YEAH, MOST PROFESSIONAL INVESTORS WILL TAKE PROFITS, WILL PAIR POSITIONS BACK AS THE SIZING OF THE INCREASE. IT'S A RISK MANAGEMENT TOOL, AND WE DO IT AND WE THINK IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT. THIS IS BECOME OUR LARGEST HOLDING IN OUR SMALL-CAP PORTFOLIO. QUITE FRANKLY, IF YOU LOOK AT IT AND COMPARE IT TO, MAYBE A DELL OR NVIDIA AT THE OTHER END, THEY DO MORE LOW-MARGIN TYPE OF THINGS WITH RESPECT TO PUTTING ASSEMBLING THE DATA CENTER EQUIPMENT. THEY DON'T HAVE THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OF NVIDIA. IN OUR CASE, WE ARE TAKING PROFITS SELLING TODAY, NOT SELLING WHOLE POSITION BUT MOVING IT BACK TO THE SIZE IT WAS, SAY, A FEW MONTHS AGO, BEFORE IT HAD THIS RUN >>. OUR NEXT STOP IS ANOTHER NAME THAT WILL BE JOINING THE S&P 500, DECKERS OUTDOOR. THIS IS BEHIND UGGS, WHAT IS YOUR TRADE AND YOU HAVE ANY. THEY ARE SO COZY >>. I KNOW WOULD'VE THOUGHT THAT A HUG >> OR THAT THEY WOULD BE IN THE SANDAL BUSINESS. IT IS A VERY SMART BRAND EXTENSION STRATEGY ON THESE GUYS PART. IT SEEMS LIKE CONSUMERS ARE TAKING IT UP VERY WELL. YOU COMBINE THAT WITH THESE CRAZY NEW SHOES THAT YOU PROBABLY HAVE A PAIR OF THAT ARE RUNNING AROUND. IT'S A NEAT COMBINATION FOR A SHOEMAKER. REALLY, WHEN YOU COMPARE IT TO A NIKE WHICH IS BEING THREATENED BY DIFFERENT INTERNATIONAL AND TRADE ISSUES, HERE'S THIS DIRECT PLAY ON THE DIRECT CONSUMER RIGHT NOW, IN THE EXACT AREAS THAT WE SEEM TO SEE. A LOT OF POPULARITY, A LOT OF FOLKS WANT TO DO THESE THINGS MORE OF MORE COMFORTABLE SHOES OUTSIDE AND MORE ATHLEISURE, IF YOU WILL. THE COMBINATION IS A PRETTY POWERFUL ONE. WHILE IT IS EXPENSIVE, WE WOULD BUY ANY PULLBACK ON AND HERE. WE WOULD HOLD IT HERE >>. >>. ALL RIGHT DECKERS, A BIG NAME IN BRANDS OF FOOTWEAR OUT THERE. FINAL STOP. VIKING THERAPEUTICS. CNBC PUBLISHED THE ARTICLE ON SUNDAY SAYING THAT THE COMPANY IS EMERGING AS A STRONG WEIGHT LOSS DRUG PLAYER. THE SHARES ARE JUMPING HIGHER IN RESPONSE TO THAT. THE STOCK IS UP BY ALMOST 300% OVER THE COURSE OF THE PAST MONTH JERRY DOES, VIKING THERAPEUTICS HAVE MORE RUN IN THIS TOTAL ADDRESSABLE MARKET STORY FOR WEIGHT LOSS DRUGS >>. YES, IF I COULD JUST PAUSE FOR A SECOND GUYS. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT, WE ARE TALKING TODAY ABOUT CONSUMER PRODUCTS COMPANY, A DRUG COMPANY, AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT A TECH COMPANY -- YOU THINK ABOUT ALL THREE OF THESE COMPANIES BEING DOMINANT BIG MOVERS IN THE MARKET. WHAT IS THE LAST TIME WE COULD SIT ON A SESSION LIKE THIS AND TALK ABOUT THREE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES THAT WERE NOT OVERWHELMED BY TECHNOLOGY? IT IS A STATEMENT OF WHERE INVESTORS ARE TODAY AND WHY YOU SHOULD THINK VERY CLOSELY ABOUT THE TYPES OF NAMES YOU USE. THIS IS AN EXAMPLE. VIKING IS NOW CHASING -- SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD'VE EXPECTED IT TO DO SIX MONTHS AGO. HERE THEY ARE WITH A VIABLE THIRD PRODUCT INTO THE BIG GLP ONE MARKET. WHY NOT? THIS COMPANY WILL NOT GO DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY, BECAUSE PFIZER WILL NEED TO BUY THAT AT SOME POINT. I'M SORRY >>. I JUST THINK THAT'S INTERESTING. >>. YES, I MEAN THESE GOP ONES. THINK BACK TO THE STOCK MARKET, BACK IN THE 18 -- AND EARLY 90S. MULTIPLE COMPETITORS, MULTIPLE DIFFERENT COMPOUNDS, PRETTY MUCH, ALL SUCCESSFUL. ONE LUMBERED COMES OUT WITH THE -- AND PFIZER HAS TO BUY THEM NOW. YOU HAVE THAT POTENTIAL FOR THIS BEING THE CASE IN -- AND WE DON'T HAVE TO KNOW HOW BIG THIS MARKET COULD BE. YOU SHOULD PROBABLY JUST BUY THIS AND FEEL COMFORTABLE THAT IT WILL NOT HAVE THE DOWNSIDE RISK OF A LOT OF THESE DIFFERENT COMPANIES >>. IT IS ALREADY UP 400% YEAR.","[146, 307]"

RECENT DEVELOPMENT -- AND YOU KNOW APPLE IS AMAZING BECAUSE. FOR A LONG TIME, WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THAT NEXT BIG PRODUCT, WHATEVER IT'S GOING TO BE, AND THEY'VE MANAGED TO CONVINCE PEOPLE THAT JUST THE, THE SERVICES AND ECOSYSTEM, AND JUST HOW APPLE IS A PART OF OUR EVERYDAY LIVES- THAT THAT SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO GIVE IT A PREMIUM VALUATION, BUT NOW YOU KNOW THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE A CAR. THERE'S BEEN CRITICISM THEY'RE BEHIND ON AI. IS THIS FINALLY A DAY OF RECKONING FOR YOU? DO YOU THINK? >>. I MEAN JOE. I THINK WHEN THEY FIRST CAME OUT WITH THE iPHONE, THEY WERE SPENDING LESS THAN $1 BILLION IN R & D- 3% OF REVENUE- NOW SPENDING $30 BILLION A YEAR. A REPORT YESTERDAY ON THIS CAR INVESTMENT SPENT $10 BILLION ALONE AND IT'S PRODUCING NO REVENUE. GROWTH RIGHT NOW. YOU MENTIONED SERVICES: THE SERVICES. IT'S A 10% GROWER THAT PROBABLY MODERATES. LOOK AT WHY SERVICES HAVE GROWN IN THE LAST COUPLE OF QUARTERS. IT'S NOT INNOVATION. IT'S PRICE INCREASES, REMINDING THE TELCO STOCKS I OWN. EXCUSE ME, I DON'T OWN. EXCUSE ME THAT I COVER, THAT YOU KNOW NO SUBSCRIBER GROWTH, SO INCREASE PRICE POSITIVE MUSTER UP LIKE A 1% OR 2% OF REVENUE AND YET INVESTORS STILL -- IT'S LESS NOW.

AS ALWAYS, WE'RE CURRENTLY IN THE MIDST OF A TRICKY PERIOD IN TERMS OF SMARTPHONE DEMAND GLOBALLY, CHINA, SOFT, OBVIOUSLY WHAT MATTERS. IN THE COMING MONTHS AND INTO NEXT YEAR YOU'RE LIKELY TO SEE BETTER GROWTH. YOU'LL SEE GENERATIVE AI FORM, PART OF THE EXPERIENCE WITH iPHONE 16.. IF WE STEP BACK AND THINK ABOUT WHAT THE COMPANY HAS DONE OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DECADES WITH THE iPOD, CLEARLY, iPHONE, iPAD, WEARABLES. IT'S ABOUT GETTING THE EXPERIENCE RIGHT. IT'S ABOUT INTEGRATED THE HARDWARE, THE SOFTWARE AND THE SERVICES. A LOT OF WHAT THEY WORK ON DOES NOT SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY. YOU MENTION THE CAR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT THEY DO PUT OUT. I THINK ARE DIFFERENTIATED USERS VALUE THAT, SEEING THAT IN THE CONTINUED GROWTH OF THE iPHONE, IN STALL FACE AND OTHER KEEP PIECE TO THE EQUATION, YOU HAVE A BIG VIBRANT ECOSYSTEM. THE REAL MAGIC HERE IS EMPOWERING MILLIONS OF DEVELOPERS TO WRITE APPLICATIONS. THEY CREATE VALUE FOR THEMSELVES. OBVIOUSLY, USERS GET VALUE AND THAT CONTRIBUTES TO APPLE'S GROWTH AND ULTIMATELY- EXCUSE ME- GENERATION OF ABOUT $100 BILLION OF FREE CASH FLOW A YEAR. WE CONTINUE TO LIKE THE NAME >> AND CONVINCED >>, I'M NOT DEFINITELY PUTTING A LOT ON THE SHOULDERS OF AI, WHICH WE HAVE NO INFORMATION TODAY. AND TALK ABOUT PAST DEVELOPMENTS. PEOPLE THOUGHT THEY'D HAVE A TV. TIM COOK SAID PULLING THE STRING ON THE TV. AND THE CAR, WHICH NEVER REALLY MATERIALIZED- IT'S NOT A BLIP IN iPHONES. THE REPLACEMENT CYCLE HAS BEEN LENGTHENING FOR A DECADE. I MEAN JUST TALK TO THE OPERATORS AND PEOPLE ARE HOLDING ON THTHEIR iPHONES LONGER TO THE COMPANY'S CREDIT. THEY'RE MAKING iPHONES BETTER, BATTERIES ARE LASTING LONGER. THE INCREMENTAL CHANGES ARE NOT INCREMENTAL ENOUGH TO GET FOLKS TO UPGRADE FAST ENOUGH. THE NARRATIVE RETURN TO GROWTH NEXT QUARTER- THAT'S THE NARRATIVE FROM THE BULL QUARTER: 5% GROWTH IN DECEMBER QUARTER PUSHED OUT TO THE FIRST QUARTER: 5% THE NEXT QUARTER: SAME THING'S HAPPENING IN JUNE. LOOK AT THE CONSENSUS ESTIMATE FOR JUNE. AND AGAIN, THE ANALYSTS ARE EXPECTING 5% GROWTH IN THE JUNE QUARTER.

RIGHT NOW TO TALK ABOUT TESLA AND WHAT IT SEEM, WHAT SEEMS TO BE FLAGGING INTEREST OVERALL IN PURE ELECTRIC VEHICLES IS MARK FIELDS, FORMER, PRESIDENT AND CEO OF FORD, ALSO A CNBC CONTRIBUTOR AND -- MARK, WHAT IS HAPPENING? I MEAN THERE'S STILL A LOT OF EV CARS THAT ARE SELLING, BUT THERE'S A LOT OF SUPPLY TO MEET THAT DEMAND AT THE SAME TIME, MAYBE THE MARKET KIND OF RETHINKING THE SUPPLY/DEMAND PICTURE >>. YEAH, I MEAN I WOULD CHARACTERIZE THIS. THIS IS A MARKET THAT'S GOING FROM OPTIMISTIC TO REALISTIC AND YOU'RE SEEING KIND OF WANING DEMAND LISTEN. GROWTH IS STILL THERE. RIGHT, WE KNOW THAT. YOU KNOW EV SALES HERE IN THE US PAST OVER A MILLION LAST YEAR UP ALMOST SLIGHTLY LESS THAN 50%. IT'S GROWING, BECKY, BUT NOT GROWING AT THE RATE OF WHICH EVERYBODY WAS EXPECTING. SO THAT'S WHY YOU'RE SEEING ALL THE --. >> WHAT'S THE NATIONAL SALES? IS IT, I DON'T KNOW, $12, 13 MILLION OF AUTOMOBILES? >>. YEAH, NATIONAL SALES. LAST YEAR WAS A LITTLE OVEROVERS: 15 MILLION VEHICLES, 1.1 MILLION, I THINK, A LITTLE OVER 7% SHARE. IT WAS UP FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, WHICH WAS ABOUT 5.5% SHARE. SO IT'S GROWING BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS IT'S NOT ACCELERATING THE PACE. ALL OF THE AUTOMAKERS EXPECTED WHY. YOU SEE NOW ALL AUTOMAKERS MAKING CHANGES, DELAYING PROGRAMS, SHIFTING OUT THE CONSTRUCTION OF PLANTS, THINGS OF THAT NATURE, BECAUSE, END OF THE DAY, THE CONSUMER HAS THE ISSUES AROUND THE COST. THEY HAVE ISSUES ARRANGED THE CHARGING ANXIETY, INSURANCE, AND A BIG ISSUE FOR CONSUMERS NOBODY REALLY TALKS ABOUT IS WITH THE REDUCTION IN PRICES YOU'VE SEEN HERE IN THE US AND AROUND THE WORLD. LET'S TAKE, HERE IN THE US, YOU KNOW, A MODEL. Y IS ABOUT 20% LESS COSTS PRICE THIS YEAR THAN LAST YEAR. THAT HAS HUGE IMPACTS ON RESIDUAL VALUES. IF YOU'RE A CONSUMER THAT OWNS AN EV RIGHT NOW, YOUR VEHICLE IS PROBABLY WORTH A LOT LESS THAT WEIGHS ON CONSUMERS AS THEY THINK ABOUT EVs GOING FORWARD >>. WHAT ABOUT COMPETITION COMING FROM PLACES LIKE CHINA, PHIL LeBEAU DOING AN EXCELLENT JOB REPORTING ON WHAT THIS MEANS FOR OTHER COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD? WHAT'S IT GOING TO MEAN FOR PRODUCERS HERE IN THE UNITED STATES >>. WELL, CHINA IS A REAL THREAT. I MEAN LET'S FACE IT. THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT, ABOUT 10, 12 YEARS AGO, SAID LISTEN. WE MISSED OUT ON DOMINATING INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES AND WE'RE GOING TO DOMINATE ON ELECTRIFICATION, GAVE A LOT OF INCENTIVES. GOVERNMENT GRANTS INCENTIVES AND SPENT A LOT OF MONEY PUTTING CAPACITY IN PLACE AND BUILDING EVs BUT COME UP QUICKLY IN QUALITY OF THOSE EVs. STARTED OUT AS STRATEGIC DECISION BY THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT TO DOMINATE, NOW TURNED BECKY INTO ONE. THAT'S TACTICAL BECAUSE THEY HAVE SO MUCH OVER CAPACITY RIGHT NOW IN CHINA. THEY SOLD A LITTLE OVER ABOUT 7 MILLION EVs IN CHINA LAST YEAR AND THEY HAVE CAPACITY FOR ALMOST 20 MILLION NOW EXPORTING FOR THE US. THERE'S HIGH TARIFFS RIGHT NOW BUT IF THEY DECIDE TO PUT PLANTS IN MEXICO, POTENTIALLY THEY CAN USE NAFTA TO BRING THOSE VEHICLES IN. YOU KNOW TARIFF-FREE AND THAT'S WHY I BELIEVE THE US GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO DO SOMETHING, NOT FOR PERMANENT BUT SOME PERIOD OF TIME TO GIVE THE WESTERN OR DOMESTIC AREA TIME TO CATCH UP BECAUSE OF THE UNLEVEL PLAYING FIELD >>. IF THEY DON'T WANT, DOES IT MEAN FOR THE BIG THREE AUTOMAKERS >> A LOT OF PAIN AND HURT AHEAD LISTEN. END OF THE DAY, IT'S NOT ONLY THE LABOR. THAT'S MUCH LESS FOR THESE CHINESE AUTO COMPANIES. YOU KNOW A LOT OF THE ELEMENTS FOR THE BATTERIES ARE MADE LOCALLY, SO IT'S LOWER PRICE FOR THEM AND SO IT'S GOING TO BE A REALLY HARD TIME. IF YOU THINK IT'S HARD NOW IT'S GOING TO GET HARDER. TESLA IS PROBABLY THE BEST POSITIONED OF THE WESTERN AUTOMAKERS, BECAUSE THEY ARE THE MOST VERTICALLY INTEGRATED. LOOK AT NEWCOMERS. RIVIAN YESTERDAY ANNOUNCED A NEW PRODUCT LOOK AT SOME OF THE PLAYERS THERE. THEY NEED SCALE TO SURVIVE AND I THINK THAT WILL PUT THEM AT THE MOST RISK IF THE CHINESE PRODUCTS COME THROUGH. >>. MARK QUICKLY NEW ADMINISTRATION. IF TRUMP ACTUALLY WINS, THE WHITE HOUSE WOULD PROBABLY ROLL BACK SOME OF THE REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE PUSHING AUTOMAKERS TO MAKE SO MANY OF THESE EVs. A BIG DIFFERENCE FOR THE BIG THREE BOTH ON PROFITABILITY AND WHAT THEIR FUTURE PLANS ARE >>. A BIG DEAL, YES, BECKY RIGHT NOW. EVEN THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION, ACCORDING TO RUMORS, IS LOOKING AT RELAXING THE EPA GUIDELINES BECAUSE LISTEN BY THEIR. -- LOOK AT CALIFORNIA, FOR EXAMPLE. CALIFORNIA AND 14 STATES THAT FOLLOW THEM BASICALLY SAID LISTEN. BY 2026, YOU HAVE TO HAVE 35% OF YOUR VEHICLES PURE EVs TO SELL IN THE STATE, IF NOT EVERY ONE. YOU GET AS $20,000 FINE.

A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO, WHEN WE WERE AT 175, BEFORE THE STOCK BASICALLY GOT CUT IN HALF, WHAT WAS THE VALUATION? IS THIS 175 MORE REASONABLE WHEN IT WAS THERE A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO? >> I THINK. SO WE ARE LOOKING AT THE ASSET THAT MATURES AT 28 TIMES FREE CASH FLOW VALUATION IS MORE REASONABLE. AMAZON WENT INTO THE MAJOR INVESTMENT CYCLE AS THEY AGGRESSIVELY INVESTED IN NEXT DAY AND SAME DAYAND SEVERAL HOUR DELIVERY THAT REALLY TRASHED ITS FREE CASH FLOW MARGINS.

I'M GOING TO GOOGLE SKUNKWORKS RIGHT NOW, WHEN IT COMES TO APPLE, GIVE ME A SENSE. HOW DO YOU VIEW THEM SCRAPPING THEIR PLANS TO CREATE A SELF-DRIVING CAR? SOME PEOPLE SEE IT AS HEY, THIS COULD HAVE BEEN THE INNOVATION PEOPLE WERE LOOKING FOR, AND POSSIBLY A CULTURE-SHIFTING PRODUCT AND IN OTHERS, SOME THINK THEY NEED TO FOCUS ON AI AND THE HEADSET, AND THAT'S WHERE THE REAL GROWTH IS. WHERE DO YOU LAND? >>. I THINK YOU HAVE TO READ BEHIND THE HEADLINE FOR THIS ONE OF ABOUT: THERE ARE CAMPS IN THE PRODUCT. WHY ARE THERE CAMPS IN THE PROJECT? I THINK IT'S BEEN A CORPORATE ISSUE THAT'S HELD APPLE BACK FROM BUILDING AN ELECTRIC CAR OR AUTONOMOUS CAR. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A DESIGN-LED PROCESS THAT, IN SOME CASES, HAD SENSORS THAT WERE REQUIRED FOR AUTONOMOUS DRIVING VERY DEEP WITHIN THE CAR AND LIMITING THEIR FIELD OF VIEW BECAUSE THE CAR WOULD LOOK BETTER. AND THEY SPENT YEARS ON THIS- $10 BILLION, ACCORDING TO SOME REPORTS- AND WEREN'T ABLE TO COME AWAY WITH A PRODUCT. TO ME, THEIR INABILITY TO SHIFT THIS THING IS THE REAL CONCERNING THING. INVESTORS SAYING THE CAR IS OFF THE TABLE AND THEY'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON THE SECONDARY. WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE APPLE? WHERE DOES THE CULTURE FALL SHORT THAT IT WAS UNABLE TO PRODUCE RESULTS HERE. >>. ONE THING I WANTED TO ASK ABOUT APPLE, AND THEN WE'LL TURN OUR ATTENTION BACK TO ALPHABET. I BOUNCED THIS OFF OF YOU. IT'S THE AFL-CIO INDEX FUNDS. THEY'RE ASKING APPLE TO PREPARE A TRANSPARENCY REPORT AND DISCLOSE ETHICAL GUIDELINES THAT APPLE HAS ADOPTED REGARDING THE USE OF AI. WHAT'S YOUR TAKE ON THIS? APPLE'S ACTUALLY ASKING SHAREHOLDERS TO VOTE NO ON THIS BECAUSE THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT REVEALING SOME OF THEIR COMPETITIVE POSITION >> YEAH, I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT ASK. WE'RE GOING TO START TO SEE EVEN MORE SCANDALS AROUND THESE AI GENERATION TOOLS BECAUSE THEY SPEND SO MUCH TIME ACTING ON THEIR OWN, FORMING THEIR OWN OPINIONS. I THINK, WITHOUT TRANSPARENCY, IT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH FOR USERS TO TRUST THE COMPANIES. APPLE TRUST IS REALLY THE CORE THING THAT YOU'RE SELLING ALONGSIDE, OBVIOUSLY FUNCTIONAL DEVICES.

LIKE YOU MENTIONED, I THINK APPLE IS ASKING VOTERS TO TURN IT DOWN. I DON'T THINK THERE'S A LOT OF CHANCE THAT THIS IS GOING TO PASS, BUT MAYBE IT WILL SET OFF ALARM BELLS INSIDE APPLE WHERE THEY SAY: IF THEY'RE GOING TO SHIP SOMETHING, MAYBE THERE SHOULD BE A TRANSPARENCY REPORT >>. LET'S COME FULL CIRCLE. I WANTED TO TAKE YOU DOWN THE ROAD TO AM. WE'VE SEEN SHAREHOLDERS ASKING APPLE TO REVEAL TRANSPARENCY ETHICS. WHAT DO YOU THINK GOOGLE HAS TO DO TO REGAIN THAT TRUST WHEN IT COMES TO NOT ONLY CUSTOMERS BUT INVESTORS, STOCKS, MOVED INTO THE NEGATIVE TERRITORY FOR THE YEAR, FOLLOWING SOME OF THESE ISSUES? >>. ABSOLUTELY WELL. THEY'RE TALKING INTERNALLY ABOUT STRUCTURAL CHANGES- RIGHT, I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT. WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE PROCESS? IT'S NOT JUST THE MISTAKE ITSELF BUT IT'S THE ORGANIZATION AT ISSUES THAT LED US TO THIS MOMENT THAT GOOGLE SHOULD REALLY BE CONCERNED ABOUT. THEY HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A BETTER PROCESS. THE BEST WAY TO SPEAK TO INVESTORS AND CUSTOMERS AND USERS AND EMPLOYEES IS TO SHIP SOME PRODUCTLESS THEY CAN BE PROUD OF. WE KNOW THEY. THEY HAVE A MODELLE, GEMINI AND GEMINI 1.5.. THAT SHOULD BE ON PAR. WHICH IS THE MODEL FROM OPENAI. THEY HAVE TO SHOW, WHEN THE PRODUCTS COME OUT, THAT THIS MODEL IS GOOD, AND THESE MISTAKES THAT THEY'VE MADE IN THE RECENT PAST HAVE REALLY DONE A DISSERVICE TO GOOGLE IN TERMS OF ITS OPPORTUNITY AND ABILITY TO SHOW US THAT IT HAS THE PRODUCT CHOPS TO PUT IT ALONGSIDE THE OPENAIs FOR INSTANCE AND REALLY FACTOR IT IN >>. SOME OF THESE WERE QUITE CONTROVERSIAL. ALEX, I WANT TO ASK YOU, REFERRING TO THE REQUEST AT THE APPLE SHAREHOLDER MEETING, DOES ALPHABET NEED TO RELEASE A REPORT CREATING MORE TRANSPARENCY? HOW ARE THEIR TOOLS COMING UP WITH THESE RESULTS, WHAT'S GOING ON AND WHO'S INVOLVED WITH THESE PROCESSES? >>. THEIR JOB WAS GETTING YOU FROM POINT A TO POINT B IN THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY POSSIBLE AND SATISFYING. SOME CURIOSITY, RIGHT. NOW, WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS SUGGESTING THE WHOLE WEB LIKE CONSERVATIONAL AI OR, WHEN IT COMES TO AI, BOTS. YOU DIDN'T NEED THE TRANSPARENCY. ALL THE ACTION WAS HAPPENING ON THE WEB ITSELF.

ALL OF A SUDDEN, WE SAID OVER THE LAST THREE MONTHS REFORMING THE BLUE CHIP NAMES SEEMINGLY 3000 TIMES A DAY. >>. THERE ARE THREE ISSUES FOR BANKS, THE THREE R'S THAT WOULD BE RIGHT: RECESSION AND REGULATION. EACH ONE OF THOSE IS LESS BAD WHEN IT COMES TO INTEREST RATES. YOU CANNOT UNSEE THE DECEMBER FED PIVOT. IT SEEMS A LITTLE BIT LESS LIKELY THAN BEFORE. REGULATION SEEMS LIKE IT WILL BE DIALED BACK A LITTLE BIT >>. YOU POSED THE QUESTION RHETORICALLY AT THE TOP, SUGGESTING WELL. WHY WERE THEY DOWN SO MUCH BEFORE, AS IF THEY DID NOT DESERVE TO BE, BUT THEN YOU SAID WERE GIVEN. WHERE INTEREST RATES WERE. THAT WAS A SUBSTANTIAL HEADWIND, WITH WORRIES ABOUT WHAT THE RAMIFICATIONS OF ALL OF THAT ARE GOING TO BE FOR THE ECONOMY MAYBE. WE NOW HAVE A ROADMAP TO LOWER RATES, SO THE STOCKS ARE WORKING. IT SEEMS PRETTY CUT AND DRY >>. I THINK TO SOME DEGREE. IT IS THE THIRD YEAR IN A ROW WHERE THE INDUSTRY SHOULD HAVE LOWER EARNINGS. YOU'RE LOOKING AT EARNINGS GROWTH FOR THE BANKS TO BE DOWN 20% OVER THREE YEARS FOR THE END OF THIS YEAR. AFTER THAT WE SEE EARNINGS UP BY ONE THIRD IN 2025 AND 2026.. YOU WILL SEE A HOCKEY STICK TYPE PROJECTION OF EARNINGS STARTING LATER THIS YEAR. I THINK THAT THE STOCK MARKET IS NOT GOING TO WAIT >>. SO WHY DO YOU HAVE SUCH DIFFERENT VIEWS, LET'S SAY, OF JPMORGAN VERSUS MORGAN STANLEY? JP MORGAN IS PART OF THE LIST OF YOUR NAMES THAT YOU FOLLOW WHERE YOU HAVE OVER WEIGHT RATINGS AND LOFTY PRICE TARGETS TO GO WITH. THAT IS EQUAL WEIGHT. WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE WAY YOU VIEW BOTH OF THOSE STOCKS >>? BOTH OF THEM HAVE PERFORMED EXCEPTIONALLY WELL. MORGAN STANLEY IS SIMPLY PRICING AT A LOT MORE GROWTH AT A TIME OF DECELERATING IN FLOWS OF WITH THE WEALTH MANAGEMENT BUSINESS AND FRANKLY FLAT TO SLIGHTLY LOWER MARKET SHARE IN THEIR INSTITUTIONAL SECURITIES BUSINESS. ON THE OTHER HAND, JP MORGAN IS A CLEAR MARKET SHORT -- GAIN OR OVER THE LAST ONE, THREE AND FIVE YEARS. I WOULD SAY MARKET SHARE AND STOCK VALUATION DIFFERENTIATES. THEM DON'T LEAVE OFF CITY GROUP, WHICH IS MY NUMBER ONE- MY NUMBER ONE. PICK JP MORGAN IS MY NUMBER TWO. PICK, THAT IS A WORST IN CLASS STORY BECOMING LESS BAD. MORGAN STANLEY WAS A GREAT STORY. THAT IS BECOMING LESS GREAT >>. THAT MAKES ME WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE LEADERSHIP OF THESE PARTICULAR INSTITUTIONS. BOTH THE JOB THE JANE FRASER HAS DONE IN REINVENTING- I'M NOT SURE. THAT'S TOO STRONG OF A WORD. NEVERTHELESS, SHE IS DONE A LOT OF WORK. THAT HAS GOTTEN APPLAUSE FROM INVESTORS. IS THAT FAIR TO SAY? JAMES GORMAN LEAVING MORGAN STANLEY? YOU FEEL LIKE THIS IS A PROVEN MOMENT FOR HIM. IS IT ANY REASON WHY YOU ARE A LITTLE BIT IFFY ON THE NAME? >>. TED PICK HAS BEEN PART OF THE TEAM FOR THE LAST DECADE, REALLY TRANSFORMING MORGAN STANLEY INTO A HIGHER RETURN, MORE RESILIENT FIRM. I DON'T THINK THAT HE DOES HAVE SOMETHING TO PROVE IN THE SHORT TERM. I THINK, OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS, IT'S TOUGH COMPS FOR TED PICK COMPARED TO THE LAST THREE OR 15 YEARS >>. BUT THERE IN THE CROWN JEWEL BUSINESS, RIGHT BUT THEY WERE POSITIONED IN WEALTH MANAGEMENT, WHICH WAS THIS GREAT BUSINESS TO BEGIN? THEY SAW IT BEFORE MOST. ISN'T THAT A WINNER. WHY WOULDN'T STILL BE? >>. WEALTH MANAGEMENT IS A BATTLEGROUND. IT MIGHT HAVE ONE BANK THAT DOESN'T LOOK TO WEALTH MANAGEMENT AS A PLACE TO GROW MORGAN STANLEY'S INFLOWS. THEY GO VERY HOT. THEY WENT TO THE DOUBLE DIGITS. THEY'VE NOW BEEN GROWING THREE TO 4% INFLOWS. THEY ARE PRETAX PROFIT MARGIN AT 30%. NOW THEY'RE LOOKING AT 25%. IT IS GOING FROM REALLY GOOD TO GREAT TO JUST NOT QUITE AS GREAT >>. SO YOU WATCHED THE DIMON INTERVIEW TODAY ON CNBC. IT WAS A GREAT TIME TO CATCH UP WITH HIM. ANYTIME YOU START TALKING TO HIM ABOUT REGULATIONS. HE SITS UP IN HIS SEAT, VOICE PICKS UP A LITTLE BIT. HE WAS ASKED ABOUT THE IMPACT OF REGULATIONS ON LENDING THE MASSIVE GROWTH IN PRIVATE CREDIT, COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE. WHAT POSSIBLE ISSUES ARE DOWN THE ROAD. IS IT BECAUSE OF ALL OF THAT? I WANT YOU TO LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAID ON THE OTHER SIDE, JAMIE DIMON, ON BANK REGULATION. >>. THANKS FOR BEING PUSHED OUT OF A WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT BUSINESSES. IF THAT'S WHAT THE REGULARS WANT, THEN DO IT. IT SHOULD BE DONE WITH THE FOURTH ONE, NOT ACCIDENTALLY. THERE ARE SOME NEGATIVES. I THINK THAT IF YOU HAVE A MAJOR RECESSION, YOU'RE PROBABLY SEEING SOME ISSUES IN THAT CREDIT. IS IT SYSTEMIC OR NOT? I DON'T REALLY THINK SO THERE MIGHT BE WAYS WHERE WE COULD GO IN TODAY. >> HOW DO YOU VIEW THAT? >> I THINK HE USED A WORD THAT REALLY GOT JAMIE DIMON BOILING, AND THAT WORD IS REGULATION. WHEN I LOOK AT JP MORGAN AND THE REGULATORY PROPOSALS, I AM LOOKING AT A 60 BILLION DOLLAR DIFFERENCE IN THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL THAT THEY HAVE TO HOLD. I ESTIMATE THAT EQUATES TO $2 OF EARNINGS PER SHARE. IT'S ABOUT 25 POINTS OUT OF STOCK PRICE. SO THESE PROPOSALS DON'T GO THROUGH. THAT IS A 25 POINT DIFFERENCE IN STOCK PRICE BASED ON THE EARNINGS THEY CAN GENERATE OFF THE 60 BILLION OF EXTRA CAPITAL. HE'S BATTLEGROUND WITH REGULATORS RIGHT NOW, ALONG WITH OTHERS. HE IS FIGHTING FOR THE INVESTORS AND FIGHTING FOR THAT EXTRA $2 OF EARNINGS PER SHARE AFTER 25 POINTS IN THE STOCK PRICE >>. SO IF THEY DO GO THROUGH, DO YOU NEED TO RETHINK YOUR STOCK PRICES AND YOUR RATINGS? >> NOPE, I'M ASSUMING THAT IT GOES THROUGH RIGHT. NOW I HAVE THE MUCH HIGHER CAPITAL.",[34]

THAT LOOKS AT YEARS IN WHICH JANUARY AND FEBRUARY ARE UP AND YOU END THE YEAR WITH THE SECTORS THAT GOT YOU THERE CONTINUING TO OUTPERFORM. DO YOU EXPECT THE OPPOSITE? >>. I THINK IT'S ALL CONSISTENT RIGHT. WE'VE BEEN SAYING THE BIG SEVEN, OR MAG SEVEN, WOULD BECOME IDIOSYNCRATIC. THAT'S HAPPENING. YOU STOP THINKING OF THEM AS MUCH AS A COHORT AS YOU HAVE IN THE PAST AND YOU START LOOKING AT THE OTHER EVIDENCE FOR BROADENING AND SECTOR DYNAMIC SO FAR THIS YEAR AND SEEING HEALTH CARE DO WELL. INDUSTRIALS, FINANCIALS- ALL EVIDENCE OF THIS. THESE ARE AREAS WHERE WE EXPECT THAT EARNINGS FOLLOW THROUGH, SHOULD UNFOLD, AS WE GET INTO THE BACK HALF OF THE YEAR >>. FOR ALL OF LAST YEAR, THE MARKET WAS CRAVING LOWER RATES. WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THE RELATIONSHIP IS KIND OF BROKEN DOWN. TODAY IS A GOOD EXAMPLE. THERE'S BUYING YIELDS ARE MOVING LOWER AND EQUITIES ARE NOW MOVING TO THE LOWS OF THE SESSION. WHAT HAPPENED TO WANTING THOSE LOWER TREASURY YIELDS AND THE WEAKER DATA >>? FROM OUR PERCH, WE WANT LOWER 10-YEAR NOMINALS TO SUPPORT THE VALUATIONS AROUND THE GROWTH PART OF THE MARKET. WE'RE NAVIGATING WHEN AND IF WE'RE GOING TO GET TO THE PIVOT, WE'RE PRESUMING MIDDLE PART OF THE YEAR. WE NEED THAT AT SOME LEVEL TO SUPPORT SOME OF THE VIEW ON THE SECTOR, SUCH AS FINANCIALS BUT ALL TOLD, WHAT'S HAPPENED RIGHT NOW, IN OUR OPINION, IS: YOU HAVE A FOMO THING KICKING IN GROWTH DRIVER VIA AI. THAT'S PULLING THE MEGA CAP GROWTH COHORT ALONG, AND WE'RE SEEING FOLLOW THROUGH FROM AN ETF FLOW PERSPECTIVE FUTURES POSITION. ALL OF THAT SUGGESTING THAT I THINK THERE'S A BIG RUSH TO KIND OF GET ON THIS PARADE AFTER BEING ON THE SIDELINES OF THIS VIEW, THAT CASH IS AN ALTERNATIVE FOR THE BETTER PART OF LAST YEAR. >>. HOW LONG DO THOSE KINDS OF PARADES LAST? >>. THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION, DAVID. I THINK IT GOES AS LONG AS WE GET FUNDAMENTAL SUPPORT. WE'VE BEEN ARGUING A COUPLE THINGS HERE. IF YOU LOOK AT THE PEG RATIOS IN THE BIG SEVEN, THEY'VE COME DOWN. WE ARE BEGINNING TO SEAT EARNINGS FOLLOW THROUGH. WE LIKE TO THROW OUT THE DATA FROM A YEAR AGO TO NOW: '24 GROWTH EXPECTATIONS.

SO, EVEN IF YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT CARS, IS THIS A GOOD MOVE FOR APPLE? IS IT GOOD NEWS FOR TESLA WITH US TONIGHT? IS DEEPWATER ASSET MANAGEMENT AND --? ROSS GERBER, JEAN, YOU SAY YOU ARE URPRISED, BUT I WONDER WHY. WHOEVER THOUGHT THAT AN APPLE CAR WAS A GOOD IDEA IN THE FIRST PLACE? >>. I THINK APPLE THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD IDEA, AND I THINK THAT THEY HAVE A HISTORY OF REDEFINING, REIMAGINING PROJECT CATEGORIES THAT WERE GETTING OFF THE GROUND. SO THE AMOUNT THEY WERE INVESTING WAS ABOUT $1 BILLION PER YEAR, MOST OF THAT COMING OVER THE PAST THREE OR FOUR YEARS IN TIM COOK FAMOUSLY SAID IN 2017 THAT AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES ARE THE MOTHER OF ALL AI PROJECTS. IF YOU LISTEN AND WATCH WHAT THEY ARE DOING, THEY WANTED TO DO THIS, THIS WAS A GOAL AND OF COURSE, THEY HAVE NOW SHIFTED DIRECTIONS. THAT IS WHAT SURPRISED ME. I HAVE PUT THE ODDS OF THIS IT 50-50 THAT THIS WOULD COME OUT 50% CHANCE. I AM FAMOUSLY WRONG FOR PREDICTING APPLE TELEVISION. THAT GOT KILLED IN 2017 AND THAT 2017 EPISODE REMINDED ME. BECAUSE APPLE IS WORKING ON SOMETHING DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT WILL SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY, AND NOW WE ADD THE APPLE CAR TO THAT CATEGORY. >>. YOU ARE TOO HARD ON YOURSELF. MY APPLE TV DOES EXIST- NOT THE PHYSICAL TV BUT THE BOX. BUT WE WILL GIVE YOU PASS ON THAT ONE. GENE ROSS LISTEN, APPLE COULD HAVE PROBABLY OWNED TESLA 5 TO 10 YEARS AGO. MAYBE THEY COULD STILL TAKE A PASS AT IT. WHO KNOWS WHAT IS YOUR TAKE? >>. I WAS WITH GENE WITH APPLE TV. YOU KNOW I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE THAT IN RELEASING TV, BUT I KNEW THEY WERE NEVER GOING TO DO A CAR. YOU KNOW, BEING AN EARLY TESLA INVESTOR AND KNOWING WHERE THEY WERE AT, AND I HAD DONE MANY INTERVIEWS BACK AS FAR AS 2015 TALKING ABOUT APPLE TAKING A STAKE IN TESLA AND WHEN TESLA WAS IN TROUBLE IN 2018 AND NEEDED MONEY. SUPPOSEDLY THERE WAS A CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE TWO THAT TIM DOES NOT REMEMBER, BUT THAT LACK OF MEMORY REALLY COST THEM HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR APPLE SHAREHOLDERS. IF YOU WANT TO TAKE A STAKE IN TESLA AFTER TIME, AND JUST THE SAME- WE SEE THEM IN THIS BUSINESS BUT THEY DON'T WANT TO BE IN THIS BUSINESS AND THEY'VE MADE A CLEAR COMMITMENT TO VISION PRO AND MOVING THIS TEAM OVER TO AI IS THE SMARTEST THING THEY CAN DO. THIS IS A GOOD MOVE FOR APPLE. >>. WE GO BACK TO YOU, ROSS. WE ARE JUST GOING TO HAVE A LITTLE FUN TUESDAY WORST NIGHT OF THE WEEK. ANY CHANCE APPLE AT 2.8 TRILLION IN MARKET CAP COULD TRY TO PURCHASE TESLA AT $700 BILLION IN MARKET CAP, OR IS THAT COMPLETELY INSANE? >>. NOT WHAT, THIS FTC? THEY WON'T EVEN LET TWO BAD GROCERY STORES, BIRDS, LET ALONE SOMETHING AS DOMINANT AS THAT. WE HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL SOMETHING PEAKS THERE. BUT IN THEORY, I THINK THE BIGGER ISSUE IS THAT TIM COOK AND ELON MUSK ARE LIKE OIL AND WATER. THEY WOULD NEVER WORK TOGETHER EVER, OKAY, CLEARLY EVER. SO IT WOULD HAVE TO BE ONE OF THE OTHER IN CHARGE AND THE OTHER NOT BEING INVOLVED, IF THAT WAS EVER GOING TO HAPPEN. >>. WE KNOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT LOVES ELON MUSK, SO YOU NEVER KNOW, ROSS, MAYBE THEY COULD TAKE A PASS. >>. THE SHOW JUST STARTED. IT'S TOO EARLY FOR THE SARCASM. >>. GENE MUNSTER, APPLE CARS ARE HARD PHONES. THE THING WITH YOUR EYEBALLS THEY ARE DOING NOW, OKAY, THOSE ARE HARD CARS ARE A DIFFERENT ANIMAL. IF YOU ARE AN APPLE SHAREHOLDER, MANY OF OUR LISTENERS ARE SHOULD THEY BE HAPPY ABOUT THIS NEWS. >>. I THINK THEY SHOULD BE DISAPPOINTED. AND PART OF IT IS THAT APPLE IS A TECH COMPANY. IT'S THE REVENUE OF THIS YEAR AND TO GROW A TOP LINE AND TO GROW THE BUSINESS, YOU HAVE TO GET INTO SOME BIG MARKETS. VISION PRO HAS SOME POTENTIAL BUT THAT WAS KIND OF THE SHINING OPPORTUNITY RELATED TO THE CAR. IF THEY GET 10% OF THE AUTOMOTIVE MARKET, THAT WOULD GROW THE TOP LINE BY 60%. YOU CAN SET ASIDE THE EARNINGS QUESTION, BUT I I UNDERSTAND THAT MOST INVESTORS THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS A LOW PROBABILITY. THAT IS REFLECTED IN THE STOCK TRADE TODAY BUT ULTIMATELY, I AM DISAPPOINTED. I THINK APPLE COULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING REALLY SPECIAL WHEN IT COMES TO AUTOMOTIVE -- >>. SORRY TO INTERRUPT GENE BUT TO THE POINT I JUST MADE WITH ROSS THE QUESTION RATHER, MAYBE THERE IS A CHANCE. YOU ARE SAYING THERE'S A CHANCE. APPLE IS ABANDONING INNING ITS OWN EVER BECAUSE MAYBE WANT TO TAKE A PASS, MAYBE NOT AT TESLA, WHICH IS MASSIVE, BUT MAYBE AT RIVIAN, INSTEAD OF BUILD, JUST PURCHASE >>. I THINK THE RIVIAN THAT LINES UP 10, $12 BILLION MARKET CAP, DEFINITELY MORE DOABLE, AND I THINK IT DOES LINE UP. APPLE COULD DO THIS AND I THINK THAT THAT WOULD GET THEM INTO THAT BIGGER MARKET.

YOU'VE TRIMMED MORE. I THINK YOU WERE WITH ME LAST WEEK AND SAID YOU WERE TRIMMING SOME. NOW YOU'RE BACK TRIMMING EVEN MORE OF BROADCOM. BUT YOU DID THAT AHEAD OF THE NUMBER. >>. YEAH, BELIEVE IT OR NOT, THIS IS THE SECOND TIME OF THE WEEK WE'VE BEEN SELLING BROADCOM. I THINK STEPHANIE COVERED IT PERFECTLY. THE DIVERSIFICATION BEHIND BROADCOM IS THE REASON WE LOVE THE STOCK, LOVE THE COMPANY. WE MAINTAIN A VERY SMALL POSITION IN IT. WE WERE DIGGING DEEPER INTO THE NUMBERS. THE REVENUES WERE EXPECTED TO BE $38 BILLION PREVIOUSLY. THAT GOT JUMPED UP TO $50 BILLION- EXPLOSIVE GROWTH, DEFINITELY NICE THINGS. ON THE CONFERENCE CALL ABOUT AI AND INTERNALLY HERE WE SAID: BUT WHAT IF THEY DON'T DOED $50 BILLION? WHAT IF THEY DO $60 BILLION? AND THEN WE JUST BROKE IT DOWN TO SALES PER SHARE. THE FLOAT HAS BEEN INCREASING, SO IT COMES OUT TO ABOUT $130 PER SHARE IN SALES. OKAY, LET'S TAKE A RIDICULOUS MULTIPLE TEN TIMES SALES AND THAT GETS YOU TO A $1,300 SHARE PRICE. HISTORICALLY, IT'S TRADED CLOSER TO SEVEN TIMES, WHICH IS BACK AT $900.. NOW I AGREE WITH JOE AND STEPHANIE: THERE SHOULD BE AN AI PREMIUM. BUT IF YOU'RE TALKING TEN TIMES, FORWARD SALES OF $60 BILLION, NOT EVEN $50 BILLION. THEY'RE PROJECTING WITH THE STREET IN PRETTY MUCH AGREEMENT. WE'RE LOOKING AT A STOCK THAT'S FAIRLY PRICED. SO FOR THAT REASON, WE'VE BEEN EXITING THE POSITION. STEPHANIE'S POINT UP: 51% IN THREE MONTHS. WHEN DO I EVER GET A STOCK THAT GETS TO DO THAT IN OUR WORLD? SO WE'RE TAKING SOME PROFITS.

JAMES, WE'VE TALKED ALL KINDS OF TECH DURING OUR SPAN TOGETHER AND YOUR TIME ON CNBC. TAKE US THROUGH THE AMAZON STORY IN YOUR MINDAND, WHY THERE IS STILL MORE UPSIDE LEFT AFTER A BIG RUN >>. YEAH, I THINK THE AMAZON STORY IS SUPER SIMPLE. IT'S THE E-COMMERCE OF RETAIL WILL CONTINUE TO GO FROM ANALOG TO DIGITAL AND OVER 50% OF THOSE DOLLARS ARE CAPTURED BY AMAZON. AND THAT'S THE TOP LINE STORY. AND I THINK WHAT'S UNDERAPPRECIATED AND CONTINUES TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERAPPRECIATE. SIDE THE EARNINGS POWER OF THIS COMPANY. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE OPTIMIZATION THEY'VE DONE ON THE FULFILLMENT SIDE AND THE OPPORTUNITIES OF THE INCREMENTAL MARGINS AFFORDED FROM ADVERTISING, ALL OF THESE WILL FLOW DOWN TO THE BOTTOM LINE AND WE JUST THINK THAT THE CURRENT STREET ESTIMATES AREN'T ESTIMATING THAT, WITH EARNINGS GROWING AT MORE THAN 50%, IT'S A CONSTRUCTIVE BET TO MAKE >>. JAMES, IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE MANY OF US HAVE BEEN WATCHING, COVERING, EITHER FROM A BUSINESS OR NEWSSTANDPOINT WE USED TO TALK ABOUT THE E-CO, E-COMMERCE ANYMORE.

THAT'S A GOOD POINT. IT TRADES THAT WAY RIGHT ON THE AWS SIDE. I THINK THAT THE STORY WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE SAME: GROWTH RATES HAVE BOTTOMED OUT. WE WENT THROUGH THE MASSIVE OPTIMIZATION CYCLES THAT COMPANIES ARE DOING OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS TO TRY TO RIGHT SIZE THE CLOUD SPEND AND WE THINK THOSE DAYS ARE BEHIND US. YOU LOOK AT ANY OF THE COMMENTS, FROM SATYA NADELLA TO ANY OF THE OTHER CLOUD BOSSES THAT -- THE CLOUD-BASED COMPANY BOSSES THAT THOSE DAYS ARE BEHIND US, WHICH MEANS THOSE RATES HAVE BOTTOMED OUT AND WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET THOSE HIGH, INCREMENTAL BOSSES, AS NEW DOLLARS FLOW INTO THE CLOUD AND WE WERE AT 12% AND 13% LAST QUARTER AND WE THINK IT WILL JUST CONTINUE TO INCREMENTALLY GROW HIGHER FROM HERE.

IN THE PAST QUARTER, IT EXPANDED AGAIN TO 5.8.. AND THEY'RE ON THEIR PATH TO GETTING TO 6%, WHICH IS WHAT THEY HISTORICALLY HAVE DONE. ALL BECAUSE OF THINGS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT: INVENTORY FELL- ANOTHER 12% WHILE REVENUES ROSE 1.7.. THIS IS THE KEY. THIS IS THE FIFTH STRAIGHT QUARTER WHERE SALES OUTGREW INVENTORY.

SAME STORE SALES. IT WILL BE A SLOW RECOVERY, BUT THEY'RE GIVING US A PATHWAY TO GET TO FLAT TO 2%. SAME STORE SALES FOR THE FULL YEAR, WHICH SUGGESTS THAT THEY HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE TRAFFIC TRENDS. THEY'RE SEEING AS WELL AS EASY COMPARISONS FOR THIS YEAR IN TERMS OF EARNINGS.

THE STOCK PURE WEDDING AND SOARING HIGHER, PLEDGING TO A CLEAR LINE OF SUPPORT. A STUNNING REVERSAL: GLASS, HALF-FULL, CONTINUED. WHY? I THINK IT'S BECAUSE THESE OPTIMISTIC REALISTS ARE EMBRACING EFFICIENCY, WITH PROJECTS GOING NOWHERE GETTING SHUTTERED, ESPECIALLY IF THEY NOW NEED TO INVEST IN AND GENERATIVE AI EVEN, AS I BELIEVE THAT APPLE WOULD FIND THAT PARTICULAR COMPARISON ODIOUS. THE MARKET FOR ELECTRIC CARS IS WORSE, AS WE DON'T HAVE CARS THAT CAN BE CHARGED AS QUICKLY AS HE CAN FILL UP A PROVERBIAL GAS TANK, AND WE HAVE RANGE ANXIETY. WITHOUT THAT CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE, APPLE COULD BE MAKING A PRODUCT WITHOUT A MARKET. NOW THEY HAVE THE VISION PRO, WHICH I KNOW IS EXPENSIVE. BUT BEAR WITH ME FOR A SECOND. IT'S GOING TO HAVE A LARGER MARKET AS PEOPLE DEVELOP, AND NOT JUST IN THE EARLY ADOPTER SET. GO TRY IT ON, I LOVE IT. OR TAKE THE BRAND-NEW SPORTS APP. THE MORE PROGRAMS YOU CAN PUT ON THAT AND NOT SLOW IT DOWN, THE MORE YOU WILL WANT TO DOWNLOAD IT AND ULTIMATELY PAY FOR IT. THAT APP COULD BE THE GATEWAY FOR'S WARTS FOR -- FOR A DEVICE THAT DOESN'T REALLY HAVE SPORTS, AND IT IS CERTAINLY MORE IMPORTANT THAN AN ELECTRIC CAR- I'M NOT AGAINST ELECTRIC CARS- AND WE NEED TO BE SURE WE ARE GOING THAT DIRECTION ULTIMATELY.

AS FOR APPLE, WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT OTHER THINGS THEY ARE WORKING ON, SO IT'S HARD TO SAY WHAT IS EFFICIENT FOR THEM. I THINK IT'S SMART OF THEM TO SHIFT THAT MONEY FROM EV TO AI. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE HAS SYNERGY WITH EVERYTHING ELSE THEY MAKE. WHEREAS AN ELECTRIC CAR WOULD BE ITS OWN SEPARATE THING IN A MARKET WHERE THEY HAVE ZERO EXPOSURE. I COULD DO WITHOUT THAT. WHAT WILL HE REALLY WANT TO SEE YOU- AND I KNOW I'M GOING ON THIS THERE- SOME SORT OF ORDER AT GOOGLE. I DON'T EVEN WANT TO CALL IT ALPHABET ANYMORE, BECAUSE THEY NEVER CHANGE THE SYMBOL.

ABOUT THIS, GOOGLE HAD AT ONE TIME TWO DIFFERENT HEALTH INITIATIVES GOING ON NOT KIDDING. THEY STARTED ONE IN 2018, WHO, RAN BY DAVID FEINBERG, WHO THEN MOVED ON TO DISSOLVE THE DIVISION. WHY NOT?

HE GOT NOTHING FOR THE LOSING DIVISIONS. IT'S BAD BIG DEAL. I BELIEVE SELF DRIVING CARS ARE THE WAY OF THE FUTURE. IT'S EASIER TO SAY THAT AND SAY IT ISN'T. I THINK ELECTRIC CARS ARE THE WAY OF THE FUTURE, BUT THEY ARE NOT THE WAY OF THE PRESENT AND WHILE. IT WOULD BE A SHAME TO SEE THEM HAVE A FIASCO. IT SHOWS US THAT THERE ARE REAL SAFETY ISSUES THAT HAVEN'T BEEN RESOLVED FOR DRIVERLESS CARS AND NOT JUST BLACK ICE. HOW MUCH MONEY HAS BEEN SPENT, HOW MUCH MORE WILL BE.

THERE HAS TO BE SOME POINT WHERE THEY PUSH THROUGH A YEAR OF EFFICIENCY AND WE FINALLY FIND OUT HOW MANY DIFFERENT DIVISIONS AND HOW MANY LAYERS AREN'T PERUSING ANYTHING, LIKE THE NFL SUNDAY TICKET. JUST LYING FALLOW IS THE UNVARNISHED TRUTH THAT NO ONE WANTS TO SAY BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID. IT'S STOCK WOULD BE DRAMATICALLY HIGHER IF APPLE DID WHAT THEY DID TODAY BY BLOOMBERG.

AND BIRKENSTOCK. ON DECK HERE WITH OUR TRADE IS COURTNEY GARCIA, SENIOR WEALTH ADVISOR AND CNBC CONTRIBUTOR. GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE. WE WILL START WITH PARAMOUNT. SHARES ARE ON PACE FOR FOURTH STRAIGHT NEGATIVE WEEK. OUR OWN, ALEX SHERMAN, REPORTED THAT THEY ENDED TAKEOVER TALKS. A STRATEGIC BUDGET COULD BE IN THE CARDS AS THE STREAMING ADS DECELERATE. COURTNEY, WHAT WOULD YOU DO WITH PARAMOUNT? THE MOMENTUM HAS BEEN NEGATIVE >>. I THINK THAT IS A REASON YOU WANT TO LOOK AT THIS. IT IS UNDER SELLING PRESSURE. A LOT OF THE STREAMERS HAVE GONE THROUGH A TOUGH PERIOD. THE EARNINGS MAY NOT BE AT THE POINT OF THE HEIGHT OF LINEAR TV, BUT THEY ARE LEANING INTO THE STREAMING SERVICES. THE KEY IS THE SPORTS CONTENT. THEY HAVE NFL RIGHTS AND MARCH MADNESS THROUGH 2030.. THE WAY THEY ARE BUNDLING THE SERVICES, THEY WILL HAVE ADDITIONAL CUSTOMER RETENTION RATES. IT IS HARD TO CANCEL WHEN YOU LIKE NICKELODEON AND YOU ARE WATCHING SHOWTIME AND SPORTS AND ALL OF THAT IS TOGETHER. THEY ARE LEANING INTO THAT AS A LONGTERM STRATEGY. THIS IS SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN BURNING THROUGH CASH BUT THEY ARE FINALLY POSITIVE IN CASH FLOW. THEY ARE IN THE HEADLINES WITH THE M AND A ACTIVITY. YOU ARE SEWING THAT FALL THROUGH BUT I THINK IT LEADS TO THE ARGUMENT THAT IT IS UNDERVALUED AND MAYBE SOMETHING TO LOOK FOR IN THE LONG RUN. >>. ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE ON TO HP INC.

THERE IS ABOUT A THREE YEAR CYCLE ON PCs. NOW EVERYONE NEEDS TO UP GRADE 2024. LOOKS LIKE INCREASED DEMAND AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT HP WILL BENEFIT FROM. WE ARE IN THE WORLD OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. WE WILL LIKELY NEED DEVICES THAT ARE AI EQUIPPED LONGERTERM. THAT WILL LEAD TO MORE DEMAND. THIS IS LESS THAN ONE TIMES SALES WITH 3.8% DIVDENED. IT IS SOMETHING YOU WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT. >>. MULTIPLE REASONS WHY WE WANT TO LOOK AT THAT. FINALLY, BIRKENSTOCK IS UP 12% SINCE THE OCTOBER IPO. UBS IS FOCUSING ON GRAND STRENGTH AND DIRECT TO CONSUMER SALES AS THE COMPANY MANAGES INVENTORY TO MAINTAIN PRICING POWER. THIS IS A NICE CHART. HOW WOULD YOU TRADE BIRKENSTOCK? >>. UNLIKE MANY IPOs, THIS ONE IS PROFITABLE AND HAS HEALTHY MARGINS. THEY HAVE INCREASEDED DEMAND. SOME MILLENNIALS ARE BUYING MORE BIRKENSTOCKS AFTER THEY WERE IN THE BARBIE MOVIE. I WOULD STAY AWAY FROM IT, BECAUSE IT TRADES VERY EXPENSIVELY FOUR TIMES NEXT YEAR'S EARNINGS.

I KNOW COSTCO HAS BEEN ON A TEAR LATELY BUT THEY'RE ONE OF MY FAVORITE STOCKS IN THE SECTOR AND ON THE HEELS OF THE GREAT KROGER RESULTS THIS MORNING WE FEEL THEY WILL HAVE CONTINUED SUPPLY CHAIN EASING, CONTINUING TO BOOST THEIR FREE CASH FLOW AS WELL AS THE REVENUES AND SALES. WE KNOW THEIR FOOT TRAFFIC AND THEIR SALES ARE UP IN DECEMBER AND JANUARY FROM RELEASE NUMBERS THEY'VE GIVEN US AND WE THINK WE'VE SEEN BIG TICKET ITEMS START TO MOVE, BEYOND JUST THE INCREASE IN SUNDRIES. I THINK THIS STOCK HAS ROOM TO RUN ALWAYS TRADE AT A PREMIUM TO THEIR PEERS. NOT A CHEAP STOCK HERE, BUT THEY'RE BREAKING OUT TO NEW HIGHS. THEY'VE BROKEN OUT OF THE RANGE AND THEY WILL SEE UPSIDE AND GOOD EARNINGS UNDER THE HOOD TODAY. >>. THE COSTCO TRADE IS A BUY FROM VICTORIA. NEXT UP, LET'S TURN TO SEMICONDUCTORS. BROADCOM SHARES, MORE THAN DOUBLING OVER THE PAST YEAR. CITI EXPECTING AI TO DRIVE SALES. NO SURPRISE.

I THINK I LIKE, IF I DIDN'T RECOMMEND A BUYING STOCK IN THIS AI ENVIRONMENT. THEY HAD A CORE CHIP BUSINESS. WE WERE WORRIED ABOUT SLOWNESS IN THE HARDWARE AND THEIR CORE SEMI BUSINESS. AI ACCELERATION SHOULD GROW FROM 15% REVENUES TO 25% REVENUES. WE THINK THAT SOFT DEMAND ON THE HARDWARE SIDE SHOULD CONTINUE TO GROW AND MAYBE THAT'S BOTTOMED OUT. GROWTH ON THE SEMI SIDE FROM THE AI GROWTH ON A BETTER TELECOM AND INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE VM WARE TOOK THEM $69 BILLION AND 18 MONTHS. THEY CAN WORK ON THE SYNERGIES THAT GETS THEM THE HYBRID CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE ESTIMATED MAYBE $12 BILLION ACCRETION TO REVENUE. I SEE UPSIDE TO THIS STOCK AND CHEAP RELATIVE TO ITS PEERS BECAUSE IT'S BEEN A QUALITY STOCK AND ALREADY GROWING PRECASH FLOW GROWING DIVIDENDS AND GROWING BEFORE THE AI MANIA CAME IN.

DOCUSIGN IS A SELL TO ME. THE ONLY REASON YOU HOLD THE STOCK IS: SOMEBODY TAKES IT, PRIVATE, IT FELL APART. I DON'T LIKE HOW MANY TIMES THEY'VE HAD TO RESTRUCTURE AND CUT STAFF. CONCERNING TO ME IS THE REVENUES ARE FALLING FOR HIGH, MULTIPLE STOCK. YOU'RE NOT SEEING THE GROWTH IN REVENUE TO JUSTIFY THE MULTIPLE AND THE STAFF THAT THEY CUT ARE FROM THE SALES AND MARKETING SIDE. IF WE SEE SLOWER DEMAND AND WE SEE IN THE CORE 300,000 REVENUE PLUS SEGMENT OF THEIR BOOK WHICH HAS BEEN SLOWING, THAT'S A HUGE S SEGMENT OF THE BOOK.",[23]

SO THREE IS BEING GENEROUS AND MAY EVEN SHIFT IT TO FOUR OR FIVE, BUT AT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT, IF YOU LOOK AT THE TOP, THREE OPENAI OBVIOUSLY HAS LEADERSHIP. GOOGLE HAS BEEN SLOW TO IB NNOVATE. WE DO OWN GOOGLE AND FRUSTRATED WITH THEIR PACE OF INNOVATION, BUT BELIEVE THEIR DATA IS IN A GREAT PLACE. YOU ASK THE QUESTION ABOUT THE KEY DATA. THAT IS GOING TO FORM THE NEXT FOUNDATION MODELS. WHEN IT COMES TO AMAZON, THEIR DATA IS GOOD AROUND COMMERCE, BUT THEIR PARTNER, ANTHROPIC, HAS, IN OUR OPINION, THE WEAKEST OF THOSE FOUNDATION MODELS. WE USE THESE MODEL, A TEPID MODEL, AND THAT IS SOMETHING. THAT IS GOING TO HAMSTRING WHAT THEY'RE DOING IN AI SEPARATELY. IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT THEY ALSO HAVE, A PARTNERSHIP ANTHROPIC DOES WITH GOOGLE, WHEN IT COMES TO AI, AMAZON JUST SIMPLY DOESN'T HAVE THE PARTNERSHIPS AND THE DATA TO REALLY ELEVATE THEM SEPARATELY. IF YOU LOOK AT AWS, WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY ONE AVENUE WHERE THEY CAN CAPITALIZE ON AI, IS THAT THAT PART OF THEIR BUSINESS IS LESS IMPORTANT. THEY GREW AT 13% IN THE DECEMBER QUARTER, WELL BEHIND AZURE AT 26 AND MICROSOFT AT 30.. THEY'RE LOSING SHARE IN CLOUD FROM. OUR PERSPECTIVE IS THAT.

YOU HAVE VERY SIGNIFICANT SYNERGIES IN TERMS OF OPERATING SYNERGIES AND GROWTH. I THINK THIS IS A CALM THAT YOU GET INTO 2025 AND THEY WILL DO BALLPARK $60 PER EARNINGS.

AFTER ANNOUNCING IT REACHED A DEAL FOR A BILLION- DOLLAR CASH INFUSION FROM SEVERAL INVESTMENT FIRMS. BUT ENOUGH ABOUT THAT, LET'S GO BROAD. LET'S GET TO TODAY'S MARKET ACTION WITH OUR PANEL. JOINING US NOW IS ROBERT DURRANT OF BDA CAPITAL AND DIRK MILLER OF CDE RESEARCH. WELCOME, DIRK. YOU SAY YOU ARE ACTUALLY IN A BUBBLE RIGHT NOW, BUT IT IS STILL INFLATING. IT SOUNDS LIKE PERHAPS. YOU AGREE WITH CHAIR POWELL THAT NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO CUT RATES >>, AND THAT IS THROWN AROUND. EASILY RIGHT IF YOU HAVE A FAIRLY STRICT DEFINITION OF SOMETHING GOING UP MORE THAN TWO SETS OF DEVIATIONS ACROSS A LONG-TERM TREND. IN REAL TERMS, YOU ARE THERE, BUT YOU- AND IN PUBLIC TERRITORY, YOU SELL THE BUBBLE BECAUSE IT KEEPS INFLATING AT THE END OF THE TERRITORY MIDDLE OF LAST YEAR AND TYPICALLY, THESE THINGS CAN LAST LONGER THAN TWO YEARS. SO, YES, I THINK THE BUBBLE IS STILL RELATIVELY EARLY AND THERE IS, OF COURSE A QUICK QUESTION MARKS ON IF THE FED SHOULD CUT INTO THE BUBBLE EVEN THOUGH, WE THINK THEY WILL. >>. BARBARA, AT THE MORE MICRO LEVEL, I THINK THAT YOU LIKE MORE CONSUMER SPENDING ON PULLBACKS BUT GIVING FOOTLOCKER AND BROWN-FORMAN ALL HAD BAD HOLIDAY QUARTERS. CAMPBELL'S SOUP SAID, FISCAL '24 SALES ARE TRAILING NEAR THE END OF THEIR FORECAST AND FICA ANNOUNCED CREDIT SCORES DIPPED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A DECADE. HOW DO YOU INVEST, DESPITE THOSE ROCKS IN THE WATER >>. IN THE CONSUMER DISCRETIONARY FOR ME, THERE WERE VERY SPECIFIC NAMES THAT TO ME ARE ROCK SOLID. WE TALKED ABOUT THE EFORE, COSTCO, WALMART NAMES LIKE THAT, THAT REALLY HAVE SUCH GREAT BUSINESS MODELS THAT THEY CAN REALLY WITHSTAND A LOT OF ECONOMIC TURMOIL AND CERTAINLY BOTH OF THEM HAVE GREAT EXPANSION PLANS. THE WALMART SIDE: THEY ARE DOING THE OMNICHANNEL VERY WELL AND HAVE SO MANY NEW INITIATIVES. THEY ARE GAINING SHARE AND THEY ARE THE BIGGEST COMPANY IN THE WORLD IN TERMS OF SALES. COSTCO HAS LOTS OF ROOM TO GROW. THEY HAVE A NEW CFO AND IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE THE INITIATIVES THEY TAKE, AS THEY HAD A LOT OF ROOM IN TERMS OF e- COMMERCE AND OTHER AREAS THEY HAVEN'T MOVED INTO- NOT TO MENTION- NEW STORES, ABROAD AND HERE. SO THOSE RE THE AREAS I AM LOOKING AT, OR AT MASTERCARD, IF YOU WANT TO CONSIDER THAT A CONSUMER DISCRETIONARY NAME THAT, OR VISA. THEY ARE BASICALLY A DUOPOLY IN TERMS OF DOMINATING IN THAT SPACE AND WE CONTINUE TO SEE A MOVE TO ELECTRONIC TRANSACTIONS AWAY FROM PAPER >>. THERE WITH ALL THE MACRO DATA WE HAVE BEEN GETTING FROM DAY ONE OF TESTIMONY ON THE HILL IS GOOD NEWS, GOOD NEWS FOR THE MARKET NOW, OR IS EVERYONE JUST GETTING AHEAD OF THEMSELVES? >> ABSOLUTELY, AND THAT IS A BIG CHANGE. MOST OF THE SECOND HALF OF LAST YEAR BAD NEWS WAS GOOD NEWS FOR THE S&P, AND THE REASON WAS, OF COURSE, THAT PEOPLE REALLY WANTED THE TREND TO GET GOING, START COVERING SO FORTH. AT THIS STAGE, WE FIND IT IS MUCH MORE GOOD NEWS. THE GOOD NEWS IS GOOD NEWS. I THINK THE REASON IS THAT INVESTOR SPACE- YOU UNDERSTAND THE FEDERAL- WILL BE GOING REGARDLESS. THEY WILL NOT BE DETERRED BY THIS DATA MAY BE BY INFLATION DATA, BUT NOT SOME OF THE LOWER DATA. THEREFORE, GOOD NEWS IS GOOD NEWS AND THE MARKET LIKES IT >>. I WANT TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS BARBARA TOO, AS WE NOW SET OUR SIGHTS ON THE JOB LATER THIS WEEK. WE GOT SOME EARLY INDICATORS. THAT MAY BE. SOME THINGS ARE A LITTLE BIT SOFTER THAN ANTICIPATED. AHEAD OF THAT. >>. RIGHT, I THINK WE CONTINUE TO SEE LOTS OF GOOD NEWS IN TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT, WAGE GROWTH AND SAVINGS. THERE ARE SOME ESTIMATES FOR INSTANCE IN TERMS OF A $38 TRILLION WEALTH EFFECT FROM THE STOCK MARKET ACTION SINCE 2019, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, YOU ARE SEEING LOTS OF POSITIVE THINGS BUT A LOT OF MODERATION. A LITTLE BIT LOWER IN LABOR, A LITTLE BIT LOWER HERE. YOU SAW THE JOLTS NUMBERS TODAY- A LITTLE BIT LOWER IN THE NUMBER OF OPENINGS AND LOWER IN THE NUMBER OF HOURS WORKED. SO YOU ARE STARTING TO SEE SOFTENING ON THE EDGES, LIKE CREDIT CARDS. WE ARE NOW AT RECORD HIGH DEBT, BUT NONE OF IT IS IN THE RED ALARM TERRITORY BUT IT IS THE MODERATING GROWTH THAT ALSO, I THINK, IS HELPFUL FOR THE FED. THAT IS WHAT POWELL REITERATED TODAY. HE SEES A SOFT LANDING VERY MUCH IN HIS SIGHTS AND THEN INFLATION. CERTAINLY RATES HAVE PEAKED. SO UNLESS YOU HAD SOME NASTY SURPRISE -- WHICH DOESN'T SEEM LIKELY AT THIS POINT. >>. BARBARA, WE GET KROGER, COSTCO AND BROADCAM EARNINGS TOMORROW. YOU ALREADY TALKED ABOUT COSTCO, FOR EXAMPLE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH SOME OF THESE AI DRIVEN STOCKS? NOT TALKING ABOUT NVIDIA, TALKING ABOUT BROADCOM AND SOME OF THE SEMIS. CAN YOU, BY SEMIS AND AI, DRIVEN SOFTWARE AT THESE HEIGHTS? >>. I OWN SOME- NOT AS MUCH AS NVIDIA- AND IT IS ALWAYS A QUESTION WHEN A STOCK HAS A BIG RUN UP BUT IT COMES DOWN TO THIS BIGGER QUESTION OF AI AND CERTAINLY, I THINK YOU HEARD THE NEWS FROM NVIDIA: TWO DIFFERENT CONFERENCES THIS WEEK. THAT THE POTENTIAL USE AND THE BROADENING OF THE CUSTOMER BASE IS HUGE, AND THAT GOES THE SAME FOR BROADCOM. SO I THINK IT IS ALWAYS A LITTLE UNNERVING WHEN A STOCK HAS HAD MONTHS TO COME UP, BUT THE EARNINGS AND THE SALES ARE REAL AND SUSTAINABLE FOR A WHILE. SO I THINK, WHEN YOU HAVE ANY PULLBACK, LIKE YESTERDAY- WE HAVEN'T EVEN HAD A 3% PULLBACK, AS MY PRESENT HOLY LIKES TO PUT IT NOW, IN THE LAST FOUR MONTH.",[75]

DELL WILL BE UP THE MOST OF ANY STOCK TODAY AND I THINK HPE IS A POSSIBILITY TO BE DOWN THE MOST. THERE WAS A MOMENT IN THE CONFERENCE CALL WHERE IT WAS JUST A JAW-DROPPING MOMENT.

""HOWEVER GPU AVAILABILITY REMAINS TIGHT"". MICHAEL DELL HAS THE GPUs. ""AND OUR DELIVERY TIME HAS BEEN DELAYED"". BROADCOM AND DELL NO >>. SO YOU NEED TO DRAW THE CONTRAST EVEN MORE. SO THEN DELL IS -- WAS ABLE TO GET ACCESS TO H 100s, FOR EXAMPLE, INCORPORATE THEM IN THE SERVERS, THAT THEIR CUSTOMERS WANT TO DRIVE THEIR GENERATIVE AI PLATFORMS. THESE GUYS WORK, SO WHAT ACCOUNTS FOR THAT? WHAT ACCOUNTS FOR NOT BEING ON TOP OF THAT? >>. I THINK THAT MICHAEL DELL -- JENSEN HUANG- WANTS TO GIVE IT TO EVERYBODY, BUT SOME CUSTOMERS ARE MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS, AND MICHAEL DELL HAS A GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH JENSEN >>. SO IT REALLY IS ABOUT HAVING A PREFERRED RELATIONSHIP WITH NVIDIA. THAT IS GOING TO --. THAT IS GOING TO MEAN: YOU'RE UP 31% VERSUS DOWN 5% >>. I DON'T KNOW WHY HPE DIDN'T GET THE CHIPS, THE GRAPHICS CARDS. I DO KNOW THAT TO SAY THAT NETWORK AND DEMAND INDUSTRYWIDE SOFTENED IS JUST -- >>. IT'S NOT TRUE. >>.

THESE MOVES ARE ALL SIGNS EMBLEMATIC OF A BUBBLE, BUT COMPANY IS DOING MUCH BETTER THAN EXPECTED. STOCKS ARE DOING UP ON RATIONAL EXPERIENCE, NOT ON IRRATIONAL.

FOLLOWING THIS MORNING'S FOURTH QUARTER PROFIT AND REVENUE BEATS. THAT STOCK THIS MORNING UP BY 8.3%. AFTER THOSE RESULTS- AND MICHAEL LASSER IS UBS RETAIL ANALYST- HE JOINS US RIGHT NOW TO TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT IT. THE COMPANY PRETTY CONVINCINGLY BEAT FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER. ITS GUIDANCE FOR THE FULL YEAR WAS ABOUT IN LINE WITH WHAT THE STREET'S EXPECTING BUT THE GUIDANCE FOR THE CURRENT QUARTER IS BELOW: STILL, YOU'RE LOOKING AT THAT STOCK UP MORE THAN 8%. WHY IS THAT? WHAT DID YOU SEE THAT YOU LIKED? >>. I THINK THERE ARE THREE REASONS WHY THE STOCK'S UP. NUMBER ONE: IT'S GETTING ITS TRAFFIC BACK. IT WAS ONLY DOWN 2% THIS QUARTER AFTER BEING DOWN MID-SINGLE DIGITS FOR THE LAST FEW QUARTERS. NUMBER TWO: THE PROFITABILITY OF THIS BUSINESS IS RETURNING BACK TO WHERE IT WAS HISTORICALLY. AND NUMBER THREE: I THINK THE MARKET'S LOOKING AT THE OUTLOOK AND SAYING IT'S SET A CONSERVATIVE EXPECTATION THAT WILL AFFORD THEM TO HAVE AN UPWARD EARNINGS REVISION CYCLE THAT WILL CONTINUE TO DRIVE THE STOCK. >> WHY WAS THE TRAFFIC DOWN, DO YOU THINK? >>. I THINK THE TRAFFIC WAS DOWN FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS. ONE TARGET: OVERINDEXES TO CATEGORIES THAT WEREUNDER PRESSURE THINGS, LIKE CONSUMER ELECTRONICS, WHICH WAS ABOUT 10% OF THE SALES IN THE FOURTH QUARTER TOYS WERE UNDER PRESSURE. A HOME: THAT'S A THIRD OF THE -- THAT'S A THIRD OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL SALES IN THE FIRST QUARTER. >> THOSE THREE ITEMS. >> THOSE THREE ITEMS. SO DESPITE THAT IT STILL WAS ONLY DOWN 2%. THAT'S AN ENCOURAGING SIGN. SO IF YOU WEIGHTED SALES BY CATEGORY, ALL THINGS CONSIDERED, IT'S DOING NOT TOO BAD. >>. BRIAN TALKED A LITTLE BIT HERE ABOUT WHAT THEY'VE BEEN DOING TO TRY TO RAISE THEIR OPERATING MARGINS, RAISE THEIR PROFIT MARGINS, AND A LOT OF. THAT HAS TO DO WITH CUTTING THE NUMBER OF SKUs, WITH MAKING SURE THAT THEY REALLY HAVE INVENTORY UNDER CONTROL, AND THEY SAY ARE PUTTING THE RIGHT THINGS OUT THERE. THAT'S A TOUGH GAME TO CONTINUE TO PLAY. >> YEAH, >> YOU HAVE FAITH THAT. THEY'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK WITH THIS. >> I DO. I THINK THEY WILL BE A LITTLE BIT MORE AGGRESSIVE IN THE CATEGORIES WHERE THERE'S STRENGTH AREAS, LIKE BEAUTY, CERTAIN, CONSUMABLE ITEMS. THEY JUST LAUNCHED A NEW, MORE VALUE-ORIENTED LINE OF FOOD PRODUCTS. SO I THINKTHAL MAKE SOME VERY STRATEGIC BETS ON INVENTORY, WHICH IS KEY, BECAUSE THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN A POSITIVE SALES MOMENTUM AS WELL AS IMPROVING MARGINS FROM HERE. >> YOU GOT YOUR BUY RATING AT $174.. THAT STOCK IS UP MORE THAN $12. >>. SO WHAT DO YOU DO WITH YOUR PRICE TARGET? >> WE'RE CONSTANTLY ARRIVING OUR PRICE TARGET BUT ONE WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT IS THAT THIS PRINT PUT TARGET IN POSITION. TO RESUME A 6% OPERATING MARGIN: IT GUIDED 860 TO 960 FOR THIS YEAR. IF IT HITS A 6% OPERATING MARGIN, ITS EARNINGS WILL BE CLOSE TO 10.50, CLOSE TO $11..

THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. WE ALWAYS TURN TO YOU FOR ALL THINGS APPLE. TAKE US THROUGH. WHAT EXACTLY THIS ALL MEANS FOR APPLE AND WHETHER OR NOT, THIS IS A BULL CASE FOR EVALUATION. >>. WHAT IT MEANS FOR APPLE IN YOUR TERM IS: INVESTORS ARE VOTING THAT THEY DON'T HAVE CONFIDENCE IN APPLES AI STRATEGY. THAT IS UNDERSTANDABLE, OF COURSE, BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN OVER THE PAST COUPLE MONTHS THAT WE HAVE HEARD MORE ABOUT THAT ULTIMATELY. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THEIR AI STRATEGY, IT COMES DOWN TO HOW ARE THEY GOING TO MAKE MONEY ON THIS? INVESTORS NOW ARE GENERALLY ON THE SAME PAGE THAT THIS JUNE AT WWDC, WE WILL SEE THEM WITH THE FIRST FOUNDATION MODEL. THIS WOULD COMPETE WITH CHAT GPT, GEMINI, EXAI. THIS IS THE TOP FOUR OR FIVE LLAMA FOR META- REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THEY HAVE THAT. SO THAT IS ONE PIECE COMING OUT WITH THAT MODEL STILL DOESN'T ANSWER THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION THAT INVESTORS ARE ASKING: WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THE BUSINESS? I'M GOING TO FILL IN SOME OF THOSE BLANKS WHAT IT MEANS FOR THEIR BUSINESS. OF COURSE, THEY WILL USE AI TO MAKE BETTER PREDICTIVE TEXT AND ADD THE FIT AND FINISH AROUND THEIR HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE LIKE SOME OF THE MAX THEY HAVE ANNOUNCED. MORE IMPORTANTLY, THEY COME OUT WITH A SUBSCRIPTION FOR PERSONALIZED AI. I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE BIG UNLOCKS FOR CONSUMER VALUE IN AI. ESSENTIALLY, IT IS A UNIQUE PLACE THAT APPLE HAS BECAUSE OF THEIR ROLE WITH PRIVACY AND SECURITY IN THE TRUST WITH CONSUMERS. PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO LET PPLE USE THEIR DATA OFTEN TO ALLOW THESE AI BOTS TO DO TASKS FOR THEM TO CONTACT YOUR UTILITY COMPANY, BOOK A TRIP, COMPOSE EMAILS. THERE IS A LOT THAT CAN BE DONE. WHEN I THINK ABOUT THAT OPPORTUNITY, IT COMES DOWN TO A SUBSCRIPTION BUSINESS. IF YOU LOOK AT THEIR ACTIVE BASE AND DEVICES SOMETHING THAT ARE CLEAR: ABOUT 2.2 BILLION, GROWING ABOUT 8% A YEAR. THEY DON'T GIVE OUT THE ACTIVE USER NUMBER. I ESTIMATE THAT ABOUT 1.4 BILLION. BUT OF 20% OF THAT 1.4 BILLION, WHAT OPT IN FOR A $10 A MONTH PERSONALIZED AI SERVICE. THIS IS GOING TO TAKE A FEW YEARS TO GET THERE. THAT WOULD AT OVER 15% TO APPLE'S EARNINGS. WHEN YOU PUT ALL OF THIS TOGETHER, UNDERSTANDABLE INVESTORS REACTION BUT I THINK INVESTORS ARE FORGETTING THAT THERE ARE ONE POINT ALMOST 5 BILLION PEOPLE THAT LIVE THEIR LIVES THROUGHOUT THE DAY ON APPLE DEVICES THAT STICKINESS IS A HUGE LONG-TERM OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO SELL AI PRODUCTS INTO >>. I DO HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THIS. YOU FIND $2 BILLION AS OF NOW BUT THAT THERE IS A HIGH LIKELIHOOD APPLE WILL APPEAL WORST-CASE SCENARIO. IT DOESN'T WORK. THEY HAVE TO PAY THE $2 BILLION FINE. WAS IT WORTH IT? APPLE HAS A PRETTY BIG CASH PILE WITH FOR THE, FOR THE BUSINESS IT DID GET EVEN IF IT BELIEVES A GOT, A FAIR AND SQUARE, COME UP WITH THE REVENUE IT HAS ACQUIRED IN THE EU >>. I AGREE IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE LIKE 1 BILLION. AFTER EVERYTHING SAID AND DONE IT WILL TAKE ONE YEAR IS 3% OF THEIR CASH AT THAT 2 BILLION LEVEL. THE BIGGER QUESTION FOR ME IS WHAT IMPACT ARE THESE TYPES OF FINES GOING TO HAVE ON APPLE'S REVENUE GLOBALLY? IN THE LAST EARNINGS CALL THEY TALKED ABOUT THE APP STORE IN EUROPE WAS 7% OF TOTAL APP STORE REVENUE. THAT EQUATES TO HAVE A PERCENT OF APPLE'S OVERALL REVENUE. THEY KNEW THIS WAS COMING, THIS FINE WAS COMING, AND THEY WANTED TO GET IN FRONT OF INVESTORS AND REMIND THEM HOW SMALL OF A PIECE THAT THIS IS. IT DOES NOT CHANGE. THE BIGGER QUESTION: THERE WILL BE CHANGES COMING TO APPLE'S APP STORE ACROSS THE BOARD. THIS IS PROBABLY 40% OF APPLE'S EARNINGS COME FROM SERVICES MORE BROADLY, AND SO I THINK, WHEN I THINK OF THAT DYNAMIC, THEY WILL PAY THE FINE AND IT REALLY STICKS OUT. I HAVE BEEN CLOSELY WATCHING WHAT HAS HAPPENED: CANADA, US, SOUTH KOREA, JAPAN, THE EU. IN TERMS OF ALL THESE CHANGES, APPLE IS REALLY SMART. THEY WILL GO AND MAKE CHANGES TO ACCOMMODATE THE COURTS BUT THEN THEY FIND WAYS TO ESSENTIALLY CHARGE THE DEVELOPERS ANYWAY. I SUSPECT THAT WILL FRUSTRATE AND IN FOR A GREAT SOME DEVELOPERS.

THAT WAS BECAUSE TESLA WAS HAVING SUCH GREAT SUCCESS AND IT WAS EASY TO EXTRAPOLATE THAT. AS WE SIT HERE TODAY IN THE EV TROUGH OF DISALLUSIONMENT, THEY SEE, THE CAR MARKET IS STILL FRAGMENTED. MOST OF THE VALUE IS NOT YET IN THE COMPUTE. THEY CAN'T GET TO 50% MARGINS THERE, SO THEY'RE STEPPING BACK AND INVESTING IN AI, WHICH HAS FAR MORE POTENTIAL FOR THEM, ESPECIALLY IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS. >>. DO WE HAVE ANY SENSE, DAN, OF HOW MUCH CAPITAL THEY PUT FORWARD FOR THIS ENDEAVOR OVER THE YEARS? >> IT'S BILLIONS. IT COULD POTENTIALLY BE UP TO 8 TO 10 BILLION IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY ACTUALLY SPENT FOR APPLE. THEY'VE BEEN THERE BEFORE WHERE THEY SPEND FOR PRODUCTS.

IS THAT WHAT YOU THOUGHT THE COMPANY WAS PLANNING? >>. THAT IS ABOUT RIGHT. GOING BACK TO THE CONVERSATION WE HAD LAST WEEK WITH HOME DEPOT, WHAT THIS IS IS ANOTHER SOFTISH REPORT FROM THE LEADING HOME IMPROVEMENT RETAILER. THIS CASE IS LOWE'S AND LAST WEEK WAS HOME DEPOT. THIS IS INDICATIVE OF THE BACK DROP FOR HOME IMPROVEMENT WHICH IS CHALLENGING- I'LL SAY THIS FOR LOWE'S AS WELL AS HOME DEPOT. THESE COMPANIES ARE MANAGING THIS DROP WELL. I'M WATCHING THE SCREEN AS LOWE'S IS POPPING 3% PRE-MARKET. WHAT INVESTORS ARE SAYING IS THEY ARE INCREASINGLY LOOKING THROUGH THE FUNDAMENTAL WEAKNESS TOWARD THE BACK HALF OF FISCAL 2024 AND WHEN HOME IMPROVEMENT SHOULD STRENGTHEN AS RATES MODERATE. LOWE'S AND HOME DEPOT ARE WELL RUN BUSINESSES AND MANAGED WELL AND GENERATING TONS OF CASH. FOR THE NOW LAST FIVE OR SIX QUARTERS THEY HAVE BEEN IN THE POST-COVID SOFT SPOT OR RESET. GIVEN THE GUIDANCE, IT WILL PERSIST INTO 2024.. THE MARKET IS INCREASINGLY LOOKING AT RESTRENGTHENING RESULTS AS RATES LIKELY HO E MODERATE. >>. THIS IS REMINDING ME OF THE LAST SIX MONTHS HOME DEPOT AND LOWE'S BOTH SOLD OFF A LOT. IT WAS UNCHARACTERISTIC OF HOME DEPOT. THE RESULTS, THE FUNDAMENTALS, DID NOT IMPROVE MUCH WITH HOME DEPOT, BUT THE STOCK HAS BEEN ON A TEAR. IF WE LOOK AT THE LONGER-TERM CHARTS, THEY ARE BOTH NEAR HIGHS, BOTH NEAR 52-WEEK HIGHS. THEY GAINED BACK ALL OF THE WEAKNESS WE SAW. IT IS SO HARD TO SEE ON SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU CAN SEE IT OVER ON THE VERY RIGHT-HAND SIDE OF THAT IN LATE 2023 WHEN IT SOLD OFF. NOW, AS YOU SAY, THESE ARE ABOUT WHERE THE RESULTS WERE EXPECTED TO BE. PEOPLE SEEM TO BE LOOKING THROUGH IT. TO WHATEVER POSITIVES ARE GOING TO HAPPEN NEAR TERM OR IMMEDIATE TERM, LET'S SAY: >> THAT'S RIGHT. I WANT TO BE CLEAR. I LOVE TALKING ON YOUR SHOW ABOUT THESE TWO NAMES. MAKE SURE IT IS CLEAR TO THE AUDIENCE HERE. THESE ARE GREAT COMPANIES OVER ANY LENGTH OF TIME. HOME DEPOT AND LOWE'S ARE WELL POSITIONED. IT WASN'T THAT LONG AGO THAT MY TEAM AND I DOWNGRADED LOWE'S AND HOME DEPOT ON THE IDEA OF THE NEAR-TERM EUPHORIA. WE THINK THIS MAY BE A BIT OPT OPTIMIST, AS I THINK HOW 2024 PLAYS OUT HERE. THE FUNDAMENTAL SOFTNESS WE HAVE SEEN COULD PERSIST LONGER. I'M NOT AN ECONOMIST OR RATE EXPERT. IT WOULD NOT SURPRISE ME IF RATES STAY HIGHER FOR LONGER. THAT IS THE HOUSE VIEW AND THAT IS THE NARRATIVE FOR THE BROADER MARKET, AND PARTICULARLY THESE NAMES. THAT IS WHEN YOU SEE THE STOCKS GET UNDER PRESSURE. RIGHT NOW THE VALUATIONS FOR LOWE'S AND HOME DEPOT ARE AT THE TOP END. THERE IS A DECENT AMOUNT OF OPTIMISM HERE.",[57]

THIS IS AN IPHONE VERSUS ANDROID, SUPER MICRO VERSUS THE TRADITIONAL PLAYER SITUATION >>. IF THEY GET LIQUID COOLING, RIGHT, IT MIGHT BE. THE PROBLEM IS: RIGHT NOW, LIQUID COOLING, IS IT REALLY UTILIZED? I DON'T THINK IT'S SO MUCH OF 2024 TYPE TECHNOLOGY AS A 2025 OR 2026 TECHNOLOGY. BUT THAT'S THE QUESTION. CAN THEY FIGURE OUT SOME KIND OF DIFFERENTIATOR SO THEY LOOK LIKE APPLE IOS OR THEY LOOK LIKE MICROSOFT WINDOWS FOR'S SERVERS? THEY LOOK HISTORICALLY LIKE PACE -- PCS GET LIKE ADELE. AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU ARE BUYING A PC. >>. THAT'S WHEN I GO TO THE MARKET CAP QUESTION. IF YOU JUST LOOK AT THE MARKET CAP QUESTION -- NOW IS IN THE 80 BILLION RANGE. BUT WOULD IT TAKE FOR A COMPANY LIKE THIS WOULD BE -- WHAT KIND OF MARGINS WITH THE NEED TO HAVE MORE SALES WITH THEY HAVE TO HAVE IN ORDER FOR THAT TO BE REASONABLE >>. I THINK TWO THINGS HAVE TO HAPPEN: THE MERGE HAVE TO BE SUSTAINABLE, OVERTIME, CURRENTLY. THEY'VE BEEN WHERE THEY ARE HISTORICALLY BUT THERE'S A QUESTION THAT, WITH THE MUCH HIGHER PRICES THAT ARE BEING PAID FOR THESE SERVERS, A LOT OF WHICH IS BEING ATTRIBUTABLE TO NVIDIA, AT THIS POINT, CAN YOU MAINTAIN THESE MARGINS? THEY'VE BEEN GETTING ON STANDARD SERVERS AND IT COMES DOWN TO HOW BIG IS THE MARKET? OBVIOUSLY, THERE ARE NUMBERS ALL OVER THE PLACE OUT THERE -- WITH THE 60% OR 70% NUMBER, CAN THEY DIFFERENTIATE THEMSELVES AGAIN WITH THE GROWTH NUMBER? THERE IS NO PROBLEM IN Q1, THERE CERTAINLY ISN'T A PROBLEM IN Q2.. IT'S MORE GETTING BACK TO A NP SUGGESTING THAT THERE IS A 40 BILLION DOLLAR -- DO WE START TO GET TO THOSE NUMBERS? >>. IS THERE ALSO A STORAGE AND NETWORKING OPPORTUNITY FOR SUPERMICRO BEYOND COMPUTING? DO YOU HAVE A SENSE OF THAT? >> THAT'S HARDER FOR ME TO SAY SO HISTORICALLY. STORAGE, THERE'S LOTS OF INVESTMENT AND SOFTWARE IN STORAGE WITH NETWORKING AGAIN, THERE IS AN INVESTMENT PARTICULARLY AROUND THE SOFTWARE FOR THE NETWORKING SIDE OF THINGS. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT COMPANIES LIKE CISCO, NETAPP OR PURE STORAGE. THEY SPEND A LOT OF THE REVENUE ON R&D AND THEY'RE NOT JUST STRONGER THAT WAY. CERTAINLY THEIR SPE.",[146]

GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. >>. THANK YOU, SCOTT. >> THINGS THAT JUMPED OUT TO ME CERTAINLY FROM YOUR NOTES: S&P AT 5800 BY YEAR AND DID YOU RECENTLY UP YOUR OUTLOOK BASED ON WHAT YOU ARE SEEING? >>. NO, WE HIT THAT WITH ESCAPE VELOCITY WHICH WE GOT IN NOVEMBER THIS COMBINATION OF 20-DAY HIGHS THAT WE LOOK AT. IT WAS A BIG NUMBER. IT WAS IN THE 70% READINGS. THAT WAS REALLY A HANDFUL HISTORICALLY IN WHAT WE KNOW FROM THAT DATA, THE MARKET IS GENERALLY UP A LITTLE OVER 20% FROM THAT POINT, WHICH IS NOT A COMFORTABLE THING TO SAY, BUT THAT WAS 5800.. THE DATA IS GOOD DATA. WE BELIEVE IN THIS MOMENTUM INDICATOR. WE DID THAT BACK IN NOVEMBER OF LAST YEAR. >> WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CHARTS YOU'RE GOING TO SHOW US ONE THAT KIND OF CONFIRMS THIS HIGH MOMENT TO MARKET THAT YOU SUGGEST WE ARE IN CORRECT. >>. YES, LOOK, THERE IS SOMETHING -- AND I'M IN ABOUT -- AN APOLOGETIC TREND FOLLOWER AND MOMENTUM PLAYER BUT THERE ARE POINTS WHERE MOMENTUM COMES FURTHER. NO DOUBT ABOUT IT BEING IN A MOMENT TO MARKET IS BEING IN A DANGEROUS MOMENT TO MARKET ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE LOOK AT. WHAT PERCENTILE ARE WE IN TERMS OF RETURNS FOR LOW MOMENTUM AND HIGH MOMENTUM NAMES THAT SPREAD GETS INTO THE HIGH PERCENTILE MOMENTUM IS WORKING AT THE EXPENSE OF EVERYTHING ELSE MICHAEL SANTOLI. IT REALLY DOES BEGIN A REFLECTION OF THE NARRATIVE. THAT IS WHERE WE TEND TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND SAY, OKAY, THERE IS DANGER. HERE WE ARE IN THE 87TH PERCENTILE. I KNOW THAT THAT FEELS LIKE IT'S CLOSE ENOUGH TO MAKE THAT PITFALL. THE DATA SAYS THAT IT'S NOT CLOSE ENOUGH TO MAKE THAT CALL FOR US. WE ARE ON GUARD, BUT I STILL THINK THAT WE HAVE SEVERAL WEEKS AHEAD OF US WHERE WE CAN STRETCH THIS. GET US INTO THAT 90TH PERCENTILE. WHEN IT HAPPENS, WE WILL TALK ABOUT IT, BUT THAT'S THE POINT.

THE CHIPS STOCKS THAT ARE GOING CRAZY IS NOT JUST NVIDIA, AMD, SUPER MICRO. I COULD GO DOWN THE LIST FOR TEN MORE NAMES. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GETTING AT. >> ABSOLUTELY LOOK. THIS COMES BACK TO THE MOMENTUM IDEA. THERE ARE TWO FACTORS WE LOOK AT WHEN IT COMES TO BEING CONCERNED ABOUT THE INDUSTRY GROUPS. ONE OF THEM IS BECAUSE IN ISOLATION IT DOESN'T MATTER, IT DOESN'T WORK. WHEN THE COMBINATION HITS, IT IS VERY POWERFUL. THAT IS WHEN WE HAVE HAD A GOOD RUN WORKING, THOSE MOMENTUM NAMES. IT IS REFLECTIVE OF SOME OF THOSE HIGH PERFORMANCE NAMES. TODAY PEOPLES, EXPECTATIONS ARE EVEN HIGHER THAN THE HISTORICAL MOMENTUM WE HAVE SEEN. WE PRICED THAT THROUGH THE OPTION MARKET WHEN WE HAVE THAT COMBINATION OF A GOOD HISTORICAL MOMENTUM IN THESE SPECIFIC NAMES AND THEN THE OPTION PRICING IS SAYING THAT WE ARE BETTING ON EVEN HIGHER PRICES FROM HERE. THAT IS THE POINT OF IT, WHERE WE SAY PRICE PERFECTION, YOU CAN HAVE IT. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE OUR BALL, OR AT LEAST HAVE OUR BALL HOME AND PLAY SOMEWHERE ELSE. WE ARE SEEING THAT IN SEMICONDUCTORS AND STARTING ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO. OBVIOUSLY THAT COULD BE A LITTLE BIT EARLY BUT STATISTICALLY IT IS A MEANINGFUL SIGNAL. WE ARE SEEING THAT ONLY SEMICONDUCTORS HERE. THAT'S ONE AREA WE COULD BE MORE CAUTIOUS ABOUT. >>. YOU'VE BEEN WRITING SOME ABOUT BIOTECH'S. DO I NEED TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT I AM WITNESSING THERE? >>. JUST THE OPPOSITE OF WHERE WE ARE DESCRIBING WHAT HAS HAPPENED. THERE WE HAVE THE MOMENTUM AND AGAIN MOMENTUM AND ISOLATION IS SOMETHING WE PURSUE. WE HAVE A LOT OF THAT WEAKNESS IN THAT SPACE. PEOPLE DON'T BELIEVE IT. THEY ARE BETTING AGAINST IT. WHEN WE SEE THIS -- WHAT WE CALL THE INCREDULOUS ADVANCE- WHERE WE HAVE MOMENTUM OF PEOPLE, THE SENTIMENT JUST DOESN'T REALLY BUY INTO IT. THAT TENDS TO BE VERY POWERFUL. THAT IS TO THE UPSIDE. THE TRENDS TEND TO PERSIST AND KIND OF DRAG PEOPLE KICKING AND SCREAMING INTO THE MARKET. MUCH LIKE WHEN WE SAY THAT THEY WERE DOING WITH THAT SEMICONDUCTORS ONE YEAR AGO. IT IS JUST KIND OF COMING TO EVOLVE WITH BIOTECH. I DON'T THINK THAT. IT'S TOO EARLY. THE OTHER PART THAT I WOULD JUST NOTE TRYING TO SEE THIS OUR EXCESS RETURN MODEL THAT WE RUN FOR EVERY INDIVIDUAL SUB INDUSTRY GROUP. IT'S ACTUALLY SOME OF THE LOWEST EXCESS NEGATIVE RETURNS THAT WE HAVE SEEN IN BIOTECH OVER A ROUGHLY 40 YEAR CAREER. THAT IS A GOOD STARTING SPACE. IN OTHER WORDS, A LOT OF THE EXCESS HAS BEEN RIDGED OUT. PEOPLE HAVE FORGOTTEN ABOUT THAT MOVING ON AS THESE ARE BREAKING OUT. IN STARTING TO SHOW MOMENTUM, THE SENTIMENT HAS ACTUALLY BEEN FIGHTING THAT TREND. THAT IS A GOOD SIGN OF THAT. >>. I HAVE TO BOUNCE, SO I WILL ASK YOU TO BE BRIEF IN YOUR ANSWER.

JOINING US NOW IS TONI SACCONAGHI BERNSTEIN, SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST. A LOT IS SWIRLING AROUND TONI, AND I CAN'T RANK WHICH CONCERNS HAVE HIT THE STOCK OR I SORT OF HIT THE ROAD WHICH WE'VE SEEN REALLY FOR DECADES, ALMOST BUT I'M WORRIED THAT THERE WAS A BIT OF A SEA CHANGE IS THERE OR ONCE AGAIN, DEMISE IS BEING GREATLY EXAGGERATED >>. GOOD MORNING, JOE. THERE ARE A LOT OF FACTORS SWIRLING AROUND APPLE TODAY, BUT I THINK THE CORE OF THE BUSINESS. THIS IS A COMPANY THAT HAS ABOUT 1.2 BILLION UNIQUE USERS AND THEY HAVE A CAPABILITY TO DEVELOP FLNEW PRODUCTS THAT CONSUMERS WANT TO GO AND TRY. THE VISION PRO IS EXPENSIVE AND IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A MASS MARKET PRODUCT FOR SEVERAL YEARS BUT APPLE HAS THE BRAND AND CACHE THAT CONSUMERS WILL EMBRACE NEW PRODUCTS AND, EQUALLY IMPORTANT, EMBRACE NEW SERVICES. AND THAT PLATFORM ISN'T GOING ANYWHERE AND APPLE HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEVERAGE THAT GOING FORWARD. AND SO I THINK IF I HAD TO DIMENSION THE NEXT FIVE YEARS- THE LAST TEN YEARS THEY'VE GROWN ABOUT 6%. THE NEXT YEAR WILL BE MORE MUTED. THAT'S STILL PRETTY GOOD, PARTICULARLY FOR A COMPANY APPLE' APPLE'S-SIZED >>. IN THE PAST, LEGACY HAVE STARTED TO MISS OUT AND THE WORRY IS THAT COULD HAPPEN WITH A AI. IT SEEMS LIKE IT COULD BE IN A MORE ADVANTAGEOUS POSITION THAN SOME OF THE OTHER COMPANIES WE THINK ABOUT IN THE PAST >>. SO, JOE, YOU RAISE A GREAT POINT. IF YOU LOOK AT THE LEADERS IN TECHNOLOGY EVERY 20, 30 YEARS, THEY CHANGE AND THE RISK OF PLATFORM DISRUPTION IS REAL, AND I THINK THAT'S WHY YOU SEE APPLE TAKING STEPS TO TRY AND BE A LEADER IN WEARABLES, WITH THE WATCH AND WITH THE VISION PRO GOING FORWARD. I THINK AI IS CERTAINLY REALLY IMPORTANT TRANSITION POINT IN TECHNOLOGY. I THINK IT WILL BE ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FORCES, BOTH SOCIETAL AND TECHNOLOGICALLY, FOR THE NEXT 20 OR 30 YEARS. BUT I DO AGREE WITH YOUR ASSERTION THAT APPLE HAS THIS POWERFUL INSTALL BASE AND THE QUESTION IS: CAN IT USE AI TO ADD MORE VALUE TO THAT INSTALLED BASE? AND I THINK IT CAN. WE'RE SEEING AI PHONES LAUNCHED IN THE MARKETPLACE: GOOGLE HAS SOME, SAMSUNG HAS SOME. WE THINK THAT APPLE WILL HAVE AI-EENABLED CAPABILITIES IN ITS NEXT PHONE COMING OUT IN SEPTEMBER. SO I DON'T THINK THIS IS -- AND OBVIOUSLY THE iPHONE WILL ALLOW ACCESS TO CHATGPT CO-PILOT OTHER THIRD PARTY AI CAPABILITIES. SO I DON'T, AT THIS POINT, THINK THAT APPLE NECESSARILY HAS TO BE. YOU KNOW THE LEADER IN GENERATIVE AI. I THINKTHAL HAVE A LOT OF AI ON THEIR DEVICE. THAT WILL MAKE THE DEVICE EASIER TO USE AND THERE WILL BE AN ACCESS POINT TO OTHER GENERATIVE AI APPLICATIONS >>. I THINK WE -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE MARKET CAP WAS IN APPLE WHEN WE SAID WHAT'S NEXT? WHAT ABOUT A CAR ENTERTAINMENT, ALL OF THOSE THINGS. SOMEHOW, IT HAS GONE ALMOST 3 TRILLION- NOT QUITE BUT IT WAS CLOSE JUST ON BUILDING OUT SERVICES IN THE ECOSYSTEM AND I GUESS THERE'S NO REASON TO THINK THAT CAN'T CONTINUE IF YOU DO THAT EFFECTIVELY. >>. I THINK WHAT APPLE HAS SHOWN WITH SERVICES IS SO THIS IS A BUSINESS. THAT'S A LITTLE OVER 20% OF REVENUES. IT'S BEEN GROWING DOUBLE DIGIT. SO SERVICES ALONE IS ADDING ALMOST THREE POINTS OF GROWTH TO APPLE EVERY YEAR, AND IT'S A FUNCTION OF A FEW THINGS. APPLE IS INTRODUCING NEW SERVICES EVERY YEAR. WHETHER THEY'RE MEDIA SERVICES OR FINANCIAL SERVICES, THEY'RE DEEPENING PENETRATION. IT FEELS LIKE I NEED MORE STORAGE FOR iCLOUD. SEEMINGLY EVERY FEW MONTHS THEY'RE TAKING PRICE ON SOME OF THOSE SERVICES AND THEY'RE DEEPENING PENETRATION. THERE ARE MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD WHERE PEOPLE STILL DON'T HAVE SERVICES. THAT TRIFECTA OF BEING ABLE TO SELL SERVICES IN NEW PARTS OF THE WORLD, RAISE PRICE, SKAND, INTRODUCE NEW SERVICES LIKELY MEANS THAT BUSINESS CAN GROW DOUBLE DIGITS FOR SEVERAL MORE YEARS >>. ALL RIGHT, THE DEMISE GREATLY EXAGGERATED. BUT YOU DID SATE THAT'S RATCHETING DOWN GROWTH IN REVENUE AND EARNINGS. I GUESS TONI. BUT THAT'S STILL PRETTY GOOD NONETHELESS AND THAT WOULD STILL COMPOUND ON THE STOCK PRICE. IF THE MULTIPLE STAYS THE SAME, AND IT'S NOT THAT EXPENSIVE EITHER, MAYBE IT IS -- TOO EARLY TO SAY- UNTIL IT'S OVER. LAST POINT ON EVALUATION. IF WE LOOK UP APPLE'S EVALUATION, OBVIOUSLY IT'S COME IN. THE MOST IMPORTANT METRIC IS WHAT IS APPLE TRADING AT RELATIVE TO THE MARKET.

I'M STILL PROBABLY BETTING ON LILLY IN TERMS OF THEIR PLOIPELINE AND DEVELOPMENT OTHER MODALITIES INCLUDING LESS FREQUENT DOSING. I DON'T THINK IT'S THAT BIG OF A DEAL. IT'S EASIER TO MONITOR YOURSELF AS A PATIENT ON THE ONCE WEEKLY. I'M NOT SURE IF THE ONCE MONTHLY OR QUARTERLY OR, AS YOU ALLUDED TO, ONCE A YEAR, IS GOING TO TAKE OFF AND BE A GAME CHANGER. I THINK THEY'RE PROBABLY IN THE LEAD FROM A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT MODALITIES FOR THE DRUG, INCLUDING AN ORAL MUSCLE SPARING, AND THERE ARE A BUNCH BIG TECH, BIOTECH COMPANIES WORKING ON THAT. THEY'RE SUPER FOCUSED. EVERY HEADLINE OUT OF THIS SECTOR IS ANOTHER COMPANY, WHETHER IN THE PUBLIC OR PRIVATE ARENA, TRYING TO LIKE. YOU KNOW, TELL THE STREET THAT THEY'RE --. THEY HAVE SOMETHING IN DEVELOPMENT OR THEY'RE MOVING SOMETHING INTO THE CLINIC. IT'S SOMETHING WE'RE GOING TO KEEP AN EYE ON FOR A WHILE. >>. WHAT IS THE TOTAL ADDRESSABLE MARKET? HOW DO YOU MAKE THOSE CALCULATIONS AND GIVE VALUATION ON A STOCK WHICH YOU CLEARLY LIKE THERE'S MORE DEMAND THAN SUPPLY. HOW DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE NUMBERS AND THE POTENTIAL? I KNOW IT'S A RELEVANT QUESTION FOR THE FOOD COMPANIES THAT I COVER. >>. TOTALLY, I DON'T THINK YOU CAN REALLY GET TO A REALISTIC NUMBER IN TERMS OF THE ADDRESSABLE MARKET. I MEAN THE POPULATION IN THE US OF $330 MILLION YOU KIND OF. YOU KNOW KIND OF HAD TO SEPARATE THAT INTO THE ADULT POPULATION, WHAT PERCENTAGE OF ADULTS ARE OBESE. CALL IT LIKE A THIRD. THAT'S KIND OF HOW THE MARKET MODELS ARE BEING BUILT. YOU CAN GET TO SOME ASTRONOMICAL NUMBERS IF YOU'RE WILLING TO TAKE THE BASE POPULATION WHAT YOU BELIEVE IS THE PERCENT OVERWEIGHT, AND THEN MULTIPLY THAT BY ROUGHLY A THOUSAND DOLLARS PER MONTH, WHICH IS THE GOING RATE OF THESE DRUGS. ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE PAYING OUT OF POCKET, IT'S VERY EASY FOR ANALYSTS AROUND STREET TO GET TO $100 BILLION PLUS. I KNOW THERE ARE SOME INVESTORS WHO THINK $100 BILLION BY 2030 IS ACTUALLY GOING TO PROVE TO BE LIGHT. BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU KNOW YOU GOT THE PAYER COMPLEX WHICH YOU GUYS TALKED ABOUT EARLIER. WHO IS GOING TO PAY FOR IT? ON THE OTHER SIDE, I THINK RIGHT NOW. I MEAN GOING BACK TO. YOU KNOW WHERE WE ARE IN MARKET ADOPTION. I DON'T THINK WE REALLY SCRATCHED. SCRATCHED THE SURFACE YET IN TERMS OF GETTING THE DRUG TO MIDDLE AMERICA, DIFFERENT REGIONS, WHERE THE OBESE POPULATION IS MORE PREVALENT BECAUSE AFFORDABILITY AND ACCESS. THIS IS BASICALLY A NEW YORK, LA MIAMI, TYPE OF DRUG FOR STARTERS, I THINK, IN TERMS OF BUILDING THE MARKET. IT'S REALLY POPULATION, MULTIPLIED BY SOME PRICE, BUT IT'S UNREALISTIC TO BE OVERLY LIBERAL, BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE PAYOR COMPLEX ON TOP OF THAT AND ACCESS AND MANUFACTURING AND CAN THE DRUG COMPANIES ACTUALLY MAKE ENOUGH TO YOU KNOW SORT OF SATISFY, THE DEMAND.",[7]

WHEN GMAIL CAME OUT, IT WAS IN BETA FOR FIVE YEARS. BETA IS A MARKETING CONSTRUCT. THEY'VE TRIED HOW GOOD GEMINI, PREVIOUSLY BARD CHAT WOULD BE.

THEY HAVE COMPANIES BEHIND THEM, TENCENT AND OTHERS PARAMOUNT, WOULD BE SMART TO DO A DEAL WITH THEM. THIS IS A COMPANY THAT WANTS TO KEEP THE STUDIO SELL OFF OTHER STUFF AND IS WILLING TO PAY A PREMIUM. IT MAY BE THERE, IT MAY NOT. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS. I THINK WARNER'S HAS TO LOOK TO COMCAST AND SEE IF BRIAN ROBERTS IS LOOKING TO DO A DEAL WITH THEM. OR I THINK THEY TRY TO CHUG IT OUT AND HOPE THAT THIS AD MARKET GETS BETTER AND THAT THEIR NUMBERS TURNAROUND AND SOME OF THE FREE CASH FLOW ACTUALLY ENABLES THEM TO INVEST IN THE COMPANY, WHICH IS WHAT THE STREET SEEMS TO DESPERATELY WANT OUT OF WARNER'S. THEY WANT A NARRATIVE. THEY WANT TO HEAR: HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GROW? CAN YOU WALK THROUGH TO THE EXTENT? PEOPLE HAVE SORT OF -- I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH YOU THINK IT'S REAL OR NOT- PARAMOUNT AND THE COMPANY COME TAFT JOINT VENTURE OF SORTS WITH PARAMOUNT AND PEACOCK. HOW THAT WOULD WORK >>. WELL, THE WAY I'VE HEARD IT DESCRIBED, AND THIS HAS BEEN REPORTED IN THE MEDIA. THE JOURNAL HAS WRITTENEN ABOUT THIS. THERE COULD BE SOME SORT OF COMMERCIAL COMBINATION OF THE PARAMOUNT PLUS AND PEACOCK, A TEAMUP TO GET A LITTLE MORE SCALE IN THE STREAMING WARS, BECAUSE PEACOCK AND PARAMOUNT PLUS ARE THE SUBSCALE LATE ENTRANTS TO THE STREAMING WARS. THEY'VE NOT BEEN DOING GREAT, THEY'VE BEEN DOING BETTER, ESPECIALLY WITH THE PEACOCK WILD-CARD FOOTBALL LAST QUARTER. BUT THIS WOULD BE A COMBINATION OF THE TWO UNITS. IT WOULD BE A COMMERCIAL PARTNERSHIP ALL THE WAY DOWN TO. IT COULD BE A BUNDLE. THEY MAY DO A DEAL WHERE THEY BUNDLE THEM TOGETHER, SPLIT THE REVENUE IN SOME WAY, AND THAT'S WHAT THIS ENDS UP BEING. BUT THIS COULD BE SOMETHING MORE WHERE THERE'S A COMBINATION OF THE UNITS OR SOME KIND OF A COMING TOGETHER OF THOSE TWO UNITS TO BETTER COMPETE IN STREAMING, WHICH IS TA BIG PROBLEM WITH ALL OF THESE COMPANIES >>. MATT FINAL QUESTION: WARNER BROTHERS DISCOVERY, THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN A QUESTION. WE'RE COMING OFF THE SALE -- OR I SHOULD SAY POST SPIN- OF THAT BUSINESS FROM AT&T. IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SELL THAT COMPANY, GIVEN THE TAX IMPLICATIONS OF THAT TIME BUT ONCE YOU GET PAST THECALENDAR, BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE RULES WORK, YOU CAN ACTUALLY SELL THE BUSINESS WITHOUT THE SAME KIND OF TAX PROBLEMS. DO YOU SEE THAT COMPANY GETTING BOUGHT OR DO YOU SEE DAVID SAL IS SLOV BEING A BUYER LONG TERM? >>. I THINK RIGHT NOW. THEY'RE OPEN FOR ANYTHING. THEY'RE OPEN ABOUT SEARCHING FOR DEALS. THEY SAID THAT ESSENTIALLY ON THE EARNINGS CALLS. ZASLAV SAID THAT THE STOCK IS SO LOW. RIGHT NOW THAT A PURE ACQUISITION BY ANOTHER COMPANY. THAT WOULD JUST BE A DISASTER FROM WHERE THIS COMPANY WENT TWO YEARS AGO BUT I -- YOU KNOW- AT SOME POINT THEY MAY NOT HAVE A CHOICE. IF THE ECONOMICS CONTINUE TO DECLINE, I THINK THAT THERE WILL BE SOME KIND OF A -- SOME KIND OF A- DEAL WHETHER IT'S, YOU KNOW- FALLING INTO THE ARMS OF COMCAST, WHICH IT SEEMS VERY HAPPY TO JUST SIT BACK AND WAIT FOR WARNERS TO HAVE MORE PROBLEMS, OR WHETHER IT'S GOING OUT --. I DON'T SEE THEM BEING ABLE TO BE PURELY INQUISITIVE, LIKE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GO AFTER A BIG COMPANY. I DON'T THINK THEY CAN. THEY HAVE TOO MUCH DEBT STIL.","[336, 482]"

HOW ABOUT -- FAR. ARE YOU WILLING TO GO TO GET THE DEAL APPROVED? >> WE WILL CONTINUE THE PROCESS. >>. ARE YOU CLOSELY WATCHING WHAT IS HAPPENING? >> YOU MUST BE WITH PIONEER AND CHEVRON. DO YOU THINK THOSE DEALS WILL GET DONE? IF YOU DO, WHAT YOU THINK OF THE RAMIFICATIONS FOR YOU? >> I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THOSE DEALS. TO MAKE A COMMENT, WE ARE PRODUCING OUR OWN ASSETS FROM THE PERMIAN BASIN. FOR THOSE DEALS TO HAPPEN IN A NEGATIVE OR POSITIVE WAY, THERE IS NO IMPACT. I DON'T THINK ANY OF THESE DEALS THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED TODAY CREATE ANY TRUST ISSUES. >>. ARE WE AT SOME MOMENT FOR AND MORE CONSOLIDATION. WE ARE LOOKING AT MORE COMPANIES. IS THIS THE BEGINNING OF SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO DO TO FOLLOW MORE CLOSELY >>. I DON'T THINK SO. THE BEGINNING WAS FROM OUR ACQUISITION OF THE EMBARGO. THE REASON YOU REQUIRE THAT IS CREATING VALUE FOR YOUR SHAREHOLDERS. YOU ARE DOING IT IN WAY THAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR ASSETS THAT MAKE YOUR ASSETS BETTER. YOU CREATE SYNERGIES FOR THEM. THEY PROVIDE YOU AN ACCELERATION TO THE VALUE OF SHAREHOLDERS. EVERY COMPANY THAT DOES IT IS DOING IT FOR REGIONS. I THINK THEY WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT. THEY HAVE A LOT OF COMPANIES THAT WON'T HAVE ANY DIFFERENCE MADE IN TERMS OF THE ABILITY OF SMALLER OPERATORS. THIS INCLUDES BIG OPERATORS FOR THEM TO CHANGE THE WAY THAT THEY OPERATE AT ALL >>. WE MENTIONED AT THE TOP BIG PLAYERS IN OIL AND GAS. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PRICE OF NATURAL GAS, DO YOU SIT THERE YOURSELF AND SAY THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE? DID YOU FORESEE THAT THEY ARE GOING TO DROP THIS LOW? WHEN DOES THIS HAPPEN? >>. I WAS SURPRISED WHEN NATURAL GASES WERE FIVE DOLLARS OR ABOVE. I WAS SURPRISE THE PRICES WERE BELOW TWO DOLLARS. I DIDN'T THINK THAT THIS WOULD HAPPEN. I THINK THIS IS A SHORT-TERM THING. I THINK THE APPROVAL OF LNG IS FROM ONE OF THOSE TERMINALS, I THINK ULTIMATELY THEY WILL IMPROVE THE PRICE OF NATURAL GAS HERE IN THE UNITED STATES >>. IS THAT HURTING YOUR STOCK IN ANY WAY? IS OIL GOING TO BE PART OF NATURAL GAS >>? FOR US, THIS IS LESS OF AN IMPACT THAN OIL. WE HAVE THE CHEMICALS BUSINESS THAT IS AHEAD FROM THE LOW FRONT. THE CHEMICALS BUSINESS USES GAS. WE CAN MAKE ORE MONEY AND CHEMICALS WHEN GAS IS LOW GASES AND HAVE SO MUCH OF AN IMPACT. OIL IS MPORTANT TO US CLEA.","[25, 150, 186]"

INVENTORY MANAGEMENT PLAYED A BIG PART, UPSTREAM IN SUPPLY CHAIN INSTORES AND THE TEAMS REALLY FOCUSED ON MANAGING COSTS.

THANKS FOR HAVING ME. YOU ARE RIGHT. IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO MAKE A CALL TODAY. WHETHER CHEVRON OR EXXON WILL PREVAIL. THE TERMS WERE SIGNED A DECADE AGO. I DON'T KNOW IF THE RIGHTS EXIST.

CHEVRON AND HESS SAID IT WAS CLEAR, THE TERMS OF THE JOATHE WAY THEY READ IT. I THOUGHT THE PART I FOUND ODD IS THE TIMING THAT LAPSED BETWEEN WHEN THIS WAS INITIALLY ANNOUNCED AND NOW EXXON MAKING A CALL THAT. THERE IS PARTS WHETHER THE PREEMPTIVE RIGHTS WERE, AS CHEVRON READ THOSE. THE TIMING IS AMBIGUOUS. IT SHOWS ME AGAIN THE PROBLEM OF DOING A DEAL LIKE THIS VERSUS THE OTHER DOMESTIC DEALS >>. WE HAVE TO GET INTO THE BUSINESS OF HANDICAPPING WHETHER THE DEAL IN THE CURRENT FORM HAPPENS, AND IF IT DOESN'T HAPPEN, WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THAT? >>. I STILL THINK THERE IS VERY HIGH CHANCE THAT CHEVRON ENDS UP WITH THIS AND IT SHOULD. IF THEY DEEM THE JOA DOESN'T HOLD UP AFOR THE PREEMPTIVE RI RIGHTS, THEY WILL NOT LET EXXON OR CNOOC BUY IT. I DON'T COVER HESS SEE HOW THAT STOCK WILL CONTINUE TO PROGRESS. IT WOULD BE INTERESTING. I DON'T THINK EXXON OR CNOOC WILL GET IT. >>. IS THERE A PAYOFF THAT COULD HAPPEN? COULD EXXON EXTRACT A PAYMENT FOR ALL THIS? >>. I THINK ABSOLUTELY. I THINK TO YOUR POINT. WE KNOW THAT CHEVRON HAS A 30% STAKE WITH X-AMOUNT OF OIL IN THE GROUND. THEY ARE ON TO THE 40FOURTH LEGF, THE MASSIVE PLAY. THEY HAVE A NUMBER IN MIND. EXXON OR CNOOC WOULD SAY: WHAT WILL IT TAKE FOR THE 30% AND ROLL IT UP TO THE TWO OF THEM. YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

WE DO HAVE SOME BREAKING NEWS OUT OF EUROPE CONCERNING APPLE. STEVE KOVACH IS HERE. HE'S GOT THE DETAILS ON THAT >>. THIS IS A $1.8 BILLION EURO FINE. THAT'S 1.9 IN CHANGE IN US DOLLARS AGAINST APPLE. THIS IS OVER APPLE MUSIC IN EUROPE. SPOTIFY FILED A COMPLAINT WITH THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION SEVERAL YEARS AGO. THIS IS ALL THE SAME STUFF THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT- JUST THE FEES THAT APPLE TAKES. APPLE'S INABILITY, OR RATHER, SPOTIFY'S INABILITY, TO CHARGE WITHIN ITS APP WITHOUT ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW GIVING APPLE THAT CUT APPLE'S RESPONSE HERE. THEY SAID THEY ARE GOING TO APPEAL THE DECISION AND THEY LAY OUT -- THERE'S A BIG BLOG POST OUT NOW FROM APPLE RIPPING APART THIS DECISION- BASICALLY SAYING THINGS LIKE SPOTIFY IS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE APPLE ECOSYSTEM BY PAYING BASICALLY NO COMMISSION FEES. BY KIND OF GETTING AROUND THOSE FEES. I TALKED TO ONE OF SPOTIFY'S LAWYERS ABOUT THIS LAST WEEK GUYS, AND THEIR POSITION ON THIS IS WELL. YOU KNOW, WE WANT TO PAY LESS FEES. OF COURSE, THEY WANT TO MAKE MORE MONEY BUT WHAT THEY ALSO SAY IS APPLE'S ECOSYSTEM WOULDN'T BE AS SUCCESSFUL WITHOUT THESE THIRD-PARTY APPS. THEIR POSITION IS: WE'RE ADDING VALUE TO THIS APPLE ECOSYSTEM TOO US AND A LOT OF OTHER DEVELOPERS CLEARY. THE EU AGREES MORE WITH SPOTIFY. THIS IS GOING TO BE ABOUT $1.9 BILLION US FINE FOR APPLE ASK T OF COURSE THEY'RE GOING TO APPEAL THE DIGITAL MARKETS ACT, THAT BIG MUSCULAR EU LAW OVER THERE. THAT'S GOING TO REALLY CRACK DOWN ON APPLE AND GOOGLE AND FACEBOOK AND SO MANY OTHER US TECH COMPANIES. THOSE RULES GO INTO FULL EFFECT. I'LL HAVE MORE REPORTING ON THAT LATER THIS WEEK. THIS IS JUST ONE BEAT IN JUST THIS BIG DRAMA BETWEEN THESE COMPANIES. >> IS THIS THE ONE WHERE THEY KIND OF WHITTLED IT DOWN OVER TIME? >> EXACTLY. >>. THIS IS BASICALLY THEM SAYING: YOU HAVE TO AT LEAST ALLOW THE DEVELOPERS TO HAVE THEIR OWN SUBSCRIPTION SIGNUPS WITHIN, INSTEAD OF SAYING YOU HAVE TO USE APPLE PAY FOR THESE THINGS TOO >>. THESE ARE SEPARATE CASES BUT RELATED, AND SO THE DIGITAL MARKETS ACT IN THEORY TAKES CARE OF A LOT OF THIS. WE'RE LOOKING HERE. >> THIS IS A MUCH BIGGER FINE. >>. IT WAS REPORTED 500 MILLION >>. THAT'S WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY. >> THIS IS MORE THAN DOUBLE WHAT PEOPLE WERE EXPECTING. >> IT'S MORE THAN TRIPLE >>. YOU HEARD ME OFF AIR. I WENT WHOA WHEN THE NEWS CAME IN. THIS IS A HUGE FINE, AND IT ALSO SHOWS THIS DIGITAL MARKETS ACT, VIOLATIONS OF THAT 10% OF GLOBAL REVENUE. SO $400 BILLION FOR APPLE, THAT'S A $40 BILLION FINE. IF THEY VIOLATE, OBVIOUSLY, THERE'S PROCESSES, THEY CAN GO THROUGH. SO THE FINES ARE HUGE. >>. AND I MEAN THEY'VE ALREADY CHANGED THEIR POLICIES ON THIS. THEY CHANGED THE POLICIES AT LEAST A YEAR OR TWO AGO BECAUSE JAPAN WAS MAKING NOISES TOO. >>. IT'S DIFFERENT, REGION BY REGION. WHAT WE'VE ALSO SEEN APPLE DO IS FIGHT THIS REGION BY REGION, JURISDICTION BY JURISDICTION. THE CHANGES THAT THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE TO COMPLY WITH THE DNA LATER. THIS WEEK IT'S ONLY GOING TO BE IN EUROPE, SO YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A DIFFERENT iPHONE EXPERIENCE AS A EUROPEAN CUSTOMER THAN PEOPLE IN THE REST OF THE WORLD. BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE SEE THOSE CHANGES AS EMBLEMATIC OF WHAT THEY MIGHT HAVE TO DO IN THEUS. WE'RE EXPECTING ANY DAY NOW THE DOJ TO FILE THEIR ANTITRUST LAWSUIT AGAINST APPLE, WHICH COVERS A LOT OF THESE SAME ISSUES. THIS COULD BE A TEMPLATE FOR WHAT WE SEE AROUND THE WORLD EVEN THOUGH, THIS IS HAPPENING NOW. >>. I KNOW APPLE DOESN'T BREAK THIS OUT, BUT I WAS LOOKING AT NUMBERS ESTIMATES OF WHAT THESE THINGS ARE AND AT LEAST ACCORDING TO THE VERGE SOME OF THE NUMBERS THAT THEY'VE LOOKED AT ON THIS, I THINK IT'S SOMETHING LIKE 1.8 -- OR 8.3 BILLION IN REVENUE. THAT WAS TAKEN IN IN APPLE MUSIC IN 2022.. IF YOU COMPARE THAT TO THE SIZE OF THE FINE, THAT'S A PRETTY HU HUGE CHUNK. >>. SPOTIFY'S ARGUMENT HAS BEEN. THEY HAVE THE ADVANTAGE THEY CAN AFFORD TO LOSE MONEY WHEREAS WE CAN'T, AND SO THAT'S PART OF SPOTIFY'S ARGUMENT AS WELL, BECAUSE APPLE HAS WAY MORE BUSINESSES THAN MUSIC AND IT'S NOT CHARGING ITSELF A 30% EITHER. >> APPLE'S SHARES DECLINE OF ABOUT 3/4 OF A PERCENT >> AND THERE WILL BE AN APPEAL AND THERE'S GOING TO BE MORE BATTLES. IT'S NOT OVER APPLE'S IDEA FOR COMPLYING WITH THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION RULES GOING IN EFFECT ON THURSDAY. APPLE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW IF THEY'RE IN COMPLIANCE WITH WHAT THE EC WANTS. SO IT'S GOING TO BE AN INTERESTING EXPERIMENT TO SEE. ONCE APPLE PUTS THIS OUT THERE. IF THE EC AGREES, YOU ARE IN COMPLIANCE. SPOTIFY AND SO MANY OTHER DEVELOPERS ARE SAYING HUH-UH, THIS ISN'T GOING TO CUT IT. >>. WE NEED APPLE FOR THE MARKET? >> YES, >>. AND IT HASN'T --. >>. OR NVIDIA, THAT'S FINE. >>.

YOU KNOW I THINK STRATEGICALLY IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE. WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IT IN OUR SHOP, QUITE A BIT, AND I THINK IN THE NEAR TERM THERE IS NO SILVER BULLET. IN THE NEAR TERM, THERE IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE SOME BUMPS IN AGREEING WITH THE TWO COMPANIES. YOU KNOW SPIRIT IT'S A LARGE MANUFACTURER AND OVER. I THINK IN THE LONG TERM YOU'RE GOING TO SEE SOME OPPORTUNITIES FOR SOME CONSOLIDATION WITH SYNERGIES AND SOME OPPORTUNITIES WITH MANUFACTURING AND THE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY. IT JUST, I THINK IT JUST- MAKES SENSE IN THE LONG TERM. WHO KNOWS WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN 2004, THE INVISIBLE HAND OF ADAM SMITH? THAT IS DUE, BUT I THINK THIS IS PROBABLY THE RIGHT THING LONG TERM >>.

I MEAN THEY'RE GOING OUT TO SPIN OFF DEFENSE OR KNOW THAT CAN JUST LIVE ON ITS OWN >>. YEAH, I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE CASE. YOU KNOW, I THINK PRE-PANDEMIC 80% OF SPIRITS SALES WERE TO BOEING. SO THERE'S A LOT OF VERTICAL INTEGRATION THAT IS GOING ON HERE AND I THINK THEY BOTH REALIZE THAT. AND PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE ISSUES WITH AIRBUS. YOU KNOW AIRBUS, I THINK, WILL EASILY BE ABLE TO IF THEY REPORT A BUYBACK, THE TWO PLANTS, THAT THEY PRODUCE PARTS AND THEN -- FOR THEM. I THINK THAT WON'T BE AN ISSUE AND I DON'T THINK THERE SHOULD BE A LOT OF REGULATORY ISSUES. THIS IS NOT AN ANTITRUST. YOU KNOW THEY USED TO OWN SPIRIT. THEY PRETTY MUCH MAKE EVERYTHING FOR BOEING AND IT IS JUST SORT OF THE LOGICAL CONCLUSION I THINK: >> TONY, WHAT'S THE LESSON, LESSON, LESSON HERE FROM -- THE ABOUT SPINOFFS AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THOSE, BECAUSE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DEFENSE CONTRACTORS HAVING VARIOUS KINDS OF PROBLEMS, AND I THINK A LOT OF INVESTORS ARE GOING TO SAY, OH, CLEARLY, YOU SHOULD SPIN THAT OFF >>. YEAH, I THINK. I GO BACK TO THE EXAMPLE. IMAGINE IF GM WERE TO HAVE AN ENTIRELY SEPARATE ENTITY. MAKE ALL OF THEIR -- FOR EVERY CAR THAT THEY MAKE AND FOR ALL INTENTS OF PURPOSES. THAT SORT OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN BOEING AND SPIRIT, AND SO I THINK IS A LOT OF IP. THERE'S A LOT OF INTEGRATION. YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT THE TRAVEL TO WORK ISSUE WITH WHAT'S GOING ON WITH BOEING AND HAVING TO REWORK, AND IT COULD HAVE ESSENTIALLY BEEN.

BRIAN, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT AGAIN, AS I POINTED OUT, SINCE THE DAYS OF THE GREAT FINANCIAL CRISIS, BANKS HAVE HAD TO FOCUS ESPECIALLY, ESPECIALLY, LASER, ON WHAT EXACTLY, IN YOUR MIND, HAPPENED WITH REGARD TO OVERSIGHT HERE, AND WHAT EXACTLY DO BANKS LIKE NYCB DO TO RESTORE THAT TRUST THAT LESLIE MENTIONED >>. WELL, USUALLY, WHEN YOU HEAR AN ANNOUNCEMENT LIKE THIS OUT OF INFORMATION, YCB AND AN INTERNAL VIEW UNDERWAY YOU MENTIONED EAR EARLIER, YOU ALMOST ARE ALWAYS GOING TO HEAR MORE BAD NEWS. SO UNWISE TO SPECULATE AT THIS TIME, MAYBE WHAT THAT BAD NEWS BE BUT WHEN IT COMES TO CREDIT RISKS, WHETHER YOU'RE DEALING WITH CUSTOMERS OF NYCB OR THE CUSTOMERS THAT I DEALT WITH WHEN I WAS A CHIEF RISK OFFICER AT DISCOVER, USUALLY MORE INFORMATION IS BETTER, AND THAT'S THE CASE WITH THIS NEW RULE THAT'S COMING OUT FROM THE CFPB REGARDING OPEN BANKING, AND THAT IT WILL PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION FOR LENDERS TO BE ABLE TO ASSESS THE CREDIT RISK OF THEIR CONSUMERS >>. WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THIS? BY ITS OWN ADMISSION IN THESE REGULATORY FILINGS, IT WAS SOME OF THE LACK OF INTERNAL CONTROLS AND RISK ASSESSMENTS AROUND THAT LENDING PRACTICE WITHIN THE BANK THAT HAS KIND OF LED TO WHAT COULD BE FURTHER DETAILS TO EMERGE ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN DOWN THE LINE AT NYCB. WHAT WILL THESE TRANSPARENCY -- PROPOSED TRANSPARENCY- RULES DO TO HELP THOSE LENDERS MAKE BETTER DECISIONS ABOUT LENDING? AND, BY EXTENSION, HOW CAN LENDERS BE MORE TRUSTWORTHY WITH REGARD TO STICKING TO SOME OF THOSE RULES TO MAKE SURE THE BANKS DON'T FACE THIS AGAIN IN THE FUTURE? >>. YEAH, SO WHAT THESE NEW OPEN BANKING RULES WILL DO IS GOING TO BE GREAT FOR BANKS AND CONSUMERS, BECAUSE WHAT THESE RULES WILL DO IS IT WILL ALLOW BANKS TO SAFELY -- ALLOW CONSUMERS TO SAFELY- SHARE INFORMATION WITH BANKS THAT WILL ALLOW THEM TO MAKE MORE FAIR AND MORE INFORMED UNDERWRITING DECISIONS. AND THE SPECIFIC INFORMATION THAT THIS RULE IS GOING TO CALL ON BANKS TO SHARE- AND WE EXPECT THE RULE TO BE FINALIZED SOMETIME THIS YEAR- AND, BASICALLY, THINK ABOUT THE INFORMATION YOU, AS A CONSUMER, GET ON YOUR CHECKING ACCOUNT OR ON YOUR CREDIT CARD. ALL THAT INFORMATION THAT'S IN THOSE MONTHLY STATEMENTS IN ADDITION TO THE INFORMATION THAT THEY MIGHT SEND YOU AROUND THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS. THIS WILL BE INFORMATION THAT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SAFETY AND SECURELY SHARE WITH OTHER COMPANIES. AND BY DOING SO, I CAN SEE THREE BENEFITS THAT WILL OCCUR FOR CONSUMERS. ONE: IT WILL BE EASIER TO SWITCH BANKS IF YOU WANT TO, BECAUSE YOU'LL BE ABLE TO TAKE YOUR INFORMATION WITH YOU. THAT WILL MAKE BANKS WORK HARDER TO KEEP YOUR BUSINESS. TWO, IT WILL BE EASIER TO BE APPROVED FOR A CREDIT CARD OR A LOAN, BECAUSE THIS INFORMATION THAT'S IN YOUR ACCOUNT IT HAS TO DO WITH YOUR ACTUAL INCOME AND EXPENSES. IT'S INFORMATION THAT'S NOT CURRENTLY IN THE CREDIT BUREAU REPORTS, WHICH A LOT OF BANKS USE TO UNDERWRITE CONSUMERS. SO WE CALL IT ORTHAGO. THIRD, IT'S GOING TO MAKE IT EASIER TO MANAGE YOUR MONEY, BECAUSE THESE REGULATIONS WILL ENABLE THIS DATA SHARING AND A NEW WAVE OF MONEY MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO COME OUT TO HELP CONSUMERS.

IN THE WAY THINGS WORK, DEPENDING ON WHICH OPERATIONS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, WHERE ONE HAND CAN KIND OF -- YOU CAN SORT OF WATCH THE OTHER AT THE SAME TIME. UNITED HEALTH CARE HAS BEEN DOING IT FOR YEARS. >>. WELL, LOOK, I HEARD THE LAST CONVERSATION. A LOT OF THIS CONSOLIDATION YOU SEE IN THE MARKETPLACE, THIS UNDER WAY ABOUT 15 YEARS, ACCELERATED AFTER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. THE RESULT: CMS MEDICARE MEDICAID SERVICE, SYSTEMATICALLY UNDERPAID DOCTORS, CERTAINLY FOR MEDICAID AND INCREASINGLY FOR MEDICARE DOCTORS- AND HOSPITALS LOSE MONEY ON MEDICARE LINES OF BUSINESS. WHAT THEY'VE DONE IN RESPONSE? CONSOLIDATED SOLD PRACTICES TO HOSPITALS, TO INSURANCE COMPANIES. THOSE ENTITIES USED THE SCALE ACQUIRED TO GAIN EFFICIENCIES AND DRIVE UP PRICES, COST SHIFT TO THE PRIVATE MARKET, PRIVATELY INSURED PATIENTS. CMS HAS BEEN AWARE OF THIS THE GOVERNMENT. WE WERE AWARE OF IT WHEN I WAS THERE, CERTAINLY CMS AWARE OF IT UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. DOJ BEMOANS, CMS AND OTHERS, I THINK ACCEPT IN, NOT APPLAUSE, ALLOWING TO DO SYSTEMATICALLY UNDER PAY. THE RESULT: THE 50% OF ALL MARKETS ACCORDING TO A SURVEY BY THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION ARE CONTROLLED BY ONE LARGE INSURER AND 50%- MORE THAN 50%- PHYSICIANS CONTROLLED BY ONE LARGE INSURANCE. 50% OF THE MARKET ACROSS THE US. YOU CONSIDER CONSOLIDATION. THESE ACQUISITIONS- PAC-MAN ACQUISITIONS- BOUGHT UP DOCTORS IN ONESIES AND TWOSIES A LOT UNDER THE RADAR >>. COULD A DEFENSE ON THE PART OF UNITED HEALTH. BE THAT MEDICAL LAWSUITS ARE THROUGH THE ROOF AT THIS POINT, OR IS THAT NEITHER HERE NOR THERE? NOT LIKE MARGINS ARE AMAZING BECAUSE THEY'VE MADE ALL OF THESE ACQUISITIONS.

CAME TO THAT HEALTH CARE GROUP SAYING WE DON'T WANT TO KPCOMPETE FOR PRIMARY CARE DOCTORS. THAT HEALTH CARE GROUP REFUSED TO DO THAT ALLEGED THINK FROZE THEM OUT OF NEGOTIATION. I DON'T THINK INSURERS RUN ON TIGHT MARGINS WILL BE PART OF THEIR DEFENSE. I THINK GO MARKET-BY-MARKET IF ALLEGATIONS OF SPECIFIC MARKETS HAVE TOO MUCH CONCENTRATION AND UNFAIR BUSINESS PRACTICES TAKING PLACE IN THOSE MARKETS. BUT IT IS THE CASE THAT INSURERS AREN'T DOING WELL EITHER. SEEING REIMBURSEMENTS DOWN UNDER MEDICARE AND MEDICAID PAP PROBLEM WITH SYSTEMATICALLY UNDER PAYING PROVIDERS THROUGH CERTAIN GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS, HOPING THAT THOSE PROVIDERS CAN MAKE IT UP IN OTHER PARTS OF THE MARKET. YOU SEE BUSINESS ARRANGEMENTS LIKE THIS ULTIMATELY INCREASE CONCENTRATION IN THE MARKET AS PEOPLE TRY TO REACT TO THE FACT. THEY'RE NOT PAID A FAIR WAGE ON CERTAIN SERVICES. LOOK AT HOSPITALS NOW AND LOOK ACROSS THEIR LINES OF BUSINESS. LITERALLY, THEY LOSE 10 TO 20% OUTSIDE OF CARDIOLOGY, UROLOGY AND OTHER HIGH-PRICED SERVICES AND OVER INVEST IN THOSE SERVICES. TOO MANY CARDIOLOGY TWEAKS IN HOSPITALS. ONE PLACE, THEY CAN MAKE MONEY >>. ALL THAT IS NONE IS THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO WORK, SUPPOSED TO GO WHERE YOU NEED HEALTH CARE. INFLATION, MODERATED- ALL WE TALKED ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO. IS THAT BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT? IS THAT ACTUALLY A GOOD THING? WHAT WE'VE SEEN WITH CMS AND WITH REIMBURSEMENTS >> WELL, LOOK, THERE IS SOME ARGUMENT THAT CAN BE MADE, THAT THE CONS CONSOLIDATION HAS DRIVEN EFFICIENCIES. YOU CAN DEPLOY SERVICES, INFORMATION, TECHNOLOGY, OTHER SERVICES, HELPING ROTO, REDUCE COS AND INVEES EFFICIENCY, COMING IN TO ACQUIRE DOCTOR PRACTICES, PRODUCED REFORMS, NEW BUSINESS ARRANGEMENTS, INCREASING EFFICIENCY- PART OF WHY INFLATION HAS MODERATED IN RECENT YEARS. BUT TALK TO THE DOCTORS THEY'LL ARGUE, AND HOSPITALS THEY ARGUE, GETTING SQUEEZED, LOSING MONEY ON A LOT OF GOVERNMENT BUSINESS. THEY'VE HAD TO MAKE UP FOR IT BY SHIFTING COSTS TO PRIVATELY INSURED PATIENTS. ONLY SO MUCH THEY CAN DO, ONLY SO MUCH COST THEY CAN SHIFT TO PRIVATELY INSURED PATIENTS. BEFORE YOU SEE TOO MUCH INFLATION IN EMPLOYER-PROVIDED INSURANCE. EMPLOYERS ARE PUSHING BACK. THAT'S HAPPENING IN MOST MARKETS. >> THEY'VE DEALT WITH -- PHYSICIANS THAT ARE A GROUP THAT MIGHT OWN AN IMAGING LAB OVER PRESCRIBING PROCEDURES. I MEAN THAT'S THE THING OF THE MOSTLY, IS IT NOT? IS THAT PART OF THIS? >> STARK PROVISIONS ARE NOW HAVE BEEN IN PLACE FOR DECADES. THE ABILITY TO SELF-REFER, REFERRING TO BUY A ROODOLOGY HAVE RADIOLOGY OWN YOUR OWN PRACTICE.

FTC IS WAKING UP TO THIS HARD TO POLICE BECAUSE A LOT OF ACQUISITIONS AREN'T IN BIG PURCHASES. THEY'RE LIKE I SAID PAC MAN ACQUISITIONS BUYING UP SMALL DOCTOR PLAQUES THAT FALL UNDER THE RADAR.

IT HAS BEEN AT THE CENTER OF QUALITY ISSUES AFFECTING BOEING 737 MAX GASTRONOMY NOW TO DISCUSS IS SHEILA KYLER OF JEFFRIES, SHEILA GOOD TO SEE. PUT IT IN PERSPECTIVE. WHAT IS THE PRESUMED BUSINESS LOGIC HERE OF BRINGING THE SUPPLIER IN-HOUSE? >>. IN A PERFECT WORLD, BOEING WOULD OPERATE BY ITSELF. SPIRIT WOULD BE AN OUT SOURCE SUPPLIER OF FUSELAGES. THEY WOULD EACH ENJOY PROFITS AND GO ALONG WITH THEIR BUSINESS. CLEARLY, DE CALVIN HAS SOFT AND HIS TONE OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS. GIVEN THE ISSUES WITH THE LAST CAROLINE INSTEAD AND IT SEEMS LIKE SPIRIT HAS TO COME IN, HAS TO BE BETTER MANAGE. SO WITH THAT WAYS A READ THAT THEY FEEL THE NEED TO HAVE MORE CONTROL. THEY HAVE TO SHOW THAT THEY HAVE THEIR HANDS DIRECTLY ON THE PRODUCTION AND SAFETY ISSUES. HOW WOULD IT PLAY? >>? I THINK, GIVEN THE FAA AUDIT IS IN WEEK 46,. THERE IS A DOJ INVESTIGATION. THERE IS CLEARLY A LOT OF MANUFACTURING MISHAPS GOING ON. BOEING HAS TO BRING SPEARED IN- HOUSE. WE DO NOT KNOW THE PRICE FACILITY WHICH THAT IT COULD BE A TAKEOVER OR TAKE UNDER AT THIS POINT, GIVING THE ISSUE SPIRIT HAS HAD >>. SPIRIT IS ALSO -- PART OF ITS BUSINESS IS A SUPPLIER TO AIRBUS AS WELL, THE PRESUMPTION IS THEY WOULD SEPARATE THAT OUT >>. ABOUT 20% OF SALES IS TO AIRBUS BUT THAT BUSINESS IS ACTUALLY LOSING 20 MILLION IN CASH OF THIS YEAR AND 150 NEXT. WHAT DO THEY SAY THAT FOR? LIKELY NOT MUCH. IS OUR BASE CASE ASSUMPTION: WHAT DO YOU DO FOR THE REST OF BOEING? WE ASSUME BOEING TAKES THE COGS IN-HOUSE. TAKE SOME ABOUT 10% PER FUSELAGE. THEY DON'T HAVE TO PAY SPEAR FOR BUT OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVE TO MANAGE THAT BETTER AND TAKE ON THAT WORKING CAPITAL MANAGEMENT. WRIST THEMSELVES. >>. IF YOU BOTTOM LINE AND TERMS OF WHAT IT MIGHT NEED FOR BOEING AND FINANCING THE ACQUISITION AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR THEIR OWN EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW >>. IT DEPENDS ON IF THEY ARE GONNA HAVE TO RAISE EQUITY. THEY ONLY HAVE 16 AND A CAST ON THE BALANCE SHEET. THEY'RE GONNA LOSE 2 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER. THAT TAKES THEM DOWN TO 14.. THEY NEED TEN BILLION TO OPERATE. THEY DON'T KNOW IF THEY WILL HAVE TO RATE EIGHT BILLION IN EQUITY OR EIGHT BILLION IN DEBT. WE THINK WE CAN DO IT WITH DATA AND CASH ON HAND. THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE INCREASED -- ANALYSIS OR NOT, WE PRETTY MUCH THINK IT'S THE WASHED BOEING'S FREE CASH FLOW AT THIS POINT. IF YOU WANT TO BE BULLIED, QUOTES HERE IN 1 MILLION FREE CASH FLOW TO 6%, YIELD BUT ESSENTIALLY A WASH. >>. RIGHT, YOU ARE REALLY ACQUIRING THAT FREE CASH FLOW. >>. YOU ARE TAKING SOMETHING IN- HOUSE- THAT IS BEING PROBLEMATIC- TO REMOVE ISSUES AND TWO UP AND PRODUCTION. WE THINK BOEING IS DOING SUB 20 MAXES IN FEBRUARY. THEY ARE TRYING TO GET 38, WHICH IS NOT HAPPENING. >>. WHERE DO YOU COME DOWN? OBVIOUSLY, THIS IS A HUGE SWING FACTOR IN TERMS OF BOEING'S EVALUATION. WHERE DO YOU COME DOWN ON IN TERMS OF THE LEG?

I THINK WE CAN EXPECT THE STOCK SOLD OUT IN AFTERHOURS TRADING AND KEPT RAISING PRICES. GENERALLY, SALES FORCE FORECASTS ARE ALWAYS VERY, VERY CONSERVATIVE BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE IT FROM ME. LET'S CHECK IN FROM MARK PENA TO GET A BETTER LEAD OF THE SITUATION. WELCOME BACK TO MAD MONEY. >>. JIM, HELLO FROM NEW YORK CITY. IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU. >>. I WISH YOU WERE DOWN HERE. IT WOULD BE TERRIFIC, BECAUSE WE COULD TALK ABOUT HOW THESE REVENUE NUMBERS ARE BEAUTIFUL AND WE COULD TALK ABOUT CO- PILOT. YOU JUST ANNOUNCED IT AND I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW ALREADY WHAT'S THE FERVOR FOR IT. >>. WELCOME ON OVER TO SALES FORCE TOWER. YOU KNOW WHERE WE ARE. I HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE EXCITED ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR COMPANY, ESPECIALLY WITH DALE -- DATA CLOUD- WE'RE SEEING THE FASTEST GROWTH OF ANY NEW PRODUCT THAT SALES FORCE HAS EVER HAD EVER WITH OUR DATA CLOUD >>. YOU TALK PERIODICALLY ABOUT BILLIONS OF QUERIES AND TRILLIONS OF QUERIES OVER LARGE PERIODS OF TIME. WHAT IS IT LIKE WITH THE QUERY BECAUSE IT'S BETTER. WHEN YOU SAID, 8% REVENUE GROWTH, 9%, WHICH TIRES ME, I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW ABOUT THE ACTUAL CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE >>. YOU CAN SEE, JIM. WE HAD A PHENOMENAL QUARTER WITH RECORDS AND CASH FLOW. WE'RE PROJECTING INCREDIBLE NUMBERS FOR THE YEAR. WHAT I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT IS THE TRANSFORMATION WE HAVE GONE ON IN THE ENTIRE COMPANY OVER THE LAST YEAR. YOU CAN SEE THAT PERFORMANCE OVER THE LAST 12 MONTHS IS BEYOND EXPECTATION. IT'S BEYOND ANYBODY'S EXPECTATIONS IF YOU LOOK AT WHERE WE WERE SINCE WE FIRST WENT ON THE SHOW IN 2008.. I DON'T THINK EITHER YOU OR I COULD HAVE EVER IMAGINED WHAT WOULD HAPPEN. NOW YOU SEE IT MOVING FORWARD AS THE THIRD LARGEST COMPANY IN THE WORLD, DELIVERING TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS OF CUSTOMER SUCCESS. IT'S REALLY ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAID: CUSTOMERS GIVING THEM WHAT THEY NEED. RIGHT NOW- AND THAT IS THE ABILITY TO IMAGINE THIS HUGE AMOUNTS OF DATA- THEY NEED TO DELIVER HIGH QUALITY EXPERIENCE >>. HUGE BUY BACK, HUGE DIVIDENDS- THAT'S SOMETHING I EXPECT TO SEE FROM MATURE COMPANIES. ARE YOU A HYBRID? NOW, SOME PEOPLE SAY: DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THE CASH >>. I THINK YOU KNOW THAT WE HAVE MANY STAKE HOLDERS AT OUR COMPANY- NOT JUST OUR EMPLOYEES, CUSTOMERS AND INVESTORS- AND WE'RE TRYING TO SERVE EVERYBODY. YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE YOU DON'T SUFFER ANY DELUSION, WHICH IS WHY WE'RE BUYING BACK. THIS SPEAKS TO THE SIZE AND SCALE AND COMPANY THAT WE BUILT WITH SALES FORCE. >>. TELL ME ABOUT HOW YOUR CO- PILOT IS DIFFERENT FROM ANOTHER CO-PILOT THAT I USE EVERY DAY >>. IT'S VERY DIFFERENT, BECAUSE OUR CO-PILOT USES OUR CUSTOMERS DATA TO MAKE DECISIONS. THAT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT, AS YOU KNOW, THAT DATA AND META DATA THAT SERVES SO MANY OF OUR CUSTOMERS, WHETHER IT'S AMAZON OR WHETHER IT'S IHG OR EVEN OPEN TABLE OR EVEN. YOU KNOW AN AMAZING COMPANY LIKE SCHNEIDER ELECTRIC. ALL OF THESE COMPANIES, THEIR DATA AND META DATA THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE COMPANY THAT ILLUMINATING OUR CO-PILOT IS DEEPLY INTEGRATED INTO THAT DATA. OUR SALES CLOUD, OUR SERVICE CLOUD, OUR MARKETING CLOUD, EVEN TABLEAU, EVEN SLACK. THESE ARE AMAZING WAYS TO TALK TO DATA. WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO GO AND TALK TO DATA AND PROVIDE INSIGHTS BECAUSE THAT DATA IS LIVING WITH US EVERY SINGLE DAY. THAT MEAN S WE'RE GOING TO GIVE THOSE COMPANIES A GREAT EXPERIENCE. YOU AND I HAVE MADE RESTAURANT RESERVATIONS BEFORE WE'VE EVEN SHOWN UP AT A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT RESTAURANTS, AND WHEN YOU GET THERE. IT'S A GREAT EXPERIENCE. BUT BEFORE YOU GET THERE, YOU'RE TRYING TO WORK WITH THE SYSTEM. DOES IT REALLY KNOW ME? DOES IT UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M TRYING TO ESTABLISH? WE'RE SEEING A LEVEL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE THAT IS SO USABLE, SO EASY TO UNDERSTAND, THAT OUR CUSTOMERS ARE HAVING THESE AMAZING BREAKTHROUGHS AND ABILITY TO RUN THEIR BUSINESS >>. LET'S PIGEON, HOLE YOU A LITTLE BIT. YOU'RE USING NUMBERS THAT TELLS YOU HOW YOU'RE GOING TO BE UP: 8 TO 9%, REVENUE GUIDANCE. PEOPLE SAY, OH NO, WE WANT 9,, 10.. HOW DO YOU APPEASE THOSE PEOPLE? BECAUSE WHAT I WORRY ABOUT IS THERE'S A WHOLE SHEET OF UNBELIEVABLE NUMBERS AND THERE'S AN EIGHT, BECAUSE THERE'S AN EIGHT. SUDDENLY, YOU'RE NOT MARK BENTIOFF. WHAT DO I DO ABOUT THAT? >>. IT'S BEEN AN AMAZING RUN WITH SALES FORCE. WE'RE ADDING HUGE SOFTWARE COMPANIES ON TO OUR COMPANY EVERY SINGLE YEAR. SO I MEAN WE'RE THE THIRD LARGEST SOFTWARE COMPANY IN THE WORLD. WE'RE NOW THE SECOND LARGEST IN JAPAN. WE'RE THE NUMBER ONE ENTERPRISE APP COMPANY IN THE WORLD. WE PASSED S & P AT THIS SIZE AND SCALE. I'M VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE ABILITY TO HAVE THE GROWTH THAT WE HAVE. THAT'S AMAZING. >>. THAT'S A REAL NUMBER. DO PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT'S THE REAL NUMBER? FREE CASH FLOW- THE COMPANY I WORK AT. WHAT WE TALK ABOUT IS FREE CASH FLOW, BECAUSE THAT'S THE NUMBER I GET. ONE LAST QUESTION: SCHNEIDER ELECTRONICS >> YEAR 25 FREE CASH FLOW, GROWTH >> I UNDERSTAND. >> PRETTY AWESOME. I THINK I'M PRETTY EXCITED ABOUT ALL OF THESE. >> I THINK IT'S GREAT. >>. WE CAN TALK ABOUT MARGIN IS UP. IT'S AMAZING. >>. I WAS JUST GOING TO TALK ABOUT CIG. THEY WANT SALES FORCE >> THEY ARE GREAT. >> ABSOLUTELY. THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT AT OPEN TABLE. WHY DOES SCHNEIDER NEED YOU? THEY'RE NOT. THEY'RE NOT INDIVIDUAL FACING. LET'S TALK ACTUALLY. ISG HAS HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF CONSUMERS WHO ARE WORKING AT OUR SERVICE AND WORKING WITH OUR CO-PILOT AND WORKING WITH OUR AI, WITH EINSTEIN. JIM IS DOING A MILLION TRANSACTIONS A WEEK- THE MOST AMAZING TRANSACTION SOFTWARE THAT DOES NOT ONLY PREDICTIVE BUT GENERATIVE AS WELL. AND BY TYING TOGETHER ALL OF THIS DATA AND META DATA, WE'RE REALLY DELIVERING TO CUSTOMERS LIKE IHG THIS ABILITY TO UNLOCK ALL THEIR TRAPPED DATA. YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT A LOT OF CUSTOMERS USE ALL THESE AMAZING SYSTEMS AND WE WORK WITH ALL THESE AMAZING COMPANIES, LIKE SNOW FLAKE AND DATA BRIX AND MICROSOFT AND AMAZON. A LOT OF THESE DATA SETS ARE TRAPPED. THEY'RE NOT PEOPLE WHO ARE USING THESE EVERY SINGLE DAY. THEY'RE DONE BY DATA ANALYSTS, OUR CUSTOMERS WHO ARE ON SLACK OR ALL THESE THINGS. WE HAVE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF USERS. WE'RE THEN ABLE TO TRAP THE DATA WE'RE READING, ALL THOSE DATA BASTES -- BASES. YOU'RE NOT GOING TOO MUCH YOUR AI SUCCESS IF YOU DON'T HAVE YOUR DATA AND META DATA TO DELIVER THE CO-PILOT >>. I AGREE WITH YOU. THE QUARTER WAS EXCELLENT AND I'M VERY GRATEFUL.

ONE OF THEM, STEVE STICK WITH US HERE. ALSO, JOINING ME ON THE CONVERSATION IS THE CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER AND A CNBC CONTRIBUTOR, AND MARK ZANLDY, CHIEF ECONOMIST AT MOODY'S ANALYTICS. PETER, I'LL START WITH YOU, JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE SITTING NEXT TO ME. THE COMMENTS. THE TAKEAWAY HERE IS MAYBE TRYING TO AGAIN TEMPER THE EXPECTATIONS THAT THE MARKET HAS, THE MARKET'S BEEN TEMPERED OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST THREE TO FOUR WEEKS. ARGUABLY, HAS ANYTHING REALLY CHANGED WITH THAT PICTURE? >>? NOTHING TODAY. I THINK POWELL JUST REITERATED WHAT WE HEARD FROM A LOT OF OTHER FED MEMBERS. HE'S JUGGLING SOME COMPLICATED STUFF HERE. IT'S NOT JUST OKAY, WE RAISED SHARPLY. WE'RE GOING TO TWEAK HERE AND THERE AND CUT A LITTLE BIT. I MEAN TWO-YEAR INFLATION, BREAK EVENS OR 50 BASIS POINTS OVER THE PAST MONTH. GASOLINE PRICES ARE AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS SINCE EARLY NOVEMBER. CONTAINER SHIPPING PRICES HAVE JUMPED. SO I MENTIONED THAT BECAUSE GOODS PRICES HAVE FALLEN SHARPLY BUT NOW ARE AT RISK OF REBOUNDING AGAIN, WHILE THE SERVICE SIDE COULD CONTINUE TO MODERATE WITH RENTAL PRICES, THE POINT BEING THAT THERE'S A LOT OF CONFUSING MIXED MESSAGES HERE. I DON'T THINK JAY POWELL- IT'S IN HIS INTEREST OR REALLY EVEN CAN PUSH THAT MUCH AHEAD IN TERMS OF EXPECTATIONS, BECAUSE HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW. I THINK HE DOES NOT WANT TO START CUTTING RATES AND WATCH INFLATION RISE. RIGHT BACK UP IN HIS FACE AGAIN AND HE -- WHAT'S BEING RESTRICTED? RIGHT, NOW, THE MARKETS ARE NOT BEING RESTRICTED. IF YOU HAVE A COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LOAN, YEAH, YOU'RE BEING RES RESTRICTED. BUT THE RESTRICTIVE OR NOT RESTRICTIVE POLICY IT DEPENDS ON WHO YOU ARE. >> MARK, THE CENTRAL BANKERS IN AMERICA AND EVEN FED CHAIR. JAY POWELL TODAY ALLUDED TO THIS. THAT THE STRENGTH OF THE ECONOM IS, WHAT IS LEADING TO THE ABILITY TO BE A LITTLE MORE PATIENT WITH REGARD TO THE ABILITY TO CUT INTEREST RATES OR HAVE TO CUT INTEREST RATES. DOES THAT STILL PLAY OUT? NOW, GIVEN THIS TRANSITIONARY, CONFUSING DATA THAT WE HAVE >> WELL, MY VIEW IS: THE ECONOMY IS RESILIENT, IT'S FINE, IT'S OKAY, BUT IT FEELS SOFT TO ME IN SOME KEY PLACES, THE JOB MARKET IN PARTICULAR. YOU LOOK UNDER THE HOOD. FOR EXAMPLE, TODAY WE GOT DATA FROM THE JOB OPENING LABOR TURNOVER SURVEY. YOU CAN SEE HIRING RATES ARE WAY DOWN FROM WHERE THEY WERE AND ACROSS THE BOARD, ACROSS ALL INDUSTRY. HOURS WORKED HAVE FALLEN SHARPLY, REALLY BACK TO LEVELS YOU DON'T SEE, EXCEPT IN A RECESSION. THE ONLY THING THE LABOR MARKET THAT IS KEEPING IT TOGETHER IS LAYOFFS ARE JUST EXTRAORDINARILY LOW. IT JUST FEELS VERY FRAGILE TO ME. AND THEN THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM, ALL THIS DISCUSSION AROUND NYCB. THAT'S SYMPTOMATIC OF A BROADER SET OF STRESSES ON THE SYSTEM. THAT GOES RIGHT BACK TO WHAT THE FED'S DOING. SO IT'S A BALANCE OF RISKS. IT'S A MATTER OF JUDGMENT. IN MY VIEW, THE RISK IS NOW HIGHER THAT THE FED IS GOING TO KEEP RATES TOO HIGH, TOO LONG, UNDERMINE THE ECONOMY AND THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM. A AND TO WHAT END. IN MY VIEW, THEY ALL BUT ACHIEVED THEIR TARGET AT 3.7% EMPLOYMENT. INFLATION IS COMING IN NICELY EXCLUDE THE COST OF SHELTER AND WE'RE BACK TO TARGET AND THEN SOME. SO WHY, WHY MAINTAIN THIS TIGHT POLICY IN THE CONTEXT OF AN ECONOMY THAT YOU KNOW IS, I THINK, A BIT FRAGILE? >> STEVE, CAN YOU PUT THE RISK/REWARD STORY ON IT FOR US? I UNDERSTAND WHAT MARK IS SAYING. I ALSO UNDERSTAND WHAT PETER IS SAYING, BUT THERE'S A CONVERSATION THAT'S BEING HAD RIGHT NOW, AMONG ALL OF THESE CENTRAL PLANNERS, ABOUT WHERE THE GREATER RISK LIES. IS IT THE FACT THAT WE COULD SET OURSELVES INTO A DEEPER RECESSION? OR IS IT THAT INFLATION REARS ITS UGLY HEAD IN A FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT WAY? ALL OVER AGAIN, WHAT'S THE BALANCE OF SCALES RIGHT NOW? >>. DOM, YOU'RE A REPORTER. YOU HAVE TWO SMART GUYS MAKING GOOD POINTS ON THIS AND YOU END UP IN THE MIDDLE HERE ON THIS, I THINK -- I LIKE PETER'S POINT, WHICH IS SOMETHING I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR A BIT, WHICH IS, IF IT AIN'T BROKEN, HOW MUCH FIXING SHOULD THE FED DO TO THE FUNDS RATE? RIGHT NOW, I DON'T KNOW THAT. I SEE ALL THE FRAGILITY THAT MARK SEES WE MAY HAVE HAD A BOUT OF ECONOMIC WEAKNESS IN JANUARY THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN MORE WEATHER RELATED AND ONE-OFFS THAN WE HAD ACTUAL GATHERING WEAKNESS IN THE ECONOMY. AND I ALSO THINK THAT THE FED'S LITMUS TEST FOR CUTTING RATES IS NOT THAT HEAVY RIGHT NOW. WE TALKED ABOUT THAT A SECOND AGO, THE IDEA THEY WANT A BIT MORE EVIDENCE. I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO CUT, BUT I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO CUT MODESTLY AND SEE HOW THINGS GO. I DO THINK THE BIGGER ISSUE HERE BEGINS WHETHER OR NOT, THE FED CAN DO THE MONETARY POLICY WALK AND DO THE REGULATORY CHEWING GUM AT THE SAME TIME. BY THAT I MEAN, CAN THEY WORK WITH THE BANKS- AND I MEAN THE TREASURY AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOTH AND OTHER BANK REGULATORS- TO GET THEM TO SHORE UP THEIR BALANCE SHEETS AND MAKE SURE THIS OFFICE REAL ESTATE THING DOES NOT BECOME SYSTEMIC RISK WHILE THEY TAKE THEIR TIME AND DO WHAT JUST THE ECONOMIC FUNDAMENTALS SUGGEST THEY OUGHT TO DO FOR INTEREST RATES. SO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S POSSIBLE, BUT IF THEY ARE INDEED WORKING, AS THE CHAIR SAYS, BEHIND THE SCENES WITH THE BANKS, WE CAN MAYBE TAKE THAT OFF THE TABLE AND SAY: YOU KNOW WHAT THERE'S GOING TO BE: LOSSES AND RISKS MAYBE SOME BA.",[124]

THERE WE HAVE A COMMITTEE MOVE TO GET TO AND IT'S A DOW COMPONENT AND IT'S McDONALD'S TELL US WHY. >>. THIS IS A TRADE. I REALLY LIKE THE TECHNICAL SETUP HERE. THE FUND MENTAL STORY SPEAKS FOR ITSELF. McDONALD'S IN DECEMBER HAD AN INVESTOR DAY AND THE PLAN GOING FORWARD IS TO GROW THIS COMPANY AT THE FASTEST RATE EVER. THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT VERY AMBITIOUS PLANS. THEY WANT TO GROW BY 9,000 RESTAURANTS IN THE NEXT THREE YEARS. THEY ARE AT 41,200.. THEY WANT TO GO TO 50,000.. THEY ARE HAVING INCREDIBLE SUCCESS WITH THE REWARD POINTS: LOYALTY PROGRAM AND APP USAGE. I AM REALLY LOOKING AT THIS FROM A FUNDAMENTAL AND TECHNICAL PERSPECTIVE. THEY INTEND TO HAVE 250 MILLION ACTIVE LOYALTY PROGRAM USERS BY 2027.. THAT WOULD BE UP FROM 150 MILLION. THEY ARE PUSHING MORE AND MORE OF THE DELIVERY BUSINESS OFF OF THE OTHER APPS AND DIRECTLY ON TO THEIR OWN. LASTLY, THEY JUST SURPASSED STARBUCKS AS THE LARGEST APP USAGE. THEY ARE AT 40 MILLION VERSUS 30 MILLION. THERE'S A LOT HAPPENING HERE. THAT IS TECHNOLOGICAL. IF YOU LOOK AT THE PRICE SETUP, YOU HAVE A STOCK ABOUT 297, 298.. IF YOU LOOK AT THE THREE-YEAR CHART, THAT WAS WHERE THE STOCK PEAKED OUT IN THE SUMMER OF 2023, AND IT SPENT THE LAST ALMOST NINE MONTHS CONSOLIDATING. I THINK IT WILL PUNCH THROUGH AND WHEN IT DOES, PROBABLY NOT MANY SELLERS WILL BE LEFT. IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS THAT THE 200-DAY HAS BEEN SERVING THE SUPPORT. THE 50-DAY IS NOISIER.

WALMART, AS YOU MENTIONED, THEY HAVE A HIGHER MIX OF FOOD BUSINESS, SO THAT CREATES A LITTLE MORE DURABILITY, A LITTLE MORE TRAFFIC FLOW TO THEIR STORES.

FOR YEARS WE USED GARBAGE- BELIEVE IT OR NOT- AS A PRETTY GOOD INDICATOR OF THE STRENGTH OF THE ECONOMY AND I GUESS, IN BOOM TIMES THERE IS MORE GARBAGE. THERE IS ANOTHER ONE ON, I THINK I-75,. YOU CAN COUNT THE TRUCKS GOING UNDER A BRIDGE ON ANY GIVEN DAY AND YOU CAN TELL HOW THE ECONOMY WAS BASED ON THAT. SO THERE ARE CERTAIN INDICATORS THAT SEEM TO WORK FOREVER. WHAT ARE YOURS TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW? >>. YEAH, I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT, JOE. I THINK WE HAVE 13 MILLION CUSTOMERS ACROSS EVERY SECRESECRETARY SECTOR OF THE ECONOMY AND THE SIGNAL IS LARGELY STRONG. WE SEE A STRONG INDUSTRIAL ECONOMY COMING OFF A GOOD YEAR WITH A GOOD FORECAST NEXT YEAR SMALL BUSINESS- VERY STRONG, I THINK THE ONE SPOT, OBVIOUSLY, IS HOUSING OUR TEMPORARY CONSTRUCTION BUSINESS WITH HIGH INTEREST RATES. HOUSING STARTS HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BIT SLOW ON THAT AND WE'RE FORECASTING A PRETTY CONSERVATIVE YEAR INTO '24 AND NOT PLANNING ON A BIGGER RECOVERY UNTIL '25. THERE >> THE OUTLOOK YOU GAVE WAS -- IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS YOU BOOSTED IT BY HOW MUCH, WOULD YOU SAY: >> WELL, WE'RE COMING OFF THREE STRAIGHT YEARS OF DOUBLE DIGIT REVENUE GROWTH, WHICH FOR US, YOU KNOW WE'RE AT LOW GROWTH INDUSTRY, SO THAT JUST GIVES YOU A SENSE OF THE STRENGTH. NOW WE'RE FORECASTING ABOUT 8% REVENUE GROWTH FOR '24..

ARE YOU AWARE OF THAT? >> YEAH, WE STARTED 11 YEARS AGO AND I THINK IT WAS IN THE LOW 30s WHEN I STARTED. SO WE HAD A REALLY NICE RUN, CERTAINLY FOR OUR INVESTORS BUT ALSO FOR OUR CUSTOMERS. OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE HAS GOTTEN BETTER, AND OUR EMPLOYEES- WE ADDED MORE THAN 15,000 JOBS OVER THAT PERIOD, AS WELL, >> $58 BILLION MARKET CAP BEFORE THE MOVE TODAY.

HE REALLY KNEW THIS BUSINESS. HOW MUCH IS THE WHOLE GREEN RECYCLING -- JUST THE WHOLE ETHOS. HOW MUCH DOES THAT PLAY INTO YOUR BUSINESS. RIGHT NOW I WOULD -- IF I RAN A GARBAGE COMPANY, I WOULD DO -- I WOULD PICK UP GARBAGE AND DO WHAT I NEEDED TO DO AS WELL AS I POSSIBLY COULD. I WOULD TRY TO DO SOME OF THAT OTHER STUFF BUT IF YOU MIND YOUR Ps AND Qs, YOU HAVE A PROFITABLE COMPANY. IF YOU JUST DO THIS RIGHT, DUMPSTERS RENT THEM, PICK THINGS UP, SHOW UP ON TIME. YOU'RE MORE IMPORTANT THAN A DOCTOR TO A LOT OF PEOPLE, I THINK. >> LIKE YOUR UTILITY. NOBODY PAYS TOO MUCH ATTENTION UNTIL IT DOESN'T WORK, AND THEN THEY'RE VERY INTERESTED.

A THIRD OF OUR FRONT LINE WORKFORCE IS UNIONIZED. WE'RE CERTAINLY PRO EMPLOYEE. THAT'S WHERE WE START. WE HAD A GREAT RUN THERE. OUR EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT IS AT AN ALL TIME HIGH, WITH 99% PARTICIPATION. OUR TURNOVER IS DOWN 400 BASIS POINTS AND THAT THIRD OF THE WORKFORCE THAT IS UNIONIZED.

AND THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT SAY THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM IS WALMART, AND KROGER AND ALBERTSON'S SHOULD BE ABLE TO SOMEHOW RATIONALIZE CERTAIN OPERATIONS AND BE ABLE TO COMPETE WITH WALMART, AND THAT'S THE TRUE THREAT TO CONSUMERS. >>. HI, JOE, HI, ANDREW, KATHY, HERE, THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. THIS IS A LONG ANTICIPATED LAWSUIT AND, AS YOU POINT OUT, THE FTC IS LOOKING AT A NARROW SLICE OF THE MARKET AND LOOKING AT THE IMPACT OF THIS MERGER ON LARGE SUPERMARKET CHAINS AND ARE TURNING A BLIND EYE ON THE SUPER STORES, THE COSTCOS AND WALMARTS. AND THEY ARE SAYING IT WILL BE ON THE LARGE SUPERMARKET TRAIN AND THE DATA AND THE RECORDS BEAR THAT OUT, THAT WE SHOULD BE IGNORING, THAT IN THE PAST IT'S TRUE CONSUMERS HAVE LARGELY RELIED AND THERE HAS BEEN DEMAND ON THE SUPERMARKET CHAINS AND WITH DELIVERY SERVICES IT MAKES IT EASIER TO ORDER FROM THE COSTCOS AND WALMARTS OF THE WORLD. >>.

IT'S JUST STATED AND YOU FIND: -- THIS IS A JOURNAL PIECE TODAY, OBVIOUSLY ""THE WALL STREET JOURNAL"".

WE WANT THEM TO GET HIGHER WAGES. IS THAT A LEGITIMATE CONCERN IN A MERGER THAT IT MIGHT MAKE IT HARDER FOR UNIONS TO EXTRACT HIGHER WAGES, OR ARE WE THINKING ABOUT CONSUMERS? ARE BOTH CONSTITUENCIES OKAY TO CONSIDER? >> ABSOLUTELY. THERE'S NO LIMITATION HERE. MOST MERGERS IN THE PAST HAS FOCUSED CONSUMERS.

STEVE, AS I CUSTOMARILY DO. I'LL START WITH YOU FOR THE BIGGER PICTURE. HOW IMPORTANT WAS THIS PCE? READ TO THE OVERALL PICTURE FOR THE FED AND RATES >>. WELL, IT'S SOMETHING THAT THEY HAVE ALREADY INCORPORATED SOME OF THE MARKETS, ALREADY INCORPORATED IT. IT WAS SPOT-ON IN TERMS OF THE ECONOMISTS TAKING THE CPI COMING UP WITH A GOOD ESTIMATE ON THE PCE, AND IT CAME IN AS EXPECTED, WHICH WAS HIGHER THAN EXPECTED, AND IT'S A REASON WHY THE FED IS BEING LESS AGGRESSIVE ABOUT THE IDEA OF CUTTING INTEREST RATES. AT THE SAME TIME, IT'S A NUMBER THAT MANY PEOPLE THINK IS A BIT OF AN ANOMALY RELATIVE TO THE TREND OF INFLATION COMING DOWN. I WAS VERY GLAD TO SEE THAT JAY HAD THIS CALL OF MAY RATE CUTS, WHICH WAS MY CALL, AND I KNOW HE THINK THERE IS'S MORE RISK AROUND IT. BUT LOOK, IF YOU GET IT BACK ON TRACK FOR A COUPLE MORE MONTHS BEFORE THE MAY MEETING, I DON'T THINK IT'S OUT OF THE QUESTION. IF YOU TREAT THIS AND THINK ABOUT THIS AS MORE OF AN ANOMALY THAN A TREND, YOU CAN THINK THAT MAYBE SOME TIME- LATE SPRING, EARLY SUMMER- THE FED COULD CUT RATES >>. IT'S GOOD THING. WE HAVE THE HORSE'S MOUTH TO TALK ABOUT THAT. RIGHT NOW WITH THAT IN MIND JAY, BECAUSE STEVE POINTED OUT THE EXPECTATIONS THAT YOU HAVE. IT MIGHT BE GOOD FOR US, FOR THE RECORD, TO HEAR JUST WHAT THE EXPECTATION IS FROM YOU FOR THOSE RATE CUTS, IF AND WHEN THEY HAPPEN, AND IF THE DATA THAT CAME OUT THIS MORNING REALLY DID ANYTHING TO CHANGE IT. EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW IT WAS BANG IN LINE WITH EXPECTATIONS. >>. YEAH, SO, DOM I GUESS. WHAT I WOULD SAY IS OUR OFFICIAL FORECAST, WHICH WE DID EARLIER THIS MONTH, WAS LOOKING FOR THEM TO GO INTO 25 BASIS POINTS ON MAY 1st. THAT WAS BEFORE THE CPI PRINT CAME OUT, WHICH IS HOTTER THAN EXPECTED, AS STEVE POINTED OUT, WE'RE STILL SITTING AT MAY. AT THIS POINT, I THINK THE RISKS ARE SKEWED TOWARDS. JOS JUNE, AT THIS POINT WE'LL HAVE TWO MORE PCE PRINTS BETWEEN NOW AND THEN TWO MORE EMPLOYMENT POINTS. SO WE'LL SEE WHAT THE DATA SAY GOING FORWARD. SO THE RISKS WERE SKEWED IN THAT DIRECTION IN TERMS OF TODAY. I DON'T THINK IT DID ANYTHING MOVING THAT MUCH IN TERMS OF TODAY. WE KNEW TODAY WAS GOING TO BE A LITTLE HOT IN TERMS OF PCE, AND IT HASN'T CHANGED OUR THINKING THAT MUCH. >>. THERE IS A CONSENSUS ABOUT MULTIPLE RATE CUTS THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THE YEAR AND MOST PEOPLE ARE TILTING TOWARD THAT CUT OF MAY-TO-JULY TIME FRAME. HOW MANY DO YOU THINK HAPPEN IN TOTAL? SOME PEOPLE ARE SAYING 100 TO 125 BASIS POINTS. IN 25-BASIS POINT INCREMENTS, THAT'S FOUR TO FIVE. WHERE DO YOU STAND? >>. YEAH, SO AGAIN, IF I LOOK AT OUR OFFICIAL FORECAST, WE'RE AT 125.. I THINK THE RISK IS SKEWED A LITTLE LOWER THAN THAT. MAYBE 100.. GOING 25 BASIS POINTS AT A CLIP TO GO 50, YOU REALLY HAVE TO SEE THE ECONOMY BEING IN TROUBLE. THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE SEEING AT THIS POINT.

AND JUST TO PUT THIS IN CONTEXT HERE, THIS IS A $2 BILLION US FINE AND 1.8 IN EUROS, AND YOU ALSO HAVE TO LOOK AT WHAT'S COMING THIS WEEK AND IN EUROPE IT'S GOING INTO FULL EFFECT AND THAT PUTS AT RISK 10% OF ANNUAL GLOBAL REVENUE FROM THESE COMPANIES. FOR APPLE, THAT WOULD BE 40 BILLION WITH A ""B"", AND IF YOU THINK THE $2 BILLION IS A LOT, AND TAKE A LOOK AT POTENTIALLY HERE, IF THEY'LL BREAK THE RULES, THAT WILL GO INTO EFFECT LATER.

IT IS ALSO INTERESTING TOO, BECAUSE THE WAY THAT APPLE FRAMES IT. THEY'RE NOT WRONG THAT THE INSTALLED BASE FOR IOS IS ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS WHY MANY OF THESE APPS GET THE TRACTION THAT THEY DO. WHAT'S KIND OF IRONIC THAT APPLE POINTS OUT IN THEIR STATEMENT THAT SPOTIFY HAS 56% OF THE EUROPEAN STREAMING MUSIC MARKET ALREADY. IF WHAT THEY'RE HINTING AT IS SPOTIFY IS ALLEGING ANTITRUST BEHAVIOR, WHICH IS THE ANTITRUST GUY WHEN IT COMES TO MUSIC STREAMING IN EUROPE, AND HOW EXACTLY DOES THE NEXT CHAPTER PLAY OUT IN THIS APPEAL PROCESS?

WE DON'T KNOW- APPLE DOESN'T KNOW IF THOSE IDEAS ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO FIT THE LETTER OF THE LAW THAT THE EC IS LOOKING FOR. SO WHAT THE REAL NEXT SHOE TO DROP IS WHEN THE EC SEES THESE PRACTICES IN ACTION, DO THEY START INVESTIGATING RIGHT AWAY. DO THEY START LOOKING AT APPLE AND SAYING: WE MIGHT FINE YOU THE 10% OF THE GLOBAL REVENUEIF YOU DON'T CHANGE X, Y AND Z. AND THAT IS THE LETTER OF THE LAW AND THAT IS THE RISK RIGHT THERE.

YEAH, SO IF YOU GO BACK TO LATE -- ACTUALLY EARLY 2021- THERE WAS A DEFERRED PROSECUTION AGREEMENT THAT THE DOJ AGREED TO WITH BOEING ON THE TWO PREVIOUS MAX CRASHES, AND PART OF THAT AGREEMENT WAS THAT IT WAS A $2.5 BILLION PAYMENT, IF YOU WILL. PART OF THAT WENT TO AIRLINES, PART OF THAT WENT TO THE FAMILIES OF THE FOLKS THAT LOST THEIR LIVES, AND PART OF THAT WENT TO THE GOVERNMENT.

THE BLOWOUT HAPPENED A COUPLE OF DAYS -- I THINK TWO DAYS- BEFORE THAT AGREEMENT ENDED. SO THE DOJ IS NOW LOOKING AND SAYING: HEY, DID BOEING VIOLATE THAT AGREEMENT?

THAT'S THE ARGUMENT, BUT FROM A KROGER'S STANDPOINT. AND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT, WHEN WE LOOK AT COMPETITION, YOU KNOW OUR NUMBER ONE COMPETITOR IS WALMART. OUR NUMBER TWO COMPETITOR IS COSTCO. OUR BIGGEST INCREASING COMPETITOR IS AMAZON, AND YOU HAVE THE DISCOUNT STORES, RESTAURANTS AND EVERYTHING. AS YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN AROUND THE INDUSTRY FOR A LONG TIME AND THE INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO CHANGE EVERY YEAR. AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE COMPETITORS AND WHERE PEOPLE EAT AND HOW PEOPLE EAT, IT'S CONSTANTLY CHANGING. AND THIS MERGER ALLOWS US TO BE PROACTIVE. PROTECT. UNION JOBS CONTINUE TO GROW UNION EMPLOYMENT- AS YOU KNOW, WE'VE ADDED OVER $100,000 UNION ASSOCIATES OVER THE LAST 11 YEARS. WHILE MOST COMPANIES ACROSS, THE INDUSTRY HAS CONTINUED TO DECLINE IN UNION EMPLOYMENT. IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE YOU KNOW, WHERE WE ALWAYS APPRECIATE THE ENGAGEMENT AND THE CONVERSATION, BECAUSE WE FEEL VERY STRONGLY THAT IT'S GOOD FOR CUSTOMERS, VERY GOOD FOR ASSOCIATES AND COMMUNITIES >>. I GET THAT WALMART ORBVIOUSL IS A BIG COMPETITOR FOR YOU GUYS, AND SO IS COSTCO BUT IN THE COMPLAINT FROM THE FTC, THEY CITE KROGER, KPO'S DIRECTORS, CALLING ALBERTSON'S AS OUR NUMBER ONE DIRECT COMPETITOR >>. I DON'T KNOW WHO THE DETAILS OF WHO SAID THAT. I OBVIOUSLY WOULDN'T HAVE SAID IT, BECAUSE WALMART HAS BEEN OUR NUMBER ONE COMPETITOR FOR WELL OVER TEN YEARS. COSTCO HAS BEEN OUR NUMBER TWO COMPETITOR FOR A LONG TIME, SO I DO NOT KNOW THE SPECIFICS.",[217]

Biden's economic record",CNBC Television,2024-03-05 15:17:14+00:00,"FUNDED BY THE INFRASTRUCTURE LAW FROM 2021.. JOINING US NOW TO TALK ABOUT THAT AND SOME OTHER KEY ISSUES: TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY, PETE BUTTIGIEG, IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU. MR SECRETARY, CAN WE START WITH FAA-TYPE STUFF? THEN WE'LL GET TO THIS POLITICS STUFF A LITTLE BIT LATER. TOMORROW'S --- THURSDAY- IS A BIG NIGHT. WE UNDERSTAND THAT AND WE'LL GET TO THAT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. BUT NUMBER ONE: I GUESS JETBLUE, YOU AGREE WITH THAT. THAT IT'S GOOD FOR CONSUMERS. THAT THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN WITH SPIRIT >>. YEAH, WE WEIGHED IN AS A DEPARTMENT TO BACK UP THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, LARGELY BECAUSE OF CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED OVER THE YEARS IN THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY. YOU KNOW BACK AT THE TIME OF THE DEREGULATION, IT WAS CONFIDENTLY PREDICTED THAT THERE WOULD BE ABOUT 100 MAJOR COMPETITIVE AIRLINES IN THE UNITED STATES BY THE TURN OF THE CENTURY. OBVIOUSLY, THINGS WORKED OUT DIFFERENTLY. WE HAVE HAD FEWER AND FEWER AIRLINES, MORE AND MORE CONCENTRATION, MORE AND MORE CONSOLIDATION, AND THAT HAS AN AFFECT ON CONSUMERS. SO JUST LIKE ACROSS THE ADMINISTRATION, WE'RE TAKING A TOUGHER LINE ON ANTI-TRUST, REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING TO CONSUMERS IN ANY SECTOR, INCLUDING TRAVEL AND TOURISM. THIS IS ONE WHERE WE HAD A LOT OF CONCERNS STOOD WITH DOJ AND I THINK RIGHT NOW HAVING MORE AIRLINES RATHER THAN LESS AIRLINES. MORE COMPETITION RATHER THAN LESS COMPETITION IS GOOD FOR PASSENGERS >>. THE LATEST ON THAT OTHER ISSUE WE TALKED ABOUT AND IT'S NOT SPIRIT AIRLINES, SPIRIT AEROSYSTEMS, SO IT GETS A LITTLE BIT CONFUSING, BUT THERE'S SOME TALK. MAYBE BOEING JUST FINALLY BUYS SPIRIT BACK IN, BUT AT THIS POINT THE FAA, I THINK, HAS BEEN VISITING BOTH COMPANIES AND IT'S GOING TO CONTINUE ON-SITE PRESENCE AT BOTH BOEING AND SPIRIT. WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN? DO THEY REPORT BACK TO YOU ON WHAT THEY'RE FINDING? HOW DO YOU FIX QUALITY ISSUES THAT SEEM LIKE THEY MIGHT BE MORE THAN JUST A ONE-OFF >>. THERE WAS AN INTENSE ROUND OF VISITS. WE HAD FAA BOOTS ON THE GROUND. A FEW DAYS AGO, THE ADMINISTRATOR MET WITH THE SENIOR LEADERSHIP OF BOEING, COMMUNICATED SOME REAL CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT SEEMS TO BE THEIR INABILITY TO COMPLY WITH THE KIND OF QUALITY CONTROL PRACTICES THAT FAA EXPECTS OF THEM, AND GAVE THEM 90 DAYS TO PRESENT A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN AND SHOW HOW THEY'RE GOING TO MOVE FORWARD TO CURE THESE ISSUES. LOOK, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS OBVIOUSLY OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE, AND WE'RE GOING TO COME AT ALL OF THIS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF SAFETY. IT IS NO ACCIDENT, NO PUN INTENDED. IT'S NO ACCIDENT THAT WE HAVE GONE 15 YEARS WITHOUT A FATAL CRASH OF AN AIRLINER. THAT'S THE RESULT OF AN EXTREMELY RIGOROUS STANDARD WHEN IT COMES TO NOT JUST THE WAY THESE PLANES ARE DESIGNED, NOT JUST THE WAY THEY'RE FLOWN BUT ALSO THE WAY THAT THEY'RE MANUFACTURED. ANYTIME SOMETHING'S OUT OF COMPLIANCE. THAT PUTS THAT RECORD AT RISK. WE NEVER TAKE FOR GRANTED THAT THERE'S THIS INCREDIBLE FACT OF FLYING THROUGH THE AIR IS ACTUALLY THE SAFEST WAY TO TRAVEL IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. KEEPING IT THAT WAY IS GOING TO REQUIRE BOEING TO STEP UP AND FAA TO KEEP BOEING UNDER A MICROSCOPE INCLUDING THIS: YOU KNOW TOUGH STEP- THAT WAS UNPRECEDENTED- OF LIMITING HOW MANY AIRCRAFT THEY CAN PRODUCE IN A MONTH, UNTIL THEY CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT IF THEY WANT TO DO A HIGHER NUMBER, THEY CAN DO IT SAFELY. >>. BOEING GOT A BIG ORDER YESTERDAY FROM AMERICAN AND MAYBE THEY CAN GET THROUGH ALL OF THIS BUT IT'S BEEN A TOUGH COUPLE OF YEARS. THE STOCK IS DOWN ABOUT 50% OR SO. IT'S AN IMPORTANT COMPANY, MAYBE ONE OF OUR GREATEST MANUFACTURING COMPANIES IN THIS COUNTRY. MR SECRETARY, WHAT DO THEY NEED TO DO? DO YOU THINK THAT IT MAKES SENSE IF THEY WERE TO BUY SPIRIT AEROSYSTEMS BACK? IS THAT A BETTER WAY TO HANDLE THESE ISSUES? >>. YOU KNOW I HAVEN'T WEIGHED IN ON THEIR BUSINESS STRUCTURE. I THINK FOR THEM THAT'S A BUSINESS DECISION FOR US. ANY INTEREST WE HAVE IN THAT HAS TO DO WITH SAFETY. YOU'RE RIGHT, THE ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE OF THIS COMPANY IS ENORMOUS. NOT LONG AGO I WAS IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST. I WAS IN VANCOUVER, WASHINGTON, MEETING WITH HIGH SCHOOLERS WHO WERE IN A TECH PROGRAM TOGET THEM READY FOR THE TRADES, AND ONE OF THE STUDENTS SAYS -- WE WERE ASKING THEM WHAT THEY WERE UP TO. ONE OF THE STUDENTS' EYES LIT UP WHEN HE LET US KNOW THAT HE WAS ABOUT TO HAVE HIS SECOND ROUND OF COMPETING FOR AN INTERNSHIP TO GO WORK AT BOEING. WE KNOW HOW IMPORTANT THAT THAT IS FOR THE ECONOMY BUT REALLY, ON OUR SIDE OF THE HOUSE, AND CERTAINLY FAA'S SIDE OF THE HOUSE, IT'S 1 HU00% A CONVERSAT ABOUT SAFETY AND DOING THE RIGHT THING ON SAFETY AND HAVING THE RIGHT SAFETY CULTURE IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S GOING TO BE NECESSARY FOR THE LONG-TERM HEALTH OF BOEING AS A BUSINESS TOO. >>. WE'LL SWITCH GEARS NOW. ON THURSDAY WE WILL HEAR THE STATE OF THE UNION FROM THE PRESIDENT, AND THERE HAVE BEEN SOME EXPECTATIONS BUILT UP, I THINK, AMONG DEMOCRATS AND PRESIDENT BIDEN'S SUPPORTERS, THAT IT'S AN IMPORTANT STATE OF THE UNION BUT WE'RE IN VERY OBVIOUSLY DIVISIVE TIMES, VERY STRANGE TIMES. IF YOU LOOK AT THE GDP, I KNOW YOU COULD BRING THAT UP- HOW WELL WE'VE SEEN GROWTH HOLD UP WHEN WE THOUGHT A RECESSION WAS COMING. WE'VE SEEN UNEMPLOYMENT WELL BELOW HISTORIC LEVELS, AT HISTORIC LOWS, AND FREQUENTLY IT'S BEEN POINTED OUT THE DISCONNECT BETWEEN HOW THE ECONOMY IS DOING NEW HIGHS IN THE STOCK MARKET AND THE PERCEPTION OF THE JOB PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS DONE ON THE ECONOMY. AND I KNOW YOU -- YOU HAD TO HAVE SEEN THESE POLLS THIS WEEK. THEY WERE KIND OF STAGGERING, KIND OF SHOCKING FROM THE LIKES OF THE ""NEW YORK TIMES"" OR CBS OR IPSOS, IN TERMS OF NOT ONLY NOT GIVING THE PRESIDENT CREDIT BUT REALLY NASA- 18% SAY THE PRESIDENT'S POLICIES HAVE BENEFITED THEM ECONOMICALLY. EVEN AMONG WOMEN- 20% MORE SAY TRUMP'S POLICIES BENEFITED THEM THAN BIDEN'S. WHAT DO YOU ATTRIBUTE THAT AND HOW DO YOU FIX THAT? >>. YOU'RE RIGHT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS ACROSS OUR ECONOMY: ALL-TIME HIGHS IN THE STOCK MARKET, RECORD JOB CREATION UNEMPLOYMENT- THAT HASN'T BEEN THIS LOW FOR THIS LONG SINCE BEFORE I WAS BORN. YOUSEE SO MANY GOOD THINGS HAPPENING THAT WE WANT TO TELL THE STORY FOR- AND I'M ONE OF THOSE WHO DEFINITELY BELIEVES THE PRESIDENT DESERVES MORE CREDIT FOR THOSE ACHIEVEMENTS. PART OF HOW YOU DO THAT IS: YOU'VE GOT TO GO OUT THERE AND TAKE CREDIT FOR THOSE ACHIEVEMENTS. I THINK YOU'LL SEE THE PRESIDENT IN THE STATE OF THE UNION TALKING ABOUT WHAT'S BEEN ACHIEVED. YOU'LL DEFINITELY SEE CABINET MEMBERS LIKE ME CONTINUING TO GO OUT ACROSS THE COUNTRY POINTING TO THE PROJECTS THAT ARE GETTING DONE. THE BRIDGE BEING REDONE IN MINNESOTA, WISCONSIN, IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE OUT OF 40,000 THAT WE'RE HIGHLIGHTING RIGHT NOW. BUT LOOK, PEOPLE ARE ALSO FRUSTRATED, AND I GET IT. PEOPLE ARE GENERALLY FRUSTRATED WITH THE NEGATIVITY THEY SEE EVERY TIME. THEY SEE CONGRESS OF WASHINGTON. THAT'S WHY CONGRESS HAS AN APPROVAL RATING RIGHT NOW. LAST TIME I CHECKED IN THE 20s. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HIGHLIGHT THE THINGS THAT ARE GOING RIGHT AND CONTINUE TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE THINGS THAT ARE GOING WRONG AND LAY OUT THE PLAN AND MAKE CLEAR WHO'S TRYING TO GET PROGRESS AND WHO'S TRYING TO ACTUALLY SOLVE THOSE PROBLEMS, VERSUS JUST USE THEM TO SCORE POLITICAL POINTS. I MEAN IT WAS ESPECIALLY DISAPPOINTING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE BORDER. YOU'VE GOT CONGRESSIONAL GOP TALKING ABOUT THE BORDER. EVERY CHANCE THEY GOT. SO YOU WOULD THINK THAT THEY WOULD BE INTERESTED IN ADDRESSING IT AND YET, WHEN A BIPARTISAN BILL PUT TOGETHER BY ONE OF THE MOST CONSERVATIVE MEMBERS OF THE SENATE AND DEMOCRATS WORKING, NEGOTIATING, MAKING TOUGH TOUGH DECISIONS THAT BOTH OF THEIR RESPECTIVE BASES WERE GOING TO HAVE TROUBLE WITH CAME AND HAMMERED. THAT OUT IT LOOKED LIKE THERE WAS GOING TO BE A CHANCE TO DO SOMETHING REAL WITH REAL RESOURCES, AT THE BORDER, ONLY FOR DONALD TRUMP, WHO'S NOT EVEN AN ELECTED OFFICIAL.",[78]

I'm here with James dmer, Main Street research, Chief investment officer. thanks for being here, appreciate it. so we're talking about two stocks today that are down year to date, and let's talk about your buy stock first of all, and this is one that we have talked about a lot on the program. it's Apple. the shares are down about 10% or so year to date. so let's talk about why you still like it, and part of it is because it is down from the high. so good Val, good value right now. yeah, Julie, it's down from the high. it's getting no love whatsoever from Wall Street and, in fact, the short interest, the amount of people shorting the stock- has increased quite a bit, and we think that's an opportunity, mainly for the underlying you know things. I think that investors are misunderstanding about Apple. where are they going really in this, what we call the new tech, Le AI bull market. it looks like they're left behind, but I think investors are mistaken that know that's coming in the next quarter or two. okay, so let's dig into that a little bit here, because you know Apple has teased what might be coming here. there's been a lot of focus on some negatives and some perceived negatives, like slowing sales in China, but you think that the AI Tech is coming. what gives you that confidence? yeah, I think the China sales is moderating. first of all, I think investors should get used to that and I think it's in the stock price at this point. um, what we think is exciting and if you, if someone missed, Nvidia or any of the semiconductors have been the really hot stocks that led AI in the first phase. this is where you want to go now, because the next phase is: where does AI sort of make a difference? and we think the iPhone is what's going to be carrying AI over the next quarter. two and three. first, it starts with AI subscriptions, probably in Q2. I don't think the street is putting that in the price of the stock here and we think those subscriptions on a 200 million doll, two, 200 million users- can be very significant to earn. let me just stop you right there, because what does that mean? like meaning there would be something chat, GPT, like that apple is offering as a subscription service on on uh devices. I think like a Siri. that's really incredible. right, Siri right now is- is PR not incredible? um, we think that the AI subscript to to Apple is going to be that on steroids, so you're really going to be able to talk to your phone. it's going to be telling you what to do. in that first phase, subscription, of course, service is good for them, reoccurring revenue for a long time. so that'll be the first phase. we think that rolls out in Q2- interesting. Q3 is really exciting because that's going to be uh iPhone 16. we think it's going to be a phone that people are going to need to buy because it's new hardware that can run this AI. so that's another very exciting product cycle. well, James, I don't want to hear that, cuz I just bought the 50. but let's get to your last Point here, which is sort of the investment strategy and the redeployment of capital. you think that's going to AI, just after they, for example, stopped their whole car Endeavor. so why was that a good decision and why is it? why is it good what they're doing with that money? you know, if you think about meta, did that? you know the era of efficiency, you know reducing costs. I think that's what Apple's doing here. they're saying, you know, let's give up on the driverless car and the 1010 billion that we threw at that, let's refocus. where are they refocusing it? AI. so we think that's a very smart thought process they're going through of, hey, let's think about Dollar in, dollar out, where is going to be most profitable? really, love that they're doing that. stocks 25 times earnings, right, um, I think that's wrong. I mean the PE, right, the E is estimated, uh, to be a certain number by the street. we think that e is too low, so the PE today actually may be lower in hindsight as we go forward in the next few quarters. we always like to put out a potential risk to this upside case and in the case of Apple, it's that they don't bring this stuff to fruition soon enough. that's exactly what the risk is. I mean, I think that if they don't, um, make magic happen in the next few quarters, um, and I think it's the AI, uh, play um the stock definitely Obe at risk, uh, because then you're going to have the China moderated sales on top of no real reason to get the 16. um, yeah, I think the stock would be in trouble. okay, gotcha, all right, let's get to your stock that you do not like. it's another one that's down your to date and it's down quite a bit more than Apple. I'm talking about Boeing. those shes down more than 20% of your to dat. but you say no, you don't want to get in here. let's talk about why. first of all, there's sort of the obvious here. what's been going on production wise at the company? yeah, I mean, you know, it takes decades to build a great reputation- Julie, you know that- and it takes moments to ruin it, and I think this is what's going on. this is the story with Boeing. um, and it's really a management problem. um, they've had mistake after mistake, some of them to say mistakes over over the, over the last two years, and, um, that is really making the Institutional Investor sort of walk, walk away, and that's why the stock is down. now a lot of people think it's cheap. um, you know, because it's down a lot, we think that is a value trap and we can talk about valuation in just a moment. yeah, let's do that. then let's talk about the valuation. you know, here's a company in the last 12 months that's lost money. I mean, this is an AI tech-led new bull market. that is not really where you want to be. AI can't save their valuation, right, um? but going forward, the street suggests that you're looking at the price relative to the earnings. you look at that. the streets are estimating the earnings to be to PE to about 60 times earnings. you know the S&P 500 is trading about 21 times earnings. here's a stock three times as expensive as the average company. it's losing money. it's got a real reputation problem. I would stay away from EV valuation. well, and let's get to the last one here, which is competition: Airbus. of course, it's big competitor, not suffering from these same issues. you know Airbus has got that reputation down. you know they've really, uh, been able to be very consistent. now, one problem with Airbus is they they're pretty, but book for for a long period of time. um, but I think investors should recognize when companies have one of their biggest competitors have a problem, like Boeing does. Airbus very well, may come out with a new way to produce more planes sooner. so I think that that comp competitive advantage that Airbus has could be a threat to Boeing. another reason I don't want to own the stock. okay, one thing that maybe would draw you in: if the stock kept going down with the, would it get more attractive? you know, I don't want to use the pun, the you know the plane crashes here. but if the stock crashes- right, I mean stock literally went down by 50%- I think investors then say, Hey, you know, maybe there's value now relative to book value, the amount of the number of the planes and the future potentially getting brighter, but the stock would really have to come way down and be less than a market multiple gotcha. all right, and just to be clear here, you own Apple shares. if I'm not mistaken, we own Apple shares as a firm and as a as my family. yes, okay, but you don't own Boeing, no, no, all right. let's summarize what you're telling investors here today, James: by Apple, based on its current price, i' likely Blockbuster, anoun some point- and solid investment strategy, avoid Boeing for its poor management, current valuation and potential loss of market share. James, thanks so much for being here, appreciate it. thanks, jul, and thank you for watching. goodbye or goodbye, we're going to bring you new episodes three times a week at 3:30 pm Eastern.","[1, 78]"
117,uoTKkw9ic7c,Walmart's 3-for-1 stock split goes into effect,Yahoo Finance,2024-02-26 15:43:00+00:00,"time for today's stock to watch and that is Walmart 3 for one stock split going into effect today after closing at 17556 on Friday. now pre-market trading, accounting for the stock split, with the retail giant trading just around 59 here in pre-market activity. Yahoo finances, Madison Mills, is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with the breakdown. Madison, yeah, Shauna. so folks here at NY reminding me and our viewers to not spit out your coffee when you see that Walmart is trading near 60 bucks a share heading into the market open, coming up in about 15 minutes here. that lowered share price is going to be due to exactly what you mentioned: that three for one stock split. and this comes, as the CEO was saying on the earnings call, that it was important to the Walton family always that, uh, the stock was accessible for employees. remember that Walmart is the largest employer in the US and certainly the largest brick-and mortar retailer as well. so that's part of the reason that's driving this stock split. it's also another one of the companies this earning cycle upping their dividends- a 9% hike. so you're going to get about 83 cents annually for that dividend. a big payout there, but certainly bigger if you are one of those employees participating in this uh Stock Program that Walmart offers its employees, which also includes a match from Walmart the company as well. the reason this is our stock to watch, though, what I want to point out to our audience is if you look at the Yahoo finance platform right now on YF plus, you can see that this stock is trading near the top of the 52 we range, but just at the bottom of the day range. so I'm curious to see what happens, heading into the market open, if some of those orders that folks put in to be able to get in on this stock once it's a little bit lower are going to up the stock price. we'll see coming up in about 15 minutes here. all right, Maddie, thanks so much. taking a look at shares of WMT going into the opening cross just about, as you mentioned, 14, 15 minutes away from right now. we'll check back in, Maddie.",[12]
118,834p9evBR48,"Broadcom earnings: There's more room for AI growth, analyst says",Yahoo Finance,2024-03-07 22:30:00+00:00,"broadcom. the company's first quarter results hitting the wire and the shares down a quick 1.8% here. let's run through the numbers here. first quarter adjusted earnings per share: beating estimates: $110.99. first quarter adjusted net revenue at $1.96 billion. it looks like semiconductor Solutions revenue is what the Miss is here. that came in at 7.39 billion. analysts were looking for $ 7.7 billion, so as far as I can tell, that's what's responsible here. I'm also seeing the company sees its full year Revenue at about $50 billion, so that's something we'll be watching as well. yeah, stocks down about 3 and a half% now. again, like marll julo broadcom, this was just another monster. it was up about 120% over the last TW 12 months. uh, some comments here, also from co Haw tan. he's talking about uh drivers of Revenue growth. he calls out VMware. of course they closed that big acquisition. uh, finally, late last year. also, remember part of the reason the stock has surged: investors seeing this as an AI play, and htan talks about that. they're networking products and AI data centers. talks about custom AI accelerators, from the hyperscalers to the big cloud Giants. again, though at least initially, here stock down the after hours, you know. and? and just one more thing I wanted to mention. as we talk about marll, as we talk about broadcom, there has been an enormous Surge and options activity around all the semiconductor makers. so when you see moves, also post earnings, you got to think that options plays are a part of that. let's talk more about these broadcom numbers. let's get to seef ra research senior Equity analyst, Angelo Zeno. so, Angelo, I know these numbers just came out, but just give us sort of your first blush take here. yeah, I mean listen, overall it it came kind of in line with expectations. I mean slightly ahead of expectations, um, if you really think about it for the, the January quarter. but as far as kind of the guidance that they provided, um, they they essentially last quarter interestingly kind of moved from a quarterly guidance to an annual guidance. and if you kind of look at what they provided here for the full fiscal year 2024, again it was pretty much matching what they said three months ago. if you kind of look at um, you guys pointed out some of the incredible moves we've seen in some of these kind of semiconductor, AI related names and both kind of broadcom, moreel, kind of running into the numbers this quarter. um, it's not necessarily a surprise that you kind of um aren't getting much of a reaction or kind of some downside here. um, on the names, uh, you know, given the kind of inline expectations out there- and Angelo, you know, interesting, of course you know part of the reason this stock has surged the way it did. investors see it as you know: another smart AI play and- and you've heard the company- they're obviously um getting much more bullish about the opportunities they see in AI. do you share that bullishness, Angelo? no, we do. I mean, and if you kind of look in calendar 2023, there were really two names out there on the semiconductor side of things that really did see some significant revenue on the AI side of things. that was, of course, Nvidia and the other name was broadcom and you saw kind of the, the reaction or the move in the stock prices last year from those names, as you kind of going into 2024 here, um, that that the same story that you saw in 23 for broadc comp continues to build here this year in terms of um really on the networking side of things being driven by two factors: one kind of their their ether switcher business out there, which is going to essentially nearly double this year, and then you kind of got that custom silicon business, which is largely uh alphabet if you think about it, and that's probably going to grow at least from a, you know, a three to four billion dollar type of run rate here this year. so there is a lot of growth attached to that AI story for broadcom. I think the other interesting thing of course is what's going on on the software side of things. if you look at the multiple for broadcom here over the last three, four months you've absolutely seen a reating here, differently than what you've seen, you know, from the reasoning from nvidia's move, which is really all kind of earnings beats um on that side of things. but broadcom it's more along the lines of now being a 6040 split um in terms of semis, um and software and kind of that visibility that you have over the next couple years and greater kind of acceleration on the software side of things is kind of, I think, attributing to the, the higher multiple for this name, and Angelo um hawana said that um, AI, the general spending in AI, could account for about a quarter of the company's Revenue this year. anything in these results that make you think that that number is too low or Too High? I mean we're not going to have color until they actually uh have their call and where they typically break down those numbers. but you kind of look at the guidance that they did provide again, I would think it's pretty much um everything's kind of running in line with what he previously commented on a couple of months ago. if you look at the Run rate just three months ago was uh AI was running at about 20% of their revenue. it was about 15% of their full fiscal year, uh 2023 Revenue. so that 25% number, I think um should, at the very least uh match expectations with potential upside to that number. and Angela, we'll get you out of here on this. you know this is broadcom's um first quarter. I I think, with uh, with VMware in tow here, they closed that acquisition uh late last year. Angelo, what, what is that acquisition going to mean for broadcom's business going forward? yeah, I think, I think it's a a great acquisition for them. you know, again, I think it it it boosts the, the margin trajectory of this company. I think a lot of investors are going to want to know um exactly where the, the Opex number, is going to look like here over the next couple of quarters. um, I think there was a hope that you know, maybe that you know the cost cutting was going to be maybe a little bit ahead expectations because Hawk has just been absolutely exceptional in Prior Acquisitions with the cost cutting moves. so we'll see what he have to he has to say on that side of things. but this is all about kind of driving that margin expansion, um The Cost Cuts which we expect will be about a 40% reduction from the end of last year to the end of this year. um, so there's going to be notable Cost Cuts and then, um again, it does accelerate the business in terms of um The Run rate, even kind of exiting the you know this calendar year as you go into next year. um, we do think single digit, low, double digit growth for the software business now um is what to be expected, where over the last couple years it's more, you know, has it's been more of a low, single digit grow driver for this company. all right stock initially here down the after hours we'll see what CEO htan has to say on the call. Angelo, thanks as always for joining us. appreciate it. great thanks for having.",[8]
119,WGksFVVuIxA,Berkshire Hathaway stock pulls back from record high on earnings,Yahoo Finance,2024-02-26 23:27:06+00:00,"birkshire hathway shares pulling back after hitting a record high early in the session, the company reporting a big profit gain in the fourth quarter, the highs of the day. that company was closing in on a $1 trillion market cap and join us now with CF vice president of equity research, Kathy cord. Kathy, it is. it is good to see you just looking at these results. so Brookshire's reporting post a record, Kathy: 37.4 billion in operating profit. interested to get your take, Kathy on the report. what' you make of it? I thought the numbers were decent. I mean, this is a large company and for all of 2023 they posted almost a 20% operating Revenue growth. um. Berkshire has a really good insurance franchise in Geico and a reinsurance franchise and as well as a commercial lines franchise and that really drove results. um, that plus higher investment income. I mean there, you know there are some some drags on on results um, and I think one of the reasons why the stock maybe a a little weak today is some concerns over Burk Shear's um utilities exposure and some of the Wildfire liability that their utilities um subsidiaries have. um, but all in all, I thought it was a really good quarter and a year. Kathy- it's Julie here- what do you make of Warren Buffett's sort of tempering expectations, which I guess is not that unusual for him to do, right, but, um, you know to say that for a firm of their size to continue to grow at this rate and also to continue to find Opportunities is just going to be difficult. does that something you think should dissuade investors? no, I mean, I think the letter um addressed a number of things that had been speculated: whether or not Berkshire was going to buy accidental petroleum, you know he addressed that and said definitively, they were not. um, the Japanese trading companies that they took an equity stake in. there was a question about whether or not they were going to acquire those, and I also think that Burkshire is trying to Tamp down expectations because they are so large. it's really difficult to move the needle when you're this big, which isn't to say that they're not going to deploy some of their 160 plus billion dollars in cash into Acquisitions. I just think he's trying to Tamp down expectations that he's going to make some Blockbuster deal. are you surprised, though, Kathy, that he is sitting on that kind of Mount of cash at this point? I mean $167 billion. do you think it's the right move? he? you know they haven't done a big deal. Kathy, correct me if I'm wrong in some time. I'm just I'm wondering if you're surprised they haven't put that to work well. you know, as an insurance company they do have to keep, you know, a fair amount of powder dry to pay claims. so it's not as though that entire, you know, cash Trove is is available for him to deploy into Acquisitions. um, I actually think the deal that they made a couple years ago to buy aligene strategically was a great move. it increased their presence in one of the few businesses where there's pricing power and there's secular growth, and that's the commercial insurance space. um, it also got them, Joe Brandon, back into the fold, which is an important consideration because I do think succession is going to be an issue. but back to your question about cash. um, I think that they will gradually, you know, make some deals again. Market valuations are not that attractive, um, which, you know, to my mind, um makes me think they may look at private companies, but they also have a lot of competition from private Equity Venture Capital. so I do think that there is a level of frustration at birkshire. um, you know, about deploying that Capital. there's also the option to buy back shares. the shares have been on a tear this year so that you know even their own shares may not be as attractive to them on a buyback perspective. um, do you think that frustration is shared by shareholders as well, or do you think that most the folks who hold Berkshire are sort of content to just write it out and be patient? I think Berkshire has a fairly satisfied investor based um. you know, I do sort of wonder in a post Buffett environment if there is a push to initiate a dividend. they're one of the few sort of non-te um. you know they're not a rapidly growing firm. they CL. you know they're a value stock, yet they don't pay a dividend. I could see a situation where, you know, sometime in the future perhaps their investor base pushes them to initiate a dividend. but my sense is that the majority of birkshire Hathaway's shareholder base is a pretty satisfied bunch. and, Kathy, I'll get you here out of here on this kind of looking ahead. it was interested. Buffett said: listen, he, he thinks um, his successor is ready to take the Baton. said Greg AEL, you know, ready to be CEO tomorrow. I think is is how Buffett put it. is that how you see it, Kathy? yeah, I mean, I think I. I think, as we head into the annual meeting, I think front and Setter um in investors Minds is the succession. the succession issue in buffit is 93 um. I do think that they could do a better job of highlighting the strength of the management bench a couple of um levels below the SE Suite, because there is a pretty strong team there guiding a number of the different operating subsidiaries, yet shareholders rarely get the opportunity to really hear from these people. um, I think in the letter he made a very interesting point when he said: you know, join us in Omaha and Ai and Greg and I will be on the day answering your questions. so I I do think there's a concerted effort as well there should be to sort of, you know, calm investor concerns about the succession issue at the company. Kathy, thank you so much, really appreciate it, my pleasure.",[6]

Costco shares. they are falling pre-market after missing analyst expectations for Revenue in its second fiscal quarter. the big box retailer did, however, beat estimates in its same store sales, Rising 5.8% compared to the 5% that was expected. joining us now for more on this result, more on these results. we've got Noah Roar who is the Morning Star Equity analyst here. I mean no, if we kind of draw a through line between what we were just talking about with the employment situation and Costco's earnings, I mean retail, that was ultimately little changed over this last month. however, uh, you did see general merchandise retailers really account for the majority of those gains in that particular sector here. as for Costco and how they talked about employment and the broader state of their business on the call, want to know what jumps out most notably to you. yeah, we think it was a really strong, really strong quarter again for Costco, with comparable store sales in the US, including Fel, up 4.8%, up 9%. Canada, 88.2% internationally. so, broadly, they just continue to attract consumers to their, to their warehouses and I think what's really, um, really encouraging is really the composition of that comparable store sales growth. right, they continue to drive four or five% traffic to their stores so as they continue to lever um, continue to grow their volumes in their warehouses, they can continue to lover their fixed costs and just sort of reinforce this flywheel and just strengthen their competitive Advantage, their cost advantage, over time. so we think it was a really strong quarter. again, you still have a market perform rating on the stock. this is a stock that's up about 55% over the past year. what's fair value to you when it comes to Costco? yeah, so our Fair Value Estimate on Costco right now is 480 per share, which our Our Fair Value Estimate implies about a 30 times price to earnings multiple um. really not necessarily an indictment on on the company. we think the growth outlook for for Costco is still very strong and, as I mentioned, we think that this quarter just sort of reinforced it, its wide mod rating that we award the company. but the valuation to us does seem a bit stretched. to what extent is Costco an indicator from your perspective of of the broader economy right now, especially as we think about the consumer? yeah, I think. I think Costco's consumers are Costco's Court consumer tends to probably hold up a little bit better than than the average consumer and and I think as maybe as as, uh, consumers start to feel a little bit more tightness, um, in terms of the broader economy, we could see volume continuing to increase at Costco. so potentially, um, we could see Costco kind of benefiting from from a tighter macro environment or a little bit slower consumer spending and and we've heard that with with Walmart and Target too, they've mentioned that consumers are more value conscious and we think, as people kind of keep going to Costco, that that sort of reinforces that view. no, when it comes to the positioning of Costco, really what it tells us more broadly speaking, about the consumer narrative right now, we heard from President Biden last night and state the Union Address. he's talking about the fact that consumers have been resilient, they still remain extremely confident. from the retailers that you cover specifically within the consumer staple space, What are some of the trends that you're seeing and what is that indicative to you just in terms of the strength of the consumer at this point? yeah, I think, broadly speaking, the consumer is still pretty strong, right, and and and that showed up in in the retail sales. I know it was a little bit softer last month than expected, but, generally speaking, um across our coverage. management teams and companies seem to say that consumers are a bit more stretched than they have been over the past few years, but they're still spending. they still have money in their pockets and they are seeking out value a little bit more, but generally they continue to spend. so so overall, I think the consumer is still doing okay at the moment. as of right now, I mean, we're watching shares pre-market lower by about 3% Costco over the past year to date, or even over the past year, if you look back that far up, 60%- at what point do you believe that it's time for some of the investors out there to consider taking profits? or is there a next leg higher that they should remain locked in for? yeah, again, kind of going back to our Fair Value Estimate, we we do have it at 480 per share, so we do think that the valuation has gotten stretched. obviously, Costco is- I don't want to say Recession Proof, but maybe a bit more recession resistant- resistant, so to speak. um, just given their low price value proposition and that resonates with consumers. so we could, I think we'll still continue to see the business performing well, um, but we do think that the valuation is stretched at the moment.",[23]

I know the team over there is not, uh, really enthusiastic about down sales, the key for Target stock to work and what the market is pricing in this morning is returned to growth. now I also caught up with Target chairman Co Brian Cornell. he says: Brian, we are going back to growth mode this year. I put that question to fideli and he said: guys, it might take into the middle of this year for sales to Pivot. of course Target will be comping. uh, lower sales: we're just going up bit easier against against easier sales comparisons versus last year when sales were declined. so just by extension of that, maybe a little better consumer mindset sales should start to be growing into the holiday shopping scene. so that's good. all that said, uh, I'm over earnings already. I think the big story is what this company presents at their New York City investor day later today. I would be on the lookout for, uh, them opening up a large number of new super center stores. Cornell and fideli didn't want to front run me, uh, or front run their news by telling me how many stores they plan to open up. but an early theme from retailer earnings: uh, these companies are back to opening stores. uh, but also this Amazon Prime killer. now I I wouldn't say it's going to be a killer and I would actually be concerned on how Target could stay competitive at this environment. looking across the landscape Shauna. we talked to uh Walmart CFO, John David, rating on the day where they made a big deal for Vio. uh, Walmart plus is a program that is out there. it has got off to a very good start. Walmart has content, has a tie up with Paramount plus, has the same day delivery and now is about to have Vio. you look at Costco. you pay for membership each month. you get amazingly low prices and, of course, Amazon Prime- amazing delivery service, content, ass assortments, uh, other things you get under Amazon Prime discounts at Whole Foods, which is a favorite for me. so I think target really has to come out here at this investor day later today, because there's a lot of enthusiasm on this plan. uh, maybe Target charges $100 a year, whatever it is. they have to deliver more than just getting people to pay up for some form of membership to get products do your door quicker. yeah, I'm curious, as because you, we have all talked about this in the past- just why hasn't Target come out with a product like this earlier? right, there's been lots of talk about the fact that this could really be a driver here in sales in the long run. I'm curious, though- and I know a lot of this is just just speculation at this point, but from the analyst notes that you, I know you have read very thoroughly over the last several quarters, and now that we actually have this announcement right, what is expected to be included and, I guess, how big will it really move the needle when it comes to sales in the? well, I'm glad you asked that, because I used to be an analyst covering retail stock, so let me get into my head. on a day like this, I'm thinking Costco raking in millions of dollars on membership fee income. Target's going to do the same. earning is going to blow out of the water for the next 20 years. Whatever It Is Well, slow your roll. that doesn't necessarily how this works. there's a lot of competition for memberships, and if you have an Amazon Prime membership, do you want to pay for a Target and do you want to give up your Costco membership to pay for a Target membership? I think very important for Target to have true success here to deliver a, a scaled up membership program where they're charging people real money each year- $100, $50, whatever it is. they have to do more than just offer great same to delivery services. do I get a free Starbucks Coffee. what is the rewards, the overall value equation, look like for a program like this? because if they don't, it's going to fall flat on its face. all right, you heard it here first, but S I do agree with you, they it has to be those incentives. you have to make a reason in order to subscribe to Target, because so many people are already- and I'm one of those people- I love my Amazon Prime. it's going to be hard to give it up. if this program offers me free energy drinks at Target, I'm down. I'm signing up today. today, I'm signing up for all the celsi is you could drink sazy.",[107]

I said so: we, we as a nation, are going to have to come up with all sources of energy we can, and so, as a go, this is a colon, thermal, metalogical uh producer. they're going to. this is not going away, right, as much as they're saying. you know, it's coal, it's fossil fuels, all stuff. it is not going away because we need the energy. well, it's not going away, except there is the transition, right, so let's. so that would be the risk to your bull case here is that we definitely have seen an attempted policy pivot away from coal. right, but you may have a policy pivot, but if you, but if the alternative energy is not going to produce enough energy, then we're going to go right back to what does produce energy. right, but that is a risk. so if there's more regulation, or if they force it out, or if you get the more climate change pressures, then you could see this story back off a little bit gotcha. all right. so let's get to your stock that you don't like. this one is big old oil, gas, a great. you know Blue Chip name. I get it. it's not so much I don't like it, but when we're talking about where the opportunity is, I think that's that's really what we're talking about. all right, let's run through it. then you're talking about 10% profit margin for this company. so this has a 10% profit margin versus cix. you know, they have a. they have a a 25% profit margin. Chevron has a um, um, 13% return on Equity. cix has a 50% return on Equity. so there's, you know, just mathematically those numbers are different, right, and so if you're talking about a trade, one to buy and one maybe to void. that's why this seems apparent to me, right, yeah, and another way to sort of um value it here is EIT out a market cap right to market cap. so there, the seven times, cix is the two times, and even if they cix buys back, they continue to buy back their stock. it's still going to be cheaper on a relative basis than Chevron. so I think that's the opportunity. yeah, I mean, chevron's also trying to make a monster acquisition, so we could see, you could change, but you. but the risk to this, once again, is regulation. right, if my numbers of my analysis is wrong, or there's a push for Renewables, but look, Chevron has a big presence in Renewables, so it actually could end up being good for Chevron. that that would be the risk of why I'm wrong. gotcha, if they are diversifying the revenue streams and bring in more money, which they are on the AL, on the, you know alternative platforms, but, uh, I think you know from a, from a, from an investment trading perspective, that shortterm theory that I come up with I think works. and do you like energy, sort of RIT large? do you think it's a good area to? I like energy, particularly like energy going into 2024 and 2025. and look if there's a change of leadership at the top- uh, a republican Administration, I think Energy's, I think energy is really in play if there's a republican Administration. okay. so let's summarize what you're telling people here with this particular play Here by Console Energy, based on those strong financials and future Demand. on the other side, you say: avoid Chevron, the return on investment is too low, as are the profit margins, correct? um, one other thing that I wanted to discuss while you're here: you are well known not just for putting out a daily Market note, but you always include a recipe in that note. I because food and finance, it kind of works, right, because Finance can be so unnerving for people but yet food can be so nourishing, right, and I like to cook and I like to. I don't cook fancy, I cook Homestyle. and so today I gave you zucchini surprise, zuc surprise. what is the zucchini surprise? which is you got to go buy the zucchinis, you trim the edges, you slice them on a mandolin so they're long. yes, right, you need olive oil, you need breadcrumbs, fresh Gra pan cheese, salt and pepper. so then you slice the zucchini, you dip them in the oil, then you dip them in the breadcrumbs that you've mixed with the cheese and the salt and pepper. then you put a a slice of either pruto or ham, provalone cheese or swiss cheese, whatever really you want, roll them and then just put them in a baking dish. right, don't do anything else. put them in a baking dish, put them in your oven for 350 degre for about 25 or 30 minutes. take them out. they're all nice and brown and melty inside. they're delicious, perfect and it's easy. you can have it as dinner, can have as an appetizer. that's my goodbye today. I think is the zucchini surprise.",[25]
126,bTFbkGn5ugA,Tesla stock falls over China concerns including BYD and other homegrown EV competition,Yahoo Finance,2024-03-05 18:38:47+00:00,"all right well. Tesla shares tumbling to new multi-week lows on troubles in China now slowing China shipments and new price Cuts in the region, spelling some caution for the year ahead. for more on this, we want to bring in Dan lovey. he is Barkley's senior Autos analyst. Dan, it's great to see you again. so we've seen the reaction obviously play out in shares over the last two days: concerns about what we're seeing demand wise in China, some of this a bit overdone, or what do you think? yeah, thank thank you, uh, Sean Brad, for for having me look. I. I think what we're seeing playing out is the, the broader theme that we've been talking about uh into the year, which is that this is really a year about pivoting from Supply constraints to demand constraints, and you're seeing that playing out in the EB Market, where you know and and, and this is something we've been seeing in the in the back half of last year, especially where you're seeing some questions on demand. what's the? what's the sustainable pace of volume? um, look the. the February data for for Tesla in China was probably impacted by Chinese New Year. so you know we don't want to look uh, we don't want to focus too much into that, but we are below consensus on on first quarter uh deliveries. um, you know, roughly 450,000 units and uh you know, look in in addition to you know the Dynamics around Chinese New Year. you have some slowdown in Fremont related to the refresh of of model 3. uh you have uh some issues with Berlin production around Red Sea delays and just broadly know they're sitting on a lot of uh inventory and so this, I think, underpins our more uh conservative view versus consensus deliveries in 2024. we're at roughly 2 million. consensus is 2.1 million. just think that you know there's going to be some challenges on meeting some of the consensus numbers. Dan, we we had continued to monitor, at least for I want to say a couple years now, a shift in sentiment from some of the consumers within the region towards other homegrown Brands, and perhaps ybd has been able to see their own uh successes within the region Skyrocket and move past Tesla. even how much of it is tied back to that mindset as well. listen, I think this is a a key theme in the Auto industry. it's it's the rise of of byd and some of the other domestic Chinese that have really figured out the cost. Dynamics. Tesla has actually fared okay in China. you know they've generally maintained uh in in the BB Market. call it high singled digigit, low double digigit market share, which is very respectable, um, it does. it is obviously below where byd is, where they've been pacing lately at roughly a quarter of the market. so I think there is still room for Tesla to to grow volumes, even with byd doing well. um, but it is a reminder that you know of the regions where Tesla's competing. you know, uh, you're up us China. China is by far going to be the most competitive and the most intense. we've seen some price Cuts lately and that's where it's. you know it's a bit trickier for for Tesla versus other regions, Dan, and we've still not seen the worst for Tesla when it comes to the pricing Wars and the pressure that that will likely put on stock. well, uh, there's probably more price Cuts coming. this is what we're including in in our model. um. our view is that, you know, probably continues for at least the first half of of the year. we actually have pricing flattening out in the back half of the year. I would say one thing that you've seen change a little bit with Tesla is that, as opposed to last year, where there were sort of more uh open and wide price cuts from them. uh. what we've seen really in in the last- call it six months is more. I would call it discreet- uh discounting, other forms of discounting. I think in the US you know some of the large price cuts that they did last year uh were maybe not as stimulative of demand. this is why you know they're constantly facing this question of uh elasticity of demand, because the price Cuts really hadn't driven the type of volume that they may be hoped for. and I think where you're maybe seeing a little bit of a pivot is holding the line a little more on on pricing, rather than the approach last year, which was all we care about is volume. remember the comment from Milan a year ago that we could theoretically sell cars at no profit, and that view has changed that. you know they're clearly being a little more sensitive around the margin line. Dan, thanks so much for taking the time here today breaking down some of the key themes that investors are tracking around: Tesla and the broader eeve landscape. Dan Levy, who is the barlay senior Autos analyst, appreciate the time. great. thank you so much, Brad and Shauna.",[11]

Brian, yeah, this re, uh, this quarter really hit the, uh the bullseye. uh, make that gong sound or blow out the football will. so, nonetheless, a top one of the top three tickers on the, a finance platform today up d double digits. not the normal session for a Discounter like Target. but really what Target did here hit a lot of really important notes. first, last year, they revealed that they cut 5 $ million in cost out of their business- really boosted profit margins in a year that sales were absolutely in the tank. why people didn't shop the toy or bought a big screen TV nonetheless. Target said that. and then, on top of that, they hold a held a closely watched New York City invest day, said they're going to launch a membership program. uh, that takes aim at Amazon Prime and Walmart. plus $49 a year, I believe, gets you a same day. free delivery gets lots of analysts on Wall Street, I'm sure, excited. they're going to generate millions of dollars in Costco like membership fee income. I caution people to just think before you start modeling that in, because it doesn't happen overnight. and then, lastly, Target also came out and said they will be opening hundreds of stores throughout the next decade- about 30 this year, 30 next year- and they will continue at this pace. that is a number- a lot of folks in the street, I don't think, baked in for Target, because they haven't been opening up stores at that pace over the past few years and they're going to be bigger stores, as I understand it too. I mean, this reminds me of like what was it seven, eight, seven, eight years ago where Target did their last? like we're making the stores more beautiful, we're remerchandising, we refreshing, but like it's just interesting. it feels a little bit like, you know, we're Back to the Future here when it comes to Target. in that sense, yeah, let me toss up my takeaways, because I think there's some broader themes you brought up here, Julie. one within retail, and we'll get some more retail earnings this week: Nordstrom, some Discounters, whatever it is you'll find in our platform, but a lot of Cost Cuts. a lot of retailers cut a ton of cost last year from their operating model and now that is starting to. we weave through through, uh their financial statements and really boost margin check done, that's good. inventory levels for Target: down 12% year-over aear inventory levels throughout. a lot of retailers are reported like Walmart down lows, inventory Down. Home Depot inventory down. that helps keep cost low. and what you mentioned, store openings, is not just a Target thing. Home Depot of all places, Opening 12 hulking super centers this year to sell lumber and plywood to various people. I know I believe you have the TX SE of TX coming. saw him in the green room. I think that is a very good thing for that company as well. Home Depot opening up more St to sell uh flooring. Lowe's opening up stores. Walmart opening and remodeling hundreds of stores. these retailers, even if the consumer Under Pressure, are finding new ways to unlock growth and shareholders are simply eating all this stuff up. let me ask you this, Brian sazy: as you sift through these earnings reports, you listen to these calls, you talk to these Executives. you're a viewer right now and you're you're a retail investor. where do you want to commit Capital? where do you want to play? do you want to play low income consumer, High income consumer? I'm going to try to confuse everybody. uh, I think you want to try to play the High income consumer and look through the prism of where are they shopping? they are in fact shopping at Walmart. I will just add, before I get flagged by various people: I'm not telling you to go out, even buy Walmart shares. I'm telling you what I heard from Walmart's earnings call just about two weeks ago. they are telling you right off the bat: a higher income household is going to Walmart. they no longer View Walmart as a dumpy place to buy HomeGoods. they no longer View Walmart as a not a good alternative compared to a Crower and they want to give them more of their money. and I think that's how you do it. that's why one more chairs have outperformed the past year and they're just really operating very well right now under Co duck. I hope I didn't confuse anybody. no, strong tap, strong passion, remember. I didn't tell you to go out and buy Walmart, so don't flag me on X saying I told you to buy Walmart. this just analysis, real time. where do you shop, Ryan SII? uh, I actually. uh, I go to Target. I'm still a Target guy. I like finding my wait, are we? it's t? I really want to try very hard to always disagree with you, because it's just natural and it just makes for better segments. but I have to agree with you: target, it's just a fun place to shop. they have my beyond meat meatballs. they have maybe a t-shirt that I need for n n box- $9 and I'm okay with all that. I I'll give Target more of my money. they also, I got to say, the kids clothing. I still go there sometimes for the kids clothing. wait, can I ask you a question? I going to ask you a question: are you signing off for the new Target membership program? do you need that in your life? no, okay, and I think that's very telling and I think that answer right there. if you're an analyst, you're modeling millions of dollarars, Julie. that is the average American Shopper right there. listen to Julie hman. she's not signing up forie hman in spreadsheets all over W. I know that I'm the typical American shoer, but I appreciate your vote of confidence in modeling to be here. thank you, thank you, thanks so much, appreciate it.","[12, 107]"

Yahoo finances travel guide 2024- industry insights puts you at the center of the story, looking at Planes, Trains, Automobiles and any other form of Transport you can think [Music] of. we're diving deep into the travel sector as a part of Yahoo finances travel guide 2024: industry insights. now for investors, looking to the best way to play the travel sector, I've got three stocks for you to watch as we gear up for those Peak Travel Seasons. first, let's talk a little Airlines. let's go to the skies with the steel Birds. it's got to be Delta here. Delta is really focused here on International and that's one the themes that could really play out here and benefit them. you think back to why city has this as one of their 2024 stock picks for the year here. well, it comes back to that international travel demand here. and from Ed Bastion, the CEO of Delta, what he's told us in the most recent earnings is what we see in our whole bookings is really more of the same that we've been seeing all year: International bookings and demand looks really strong. that's what he told Yahoo finance after they reported their most recent quarterly earnings. he also went on to say so I think we're looking at a very, very strong Q3, as indicated by their guidance, and we'll have a strong Q4 as well, and so that is one of the kind of broader Lookouts into deep in this year where international travel could play a role. now let's also talk about Marriott. let's go to the accommodation space. this one's going to be in focus, and why? well, it's one of the top picks among analysts who are looking across the accommodations in the hotel industry across the street here, and it has outperformed many of its industry competitors here. but one huge theme to zero in on for Marriott is going to be that rebound in corporate travel that we've been continuing to talk about, with the number of events that are set to be hosted and bookings that come along with those events. Marriott, seen, is one of the outstanding uh participants or performers within that market here, especially as compared to some of its other peers here as well, even though one of the others also having a good year to date. that's high it so keep close tabs on them. they're up by about 15%. and, lastly, let's go to the high seas here, if you will, where you'll find perhaps Captain Jack Sparrow and a few of his other friends. let's go to the Caribbean, Caribbean, whatever you're calling it, Royal Caribbean, ticker symbol, RCL, that is really have having a focus on these new fleets and that could potentially pull forward some bookings here. and so, if you think back to the earnings call that this company just had, they expect to grow capacity by the introduction of the Utopia of the Seas and silver Ray in the First full year of service of the three incredible ships that joined their Fleet during 2023: the icon of the sea, celebrity ascent and silver NOA. the new ships not only Elevate their vacation experiences, they said, and draw new customers to their brands. but they also provide yield Tailwinds, they said on the call, enhancing overall profitability, and in 2024 they expect yields to grow 5 and A4 to 7 and a qu% driven by the performance of their entire fleet. so that is all that we're going to be tracking, at least in these three stocks here, and we'll see how those themes play out for Marriott, Delta and Royal Caribbean.","[122, 238]"

Microsoft's up about 8%, so a little bit over the market. so maybe we'll call it three and a half. but to me, the prevailing takeaway that we've seen in earnings projections movements is: maybe we're not talking about the Magnificent 7, maybe it's the Fantastic 4 or the three and a half, I don't know, but it it seems like we're no longer in this seven Tech stock phase and it's certainly narrow. the triple threat, yeah, Triple Threat, that was a good one. okay, I was trying to. I was sitting over here trying to come up with something quick. you beat me to it. but J, I think also for investors, right is what this means for the broader market, right, zooming out even more, talking about how this is factoring into S&P projections for year. we've seen a number of analysts- even this week, with Barkley's out this morning- upping their target even more and and most of these strategist that are coming out and saying they expect the S&P 500 to rise higher. so barklay is coming out and saying that they think it's going to go to 5,300. they're boosting their target from 4,800. the main driver of that is big Tech. so they're saying they think the economy is going to hold up well, which is, of course, important because big Tech also needs the economy to do well. right, but then they're also highlighting that they think that big Tech is going to be the big outperformer here. and they said in the in this release here: uh, in their research they were highlighting overall how much more big Tech is worth in the earning story than the rest of the S&P 500 and really the rest of big Tech if you were to remove big Tech. I'm looking at their projections for the full year 20124. right now you're talking about the rest of the S&P 500 being at like $177 worth of earnings. instead of what? when you add in big Tech, you get $46 more uh worth of earnings in that. so it's a significant increase. when you're adding in big Tech and adding in those high expectations, that's what's driving these targets higher. right now seems like nothing stopping. what is it? Triple Threat, the trifecta, the hatrick one day. we got to just do two hours on just the triple threat. we'll just talk about the three stocks: triple, double, it's all that. it's you know who needs the 497? nobody.","[4, 5]"

Robert, it's good to have you here. so certainly it looks like shareholders, investors, are pleased with these results. what's your first take on Paramount's most recent earnings report? yeah, good morning. um, we think it was a kind of inline quarter. um, I think it speaks to what what you just touched on. clearly they're they're very much focused as one of their key priorities this year in terms of uh, reducing the losses and trying to hit profitability. they gave guidance for 25 to hit us um, streaming profitability, um, and really they're doing as well as they can. but there are still significant challenges out there in the industry that that they have to face. what is the likelihood that they can navigate those challenges without uh, an acquisition or a merger? I mean that is the key question here. um, clearly, there's been lots of speculation over the past few months in terms of those potential Partnerships and and uh, different exit strategies for the company, um, with public and and probably more private bids too. um, ultimately it comes down to the appetite that any acquirer wants to take on um the the risk that that comes with that because of the secular challenges facing the traditional TV ecosystem, with advertising headwinds and cord cutting, everything that that we're all familiar with. but really the question is: what is the value of of these assets and what's the value to different parties involved? Robert, anything in this report? does it change at all the position of Paramount, given the fact that it is obviously at a disadvantage when you compare it to some of the leaders within the space? yeah, I'd say that the biggest disadvantage um is really that: the lack of cash that the company produces. um, they did surprise if, if you want to call it um a little bit to the upside in terms of expectations, with free cash flow growing slightly um over, uh, the positive cash flow that they got to in 23. so you know that that is, I guess, a step in the right direction. but just relative to to most of these other media companies out there, there's just really not a lot of cash, free cash flow that the company's producing, which again puts it in a challenging position, given that the debt and The Leverage here. I mean this really seems like a company that is trying to get that direct to Consumer profitability, cost synergies here. but that has been achieved by some other competitors by also announcing ing some of the advertising tiers and we're seeing that that digital advertising landscape really kind of heat up here. what does that flow through mean for for paramounts, and can they attract the same type of advertising spend that some of those other major competitors are doing? yeah, it's a great question. um, I would say they're still ramping up there and, um, you know, are talking about the fact that that there are opportunities there. um, they also have the other asset, Pluto, which is one of the fast channels, and it seems as if growth has has slowed there, cooled off at the very least. um, so they're, they're definitely pushing more on the Paramount plus advertising tier but, as I'm sure you all know, um, so are everyone else, and especially with Amazon now in the marketplace and Netflix ramping up and Disney plus ramping up, there's just a lot of competition for these streaming ad dollars. yeah, we do know it well.

Amazon set to join the index in replacing Walgreens boots Alliance. but it may not all be good news. Jared blicker is here with a look at how historical changes to the Dow has affected the average. Jared Josh, we've been here before and I just want to dial back the the clock to 2020. it was August, so it was the first year of the pandemic and it was a few months before the presidential election and Exxon booted from the Dow in replacing it with Salesforce in. there were two other changes as well. I'll get to in a second, but I just want to show you what has happened in the 873 days trading days since then. you can see Salesforce up a whopping 2.63% and Exxon up over 160%. so these changes- uh, it's usually not this dramatic, but a lot of these changes can have implications for the overall market. Dow is the people's index. it might only be 30 stocks, but it goes back to the late 1800s, 1896, and it is a reference point in the market. and guess what? Dow has not hit 40,000 yet, but actually very recently. had the swap not been made, exon4 CRM there would have hit very recently itself 40,000. now there are two other changes. as I mentioned, fizer was booted for amen and with his, with hindsight here, that was actually the correct decision given this time frame, although it was not necessarily looking that great in 2021. and then Honeywell was swapped out for RTX, which is Ron techn ology. uh, rathon up about 50% here. honey well up 20% and, by the way, honey well, this is its at least second time in the Dow. so sometimes you see a little bit of uh circulation here, but the bottom line is, just because a company has kicked out of the Dow, that might actually be a little bit of a bell weather, might be a little bit of a Tailwind for it, just because, after a big decision like this, you know it's been a long time in the making. the official reason and the official trip here was, uh, actually Walmart splitting at stock. you might say, well, how does that change things? well, because of the way, very old way- that the Dow is calculated, a stock split can precipitate other changes in the index and it gives the opportunity to reconstruct it, and in fact, that's what led to that original change in 20120 where we had these three changes. it was Apple. Apple did a stock split and because of that, uh, Dow S&P. they wanted more exposure for Tech in the fund and they put in Salesforce, with the result that we would have had higher performance had that not happened. we'll have to see if something similar happens with Amazon and wal Walgreens, uh, but we'll have to see in a few years.","[4, 207, 215]"

I mean, we should know. listen, this Stock's already enjoyed a huge run. it's already up about 80% over the past 12 months. but there is a new Bull on on the street and stea likes this one target goes to 210. and, yeah, they certainly it was interesting. you don't usually hear an calling it out like that, but he does take issue um with his colleagues on the street, thinks their estimates for 2025, uh, are just missing the Target. in their opinion, when they run the spreadsheet, they come up with something a lot different. um, vast majority of analysts do like Micron. this isn't sort of at a Sync here. I mean more than 80% still think you should buy this one. yeah, another good line in the report here is that the stock could be aided by what they call the most compelling growth to valuation ratio amongst larger cap AI relevant stocks. on the flip side today, I do quickly want to mention muho. the analysts over there saying they're concerned about you know, most of people we've talked of said we don't think it's a bubble. over at mizuho they said they are getting concerned that the rally is getting a little toppy. well, we talk all the time.

Dubai carrier Emirates now voicing its support of Boeing's potential takeover of spirit Aeros systems. here with more on what's ahead for Boeing, we've got steel analyst Bert subin- Bert, great to have you here with us this morning. first and foremost, the likelihood that we see finalization of a Boeing Spirit deal. uh, well, first, thanks for having me back. um, on the program, uh, I, I think it's reasonably likely. um, I think there's been some questions about whether the dog FTC would doj or FTC would would hold it up, and you know we couldn't find any examples of vertical integration really being sort of, you know, a Target for the doj. I mean, I think if you look at sort of what they've gone after, it's been more anti-competitive. this would be essentially the reabsorption of a supplier by Boeing. um, you would get likely, at the same time, a divestiture of of the Airbus assets and so, as far as being allowed, I think it would. it would, it would ultimately pass through antitrust scrutiny. um, in terms of whether Boeing would do it, I think they've sort of- you know, you know, found this to be the the path forward that makes the most sense. um, just because it's become increasingly difficult to, you know, oversee its supply chain- and uh, spirit is a huge part of that- where they've had some quality escapes over the last you know couple years, um, and so I think this is, you know, an actionable um, you know sort of right move for Boeing, uh, to sort of get control over things, to get the fa more comfortable with this production and to get its customers- you mentioned Tim Clark and Emirates, um, you know, more comfortable with the direction they're going in. so I do ultimately think you know you have a greater than 50% chance of of Boeing and spirit ultimately merging, you know, later this year. B, do you see this being a catalyst for the stock in the long run? I think it's it's sort of the first Domino on the path to normalization, right? so when the January 5th accident that happened at Alaska, the question was, you know, reputationally, what's this going to mean? you know you going to see a lot of order cancellations. we haven't seen that yet, and I think part of that is: you know where do you go. Airbus has sold out for the next decade, and so it's proven difficult to get slots there. um, then there was a question of what happens to production. um, right now they're frozen at 38 per month on the Max, and it could certainly be worse than that, and so it's maybe be a few months until they get to the next leg. but if they reacquire Spirit, if they get greater control over the supply chain, then I think they'll get the blessing by the fa over time to to, to get those numbers back up. um, and so you know, ultimately, I think, is this a catalyst? it's sort of hard to say. you know, as soon as this deal, should it happen, we're closed, the Stock's going to pop. I don't for see that, but I think you'll see a sort of a gradual Improvement. um, because really the number one thing we've been looking at at Boeing is there's this risk premium that's built into the stock. um, you know, people are essentially embedding in the fact that they don't know what could happen next. you know, could there be another incident? could there be something on the quality side. how do you price that in? so I think this would sort of help, you know, lower that risk premium as we go down to live and so looking for an offset in that risk premium, when we think about any type of acquisition that usually takes place, there's some type of Premium that's tacked on. at what point is Boeing paying too much for spirit? it's an interesting question. I mean, our view has been, you know, the typical buyout premiums, about 30%. um. the stock was trading call at 2850 before we saw the Wall Street Journal Wall Street Journal article on this U start to circulate and so they're trading a little north of 20% premium on that right now, and so I don't think there's a ton of upside to where we are currently for Spirit. um, now, would they overpay? I mean, you look at Boeing, it's $60 billion. do Enterprise Value versus spirit? it's around seven and a half, and so this is still a very small deal for someone like like Boeing. and so if they were to overpay by a little bit, does that super meaningful? maybe a little less so, but um, I think that when you start factoring in the fact that that Spirit owes supplier advances to Boeing of about 220 million. um, they would have to carve off the Airbus assets. you know, I think the ultimate price they pay will will be sort of in the ballpark we're at now, if not a touch lower. so I'm not anticipating you're going to see this massive premium paid for Spirit, should a deal go through.",[78]
137,6f5qumfvc9Q,AI rally picks up steam with Dell and AMD,Yahoo Finance,2024-03-01 17:27:49+00:00,"AI trade picking up some steam. this morning we're tracking two trending tickers on our site: AMD and Dell, both climbing pre-market around AI hype. yaho finances Jared blicker. he's over at the big board tracking the market action. Jared, let's start with Dell. what are you seeing there? I'm seeing a huge move in the pre-market trading to the upside, up 30%. now this is going to be good for a fresh record. uh, the opening print could be around $120. that's $122 48 that you're looking at right there, and this is a stock that has been on fire of 23% year to date. that doesn't include the 30% in the pre-market and over the last year. uh, we can see gains there of about 132%. now. uh, there is a tie-in to Ai and this has to do with the chips that are powering it and AMD is getting a ride off of it. this morning as well, the stock was up, uh, about 9% yesterday and it was up 3%. it's up 3% now in the after hours trading. and here's the tie in. and here's this comes from a research note, uh, from melus research. traditional server CPUs picking up help help support AMD margins and it lends further upside to its data center segment. also, we believe Dell received meaningful orders. orders for the AMD made Mi 300X. that's a new chip that will start shipping this quarter and pick up throughout the year. now there have been concerns that AMD is really lagging in Vidia in terms of AI technology. this doesn't necessarily resolve that one way or the other, but it does put AMD into the Forefront of uh investors Minds. these are the year-to-date percentages in the background, along with the pre-market quotes. So AMD up 30%, another 3% in the pre-market, but that doesn't really compare to Nvidia, which is up 60% and, by the way, going to attack on another 1.2%. probably good for another record on the open guys.",[24]
138,nyFM1URefro,"HP CEO on Q1 revenue decline: We expect the PC market to grow, demand has slowed down",Yahoo Finance,2024-02-28 22:20:35+00:00,"let's also take a look at shares of HP Inc. that company's Revenue missing estimates here. $3.19 billion was the first quarter net revenue number. $ 13.58 billion is what analysts had been anticipating and the company's second quarter forecast of adjusted earnings per share of 76 to 86 cents is uh Compares with the 82 cents that analysts had been forecasting here. but it seems like that sales Miss is to blame for the drop in the stock. in addition to that, first quter free cash flow at only $25 million versus the billion dollars that analysts have been anticipating. that's a bit of a heads scratchers. so we'll uh dig into that a little bit further. but effectively what you have here is that PC sales are still relatively weak here. so that Revenue figure is down 4.4%. yeah, it'll be just be very interesting to see what the company says about the PC market now and, looking ahead, what's the demand environment like? what's pricing going to look like? there are some folks who've been betting on a PC recovery. yeah, um, and remember of got talk printing in and toner- I know not the most rting topic, Julie butal for thisan. so also what the company sees there, print, consumer, Print, commercial- will be very important. it looks like printing was kind of in line with estimates. it's where the actual PC sales came in. that disappointed yep for more on this. Yahoo fin, his very own, Brian sazy, did catch up with hp's CEO, Enrique Loris to go over the numbers. Enrique, earnings came in fairly well and I think that says a lot about how your team continues to to manage costs. but talk to us about why sales in the in the Computing business and the printer business why have? why did they decline the quarter? I think I would say we had a solid quarter in in q1 and both the decline on revenu was really driven by what we see from a market perspective. but internally we are executing well. we grew share inpcs, which you know is the major driver of Revenue. so from from execution perspective, we do well. I think what is also important to highlight is that we continue to expect the PC market to grow in 2024. we expect the second half of the year to be stronger and we are well positioned to write that growth when it will come. what is it about those market dynamics, Enrique, that you that you just mentioned, that is putting pressure on volumes of PS and printers? well, what we have seen is that demand has lowed down. I think it's driven by the cautiousness that we see in corporate customers and by the many products that were bought in the past by consumer customers. I think this is what is the key thing that is behind what we see on the market. when we look at the future, we think we expect to see recovery on the commercial side and also a strong seasonal performance on the consumer side. what gets that commercial side going back, uh, in terms of sales? what gets that growing, uh, in the right direction? we we think there are multiple factors. one is: whatever is the evolution on from a macro perspective? but then, if we think about the specific PC category, window refresh is going to be a major driver of that. you know that there is a discontinuity- discontinuance on some of the previous OS, so that will drive growth is it has happened all the time. there will be some impact on aipc, so we think it will be modest in 2024. and then there is also there will be an positive impact on prices. a combination of of mix and also, as some of the commodity cost will increase, we will see an increase of prices in terms of the aipc, and this is something you and I have talked a lot, uh really a lot about over the past year, year and a half. what does the ramp of uptake look like on those PCS amongst consumers? we, first of all, we continue to be very excited about the value that eips are going to be bringing to customers, because we they will enable them to do many things that they cannot even dream about doing to today. we think that the ramp is going to take about 3 years. our projection is that 3 years after launch, the penetration will be between 40 and 60% and therefore the impact in 24 will be smaller, but we will see it gradually growing in 25 and in 26. the key thing is not only going to be the availability of Hardware that we will be driving, but also to make sure that applications take advantage of the new functionality that PCS will be having. and this is the work that we are doing: working with many of the key application developers to make sure they understand their possibilities and they integrate them in their Solutions within uh. there's a lot of Focus right now, of course, on uh, on AI and Hardware devices, but how important, Enrique, is it that a lot of companies are making more chips and how important is domestic manufacturing of chips in the United States to ultimately bring some of these new AI, PCS, AI, uh cell phones to Market. we we think that during the pandemic, we realized how important resiliency was and to have a more resilient supply chain, whether is chips, of Hardware in general. having a more distributed manufacturing network is important and this is why we were very supported of the chips act to make sure that we saw chips factories being built again in the us, because we think that for the long term, it's going to be really critical to to have those capabilities in the country. how big or how much of your supply chain is still in China? we? China continues to be an important manufacturing platform for us but again, similar to what we were just talking about, chips, we know we need to diversify and we are increasing our manufacturing capabilities and capacity in other parts of the world. we are doing that in North America, we are doing that in in Southeast Asia, in others countries, to make sure that we have a more resilient model going forward. pretty interesting week, Enrique: uh with Google. uh, Google CEO, or alphabet CEO, talking about wrong inputs coming out of their AI models and now they're really scrambling over there to fix it. how concerned are you about the information that an AI PC might put out because of these models. I think, as we look at AI, we need to look at it from two perspectives: the value and the productivity improvements is going to bring, but at the same time, we need to be careful about the bad information and what impact this may have, and we are really supportive of all the actions that are being taking place in different parts of the world to make sure that regulation is put in place to really make sure that drone behaviors are under control. what does it feel like, Enrique, to be running a legacy tech company like an hpn- just an iconic American company of PD and printers- at a time where- and there's so much attention and valuation- uh, our valuations are exploding for a lot of these software players and these chip players and these upand cominging players, uh, in AI that nobody has really heard of. what do you think about that? I I remain very optimistic about the future of the company. I think the changes that we see happening in the technology space driven by AI, the changes that we continue to see in how people work, driven by hybrid work, are opening a tremendous opportunity for HP, and we are driving strong innovation in all these fronts to really be able to capitalize and to lead some of these changes. so, as you know, I have been in the company for a very long time. I am more optimistic now than I have been in the many, many years I have been before HRI. look you still look 27 years old. you know, I, I will say that. I will just say that, uh, that publicly, but actually, before I let you go on that point, you have seen a lot of Cycles. you you've been doing this for for for a good bit. you've lived through the- you knowcom crash and and the financial crisis, and, uh, now this AI situation. what's your read on valuations? you think investors investing in AI are wrong or they just right to be as enthusiastic about some of these companies that, in some cases, they've never even heard of before? I think when, when I look at back at the last 30 years, there has been technology discontinuities that have created a lot of value. think about thecom, ER Evolution 20 years ago, the mobile changes 10 years ago. I think AI is is a SAR disruption that is going to enable the creation of significant value that today we really don't understand how it will H, but I'm sure it's going to happen and is really what opens the opportunity for all, for all of us to be optimistic about the future.",[272]
139,ktpyFHMC3ts,Salesforce is really showing their dedication...to rewarding investors: Macquarie's Fred Havemeyer,Yahoo Finance,2024-02-29 19:59:55+00:00,"Salesforce reported an earnings beat and announced its first ever dividend, but forecasted weaker than expected fiscal full year Revenue. here now, the Chief Financial Officer noted that Salesforce was not factoring in material contribution from AI products, expecting to see it in two or three years. for more on how investors can discern the early beneficiaries of generative AI, let's bring in Fred havm, who is the mcquery head of us AI software research. Fred, always pleasure to speak with you. get some time here. first of foremost, with Salesforce and how they're going to be able to see this factored in to the financial performance in the future. what should investors expect as to the timeline when that'll really pass through to some of the margins that that we're seeing this far? so, with Salesforce, firstly, I think we saw is that the company is once again committed to delivering margin, delivering profitability and doing all of the things that we believe are really critical for the story as a profitable growth Story, one that is prudent about investing and costs. now we're very excited about generative AI, where that's going to go and how Salesforce can benefit from it. but, big picture, we think that the ramp up to material contribution to revenue will take a bit of time, and this is consistent across all of our coverage. we think that generally, Enterprise adoption of generative AI software will begin to take off in 2024, but then rrap further into 2025 and 2026. our base case here is generally that uh Enterprises are beginning with testing generative AI software. they're not necessarily going to deploy it everywhere at once and let customers and their employees just use it immediately. rather, they want to be careful and take their time on ensuring that generative AI products are both safe, reliable and responding as one would expect and one normally would get from an employee of their own company. so I think it's extremely exciting, but we're going to be patient about where and when revenues appear from Ai and in Salesforce model. Fred, one of the big, big headlines out of this print was the fact that the company declared a dividend here, following the footsteps of metam. curious from your perspective- analyst perspective- obviously- what that tells us about the confidence within management, about the future financial success of Salesforce and and how big of a boost do you see this being in the long run. so, with the addition of a dividend here and the company also consistently returning Capital to investors through BuyBacks, what we're seeing is that we believe Salesforce here is really showing their dedication to deploying their cash flows, uh, in ways that are rewarding investors and their confidence in Salesforce. and so, where the company is focusing again on profitability and cash flows and growing those cash flows nicely north of 20% year-over-year in 2025- fiscal 25- they see this as an opportunity to return more cash to shareholders, and I think that it adds to a very- it adds a very nice aspect to this story that you can follow along for the growth, for the upside from AI, but you're also being rewarded with both: more margin, more profitability, more cash flows and, at the end of the day, more cash being returned to investors. you know, I want to go further down that line here because, as we think about where companies and companies like Salesforce, companies like Microsoft, Google, are putting their AI products or Solutions out into the market and and seeing where some of their clients hop on, what the generative AI prompt experience can look like that creates an output, uh, and ultimately creates these co-pilots that come to be expected within the workforce, who is winning the battle of the co-pilot right now? I think it's so early days that it remains an open field. I think, in terms of the technology, open AI still appears to be in a position where they're serving the best models. Microsoft, we think, is leading the charge with productizing these as co-pilots and delivering them to Enterprises. but overall, I think what we've also seen recently with how Gemini has been in the news and responding to uh, uh, uh prompts with outputs that many have begun criticizing recently, I think that it really shows, like the Gemini responses, for example, show how businesses are likely to be very careful with how they're adopting AI, because they need to ensure that the output coming out accurately reflects what their businesses are saying, doing and uh their data, their positioning, Etc. so I think that in this testing phase we're very early days. I think that Microsoft, Salesforce and the like, but Microsoft especially, is the furthest along here and is winning presently the co-pilot debate, but nevertheless, it's extremely early days and we think it's an open, open field for competition. all right, Fred hav Meer mcquary, head of us AI software research. thanks, thank you.",[26]
140,c_uA3BGb4aU,Target: 5 biggest risks for stock amid challenges including competition and inflation,Yahoo Finance,2024-03-05 21:16:10+00:00,"good to have you, Jessica. so there seems to be more headwinds for retailers in this uncertain backdrop. talk to us about the five biggest risks that you see for Target shareholders. yeah, I mean, I think, as you said, we've had some- it's mixed results really what we've had from Target, but I think there's still a lot of pressure for Target and just in the retail space that's geared towards consumer discretionary and it's still very difficult backdrop for the consumer, especially if you look at low-income and middle-income consumer. there's still a lot of pressures out there that are affecting the way they shop and you could clearly see that through what we noted: the number of transactions and the average as well. that was down year-over-year. so again, that I think, shows the the pressure that the customer is still feeling out there. uh, even with that said, we're seeing a big pop and Target shares today up nearly 12% right now. um, at least in the short term here, given some of the head ones that you just highlighted, where do you think the stock tracks? so I think it's a lot of the strategy that Target has done is, again, you know, they're cost cutting, savings and just being much more strategic in the way that they run their business. so we know discretionary isn't doing well. that is the majority of their business. they've been leaning more towards Beauty categories, Home Essentials and those are repeat categories and those again that if you look at the assortment that they drive across those categories it's very strong. they bring in very Niche brands that the consumer is leaning more towards, again, consumer interest Focus. so that has done very well for them. in terms of inventory as well, they really have tracked that to be, you know, more Tighter and run much more productive assortments, even in the categories where there is difficulty. so we're seeing at having good inventory and productive inventory you'll have less promotions. so we track promotions in inventory and pricing and we've seen that really with promotions they've been very strategic. so only promoting what isn't moving and keeping full price at what is moving. again, I think that's the result of what we're seeing in terms of gross margin um. so that in short term is positive and I think even long term they're just running a very Nimble business. also, we're we're hearing there's more investments in evolving their Omni channel strategy, which is perfect, continue to have a seamless operation in terms of AI, in terms of store um productivity- again, all of those shortterm and longterm, I think, are great, and that's what really what we like to hear, because you do have to continue to evolve your experience and continue to evolve in order to survive climates like this and, you know, when we do have a stronger consumer shopping, they'll definitely gain even more off of that. so, Jessica, as you look at the more budget conscious consumer, then if you're a shareholder, why would say, a Target be more appealing than the trying to invest in a Walmart or another retailer? well, I think with Target, you know, long term, they have always been very consumer centri. where we saw the fall at Target, you know a year ago a bit more than that- was inventory problem s and also they. they were, um, a retailer that does tend to lean skew more towards the higher income and it's always a fun place to go. so I think there's just a lot of legs in their business long term and they are set. I think they're a very smart, agile business in the way they've run their inventory and just strategy overall, um, they are one of the first retailers, I think as an effect of Amazon, that invested very heavily in digital very early on and really when we in the pandemic that really took off- I mean, Omni channel was excellent for them. they really had the advantage of that and I think they're gearing up with that again, like I said, you know, with evolving their business. so for the quarters we have been neutral just because we are very cautious that traffic is down so far across a Retail Landscape in this year. I have seen traffic to be down in January and February. I think the target is not um, not part of is part of that as well. sorry, um, but again, long term, if we're evolving the business and we do see all of this traffic come back, they will be winners. Jessica, that's an interesting take because you know, we've heard from so many analysts that Walmart, because it's a little more Diversified, especially on the grocery side, is maybe better positioned in the face of consumers turning a little more cautious. when you look at these two particular names, um, which do you like better in terms of this current moment? because Walmart does have more Staples in his grocery. we do like that story again. they also do offer value with a lot of grocer and that is key right now, with the consumer as a priority of why they're shopping the way they're shopping and again, pulling away from discretionary. I think long term, when that consumer does come back to discretionary. Target does have a much stronger assorment and it's been known for that fun play. you know today they they talked about it on their call- you know you can go into Target without just buying one thing. you come out with so many other bits and they add that fund. so again, once that consumer does come back, longterm I do really like Target again for the climate that we're in now, as long as there is still inflation in food and that is still a major concern for that lower Budget customer, Walmart does have a a favorable Point. Jessica Ramirez at Jane Hol and Associate senior research analyst. good to talk to you today. appreciate the time, thank you.",[107]

Peter, a bit of the Slowdown that we're seeing in the overseas business, obviously very similar to some of the rivals, some of their competitors out there- how big of a headwind do you see that remaining for as you look ahead to the rest of 2024? yeah, you know that it's hard, hard to tell right now how, how big and how long that headwind is going to. last, I mean, they called out France as as one of the issues over in Europe and obviously the Middle East. I think they're both related. there's some negative sentiment going on for Western Brands, uh, in countries like France right now. um, we'll see when that turns around. I, I think you know obviously the war has a lot to do with with it. really don't know when that's going to turn. I think the story right now for dominoes is really more around the US business, uh, and and the growth that they're seeing there, uh, that's been challenging for the past several years. how much do you think that they still need to insert promotions into the US business strategy, given that consumers are trying to Value hack wherever they can right now? so look they' they've had really strong promotions and really strong value for as long as I can remember, they started with 599 mix and match. now they're $66.99. uh, their value proposition is very strong. it's more about how aggressive they advertise it. uh, right now they're advertising more pan pizza and more bundles. uh, I think as we go through the year you'll start to see them pulse back in on the value proposition as well. so I think it's more about advertising, but their value proposition is best in class and will continue to be so going forward. Peter, when it comes to the biggest headwind that you see facing dominoes, obviously inflation has had a real impact on their business. they've been able to offset it a bit, uh, in terms of price. is that a strategy that you think is going to continue to be as effective going forward? yes, inflationary prices are easing just a bit, but the consumer is also being a lot more Discerning in terms of how they're spending their dollars. yeah, so inflation has been a struggle for all restaurants and and dominoes. uh, really, some commodity inflation, but also wage inflation. I think the one that lasts is continues to last is is the wage inflation. they're calling for mid- single digit wage inflation again in 24. that's on top of significant in 23 and 22. so I look I think inflation is going is here here to stay. uh, but keep in mind, if consumers are looking for a value, um, and and ways to leverage their dollars, really there is no better way than the pizza category, and Domino's is the leader on value. so you could feed a family of four for 25- 30 bucks. um, you struggle to do that in any other qsr or any other restaurant out there. W I would say: hold my beer, Peter Sal, thank you so much for taking the time here on the day. certainly do appreciate it. talking all things dominant, all right, great. now I'm hungry again. it's 9:48 am. thanks a lot, Peter. we'll talk soon, thank you.","[50, 383]"

Biden Administration over telling Bloomberg it has not seen any specific or credible threats attempting to disrupt presidential primary voting, Julie. so in the end, we did see Meta shares down about 1.6%, but that seems to have had as much to do with the general Tech selloff perhaps as anything linked to this right. so I think at this point, people are, in general, used to disruptions, uh, when it comes to their social media. so as long as it doesn't last too long, they roll with it and, by the way, of course we always keep the.

Salesforce expects as most $38 billion in Revenue. $ 38.6 billion is what analysts had been anticipating. that said, the earnings per share forecasts are better than estimated for the first quarter uh and for all of 2025. so let me summarize, because that was a lot of numbers I realized. I think the bottom line here is that the revenue forecast for the first quarter and full year are short of estimates. earnings uh forecasts are above estimates, which reflects here The Cutting that we have seen, the pullback that we have seen happen for Salesforce. but I'll be really interested to see what the sales forecast Josh indicates about demand here. I'm sure that we'll be getting some questions on the call about demand. you know, is this a company that is trying to cut its way or is successfully cutting its way to beating estimates at the same time that demand is flagging? yeah, I do see another. another interesting data: point: 2025: their adjusted operating margin forecast of about 32.5%. that's actually a touch higher than at least some of the estimates I was seeing on the street. but but listen, the stock is down about 6% and after hours- obviously this is another name that had this tremendous run into this print- it was up about 80% over the past 12 months. but I think you're right. obviously a lot of immediate questions about the forecast, the guidance. what does CEO Mark benof kind of see in that General environment for Enterprise Demand right now? Julie, um, that'll be a big focus on the call. they remember they also did raise prices. that'll be another question call- what kind of impact is that having on Ben off's business? and, of course, adoption demand, uh, for the company so-called- and Einstein AI platform as well. a couple of other interesting and important things I should note here. the company is starting its first ever quarterly dividend that's going to be 40 cents a share. it is also increasing its share buyback authorization by $10 billion. those are very interesting, especially given the fact that we are not seeing a more positive reaction in the stock here today. A bit surprising, perhaps. I don't know what the expectations were for the numbers for the dividend and for the buyback here, but that's something that Mark benof highlights in the statement here. he also, of course, calls out the Einstein one platform, which is salesforce's AI related product here that it has been coming out with updates on, but again going to be some questions on the call about demand and, uh, something else to mention is that Salesforce had been under some activist pressure. so, um, all of this at play when we're talking about the company. you also in the past have pointed out how well the stock has done, yeah, um, so that's something to keep in mind as well as we look at this, uh, at this reaction, which really does seem to be tied to that sales forecast.",[26]

I mean, actually, treasury yields are up today, um, and so the the economy is strong, inflation's coming down, but it's not that fast. actually, we're getting a bit of a re resurging inflation here. um, so the the fact is is that the part is still going, even though the bar is close. um, usually, when the tap is closed, the part, the party starts to clear out. it hasn't, um, and so we do think that's going to be a headwind for markets is, If the Fed comes back hawkish and we don't get these Cuts baked in, it's going to be tougher for stocks than after this great start to the year. yeah, um, I, I like I. I also am reaching into the memory bags for the for this analogy, Matt. but you know what is going to be: the sort of catalyst, the realization: when is that going to hit the market that you know they got to go home? yeah, it's just treasury yields probably, uh, moving higher from here and you know housing is started. you talked to Greg- uh, last segment, you know just an awesome Economist and talking about how interest rates sensitive the housing market is. well, housing data actually started a rebound to start this year and if mortgage rates come back up because there's just so much risk taking and investors are P pulling away from treasuries and going into, say, Bitcoin or something, um, that's going to cause treasur yelds to rise. and then you've got this circular feedback loop where higher treasury yields weaken housing again and then that causes a a negative growth impulse to the market. um, so we're kind of still pulling off or drafting off of the the decline in treasury yield mortgage rates, and now they're coming up again. um, so I think, basically, to simplify, treasury Ys need to go up until something breaks, and until then, this Market is probably going to be a momentum driven market, and that risk is one, though that could very well come about over the course of this year. and man, another theme I want to touch on with you real quickly.

I mean, let's talk about some of the records that we saw come in for Berkshire hathway: the record cash balance, the profit here. what is most significant, as this company really repositions some of its largest Investments and really looks across where there are Moes, regardless of the economic environment. well, I, I I think birkshire has been in sort of a conundrum for for for quite some time now. um it Buffett gets credit. Buffett and Munger- both you know when, when he was still with the firm um- got credit over the years for being very, very disciplined, especially when it looks at acquisition. so they weren't out there chasing um a lot of deals just to put money to work and the. the byproduct of that is they've had a lot of cash build up on the balance sheet. if we look back at the past five years, they were generating around 25 a half billion a year in free cash flow, and that's, you know, cash flow from operations, less to Capital expenditures. so, beyond sort of the regular money they were putting to work, uh, on capex they were still churning out a ton of cash and it's really hard to sort of dispense of all that Capital every year, and for a while there they were able to sort of offset some of that with Sherry purchases. but the past couple years it it's been harder and harder because the valuation on the firm has gotten higher and higher. so it's been a difficult situation. um, you know, for Burkshire to be in, um, you, we, we were kind of concerned. you know, a few years back, Buffett had made the comment that he couldn't sit here with $150 billion in cash and pretend to shareh ERS that it was something brilliant. um, but back when he said it in 2017, um, short-term rates were at zero. you know, now they're at 5% plus. so we've been a little bit less concerned about that cash balance creeping up past 1550 billion than we thought we would be, but that's because they're earning a lot on that right now. so, from from, from that perspective it's, it's just it's. it's an interesting period for Berkshire right now, and it has been for for a number of years, because they've just not been able to find good enough deals to put the money to work in, which sort of begs the question, you know, is the dividend at some point coming? should Sher P be ramped up? you, I mean, I know, I know Buffett's answer to that, but I think that that's something that the next guys who run the firm are really going to have to address when they take over. and what's your expectation there, Gregory? um, I, I think, longer term, I, I mean, I know Buffett's been, you know, really against the dividend. you know, overall, because you know his, his thought is we could do better with this cash than than most investors. and you know, once you start a commitment to that dividend, you have to sort of stick to it. and- and I understand both of his arguments- but I, I think he's also really sort of leaving that as a tool for the next management team because he doesn't want to sort of commit them to something that they may not be able to sort of maintain over a long long. you know time frame, but you know it. it also gives those guys sort of that ability- you know, Greg Able's, you know at this point the air apparent- to be able to sort of step in and and go to shareholders and say, look, I'm not Warren, I'm not Charlie. you know, we have a ton of capital on the books right now. um, we want to start giving it back to shareholders, and in incremental amounts. this is how we're going to start doing it. you know, give us time to show you that we can still run this business the way it has, because I think that was one of the more interesting things that came out of the, the um annual letter and it was something we've been saying about burer for a long time. you know, Buffett sort of referred to Charlie as the architect of the firm and him the general contractor, and in a lot of ways, Burkshire has been sort of set up as this decentralized organization that kind of runs itself. yeah, you know. so, even if you know Warren and Charlie are no longer there at the helm, the business should continue to run as it has. historically, where Warren and you, Charlie's, you know sort of benefits came into play was on a capital alligation front. you know, and I think what's what's going to happen is once, once Warren's gone, it's going to be harder for management to say: you know, we're going to hold on all this cash right, you know, in anticipation we can do a big deal down the road or whatever else. I just think this be harder and harder. and just with regard to that next big deal down the road, where is that next purchase opportunity? I mean, they've gone heavy into Japanese trading firms. they've gone heavy into accidental petroleum. we've seen how that's played out. uh, they do have some AI bets within their portfolio. if you want to look at Apple, Amazon snowflake. where is that next big purchase opportunity? it, it, it's, it's gotten harder and harder. I mean I, I think, I think we'll probably see more on the stock investment front than we will. outright Acquisitions. I mean I think he even sort of noted that in the, the, the letter this year, that that so many of the businesses that they could buy that would be meaningful, because Berkshire is such a big organization at this point, um have already been picked through and it's. it's really sort of hard to find that next big deal that can be meaningful. I mean, alany was, was, was a stroking genius, you know, with them picking that up because it melded perfectly with their existing organizations and provided a big boost last year to the, to the insurance operations. but finding more deals like that, I think, are just going to be tougher for them to sort of pull off. and he did make the point that you know, outside of the US there aren't a whole lot of things out there that they could really sort of Step Into. You know they've made a commitment to the Japanese firms not to buy more than 10% of their companies. you know, and that's sort of in, in in tandem with, you know, deals and opportunities for them to sort of do Partnerships longer term. but I think it's just been harder and harder for them to find things that are of value. that would really sort of move the needle and and, and I think that that's going to be the, the, the complicated thing for them going forward. you know, I mean I think that the negative risk for for anybody in this position is they go out and do a big deal just to do a big deal. but I don't see Buffett doing that. I mean he's very, very disciplined, extremely disciplined, and has certainly paid off, to say the least, over the years. well morning Stars.

Exxon and China cuk saying that they have a right to counter chevron's bid for hess's Stak in an oil project off the coast of Guyana. now we want to head over to Yahoo finances and Ne for standing by to break it all down. for us and N this could be the start of a very, very, I guess, long-standing dispute. that's right, a lengthy one. now Chevron announced that it was buying Hess last year- you'll recall that- and a big reason for that deal was because of Guyana oil block asset. now exam mobile and China National offshore oil Corporation, cuk, are asserting their right- they're saying- to preempt the purchase of that stake in that oil project, which is a key part of the merger deal. Exxon owns about 45% in the starbor project, of which it's also an operator, and cuk owns about 25% of that project. the other 30% is owned by hes and would be passed on to Chevron as part of the deal. now, in a statement, Exxon Mobile said that it is engaged in conversations with hes and Chevron and those conversations are going to continue. they also said we owe it to our investors and partners to consider our preemption rights in place under our joint operating agreement to ensure we preserve our right to realize the significant value we've created and are entitled to in the Guyana asset there. uh was little Interest really in Guyana. this is a small country next to Venezuela until Exxon Mobile made a big Discovery in 2015, and since then they've made dozens of other discoveries in the region, but this really underscores that value in the Guyana project. it's also a ground Jewel for C, and this is part of the reason- a big reason- why Chevron wants H. in a statement, Chevron spokesperson said that there's no possible scenario in which Exxon or cuk could acquire has his interest in Guyana as a result of the Chevron- hes Transaction. what is the street reaction to this? well, we we're seeing that hes is down about 3%, Chevron is slightly lower, exom mobile up about 8/10 of a percent. this likely could be something that could be extended. I haven't heard any analysts though, guys, that is saying that the deal is off because of this, but certainly a challeng or a roadblock, so to speak. well, well, we certainly be keeping tabs on whether any of the analysts change their tune, for sure.

149,1r1eB0uJM_c,Apple cancels EV plans,Yahoo Finance,2024-02-28 03:00:02+00:00,"apple is reportedly ditching its decade old effort to build an electric vehicle. that's according to Bloomberg. joining us now Yahoo finances, Rick Newman and Dan Howley. um, Rick, what caught our eye following this story was the fact that you wrote back in 2015 that it would be insane- I believe was your word- to think that we were going to see apple cars coming off the assembly line, and it took them a while. but you were right. why did you think it was not going to come to pass? and how does why it actually hasn't come to pass sort of match up with what you expected? well, if Apple wants to uh call me about strategic Consulting, I'm willing to take their call. um, so I'm talking about, um, the, the complete car. uh, in my point back in 2015, which I I think is still completely valid today, is that manufacturing something com as complicated as an automobile is just not where Apple needs to go. for two words, profit margin. um, Apple's profit margin is about 26%. uh, that's mostly. I mean, we know what their devices are, but really that's a lot of intellectual property and a lot of software. that's the business that you want to be in these days. so, uh, a profit margins for comparison. so Apple's at 26. that's awesome. uh, Tesla is only at 16% profit margin. Toyota, probably the best uh run car company in the world, is 10% profit Marg, and then GM and Ford are in the single digits. and it's just a complicated business. it's a cyclical business. there's a ton that can go wrong. uh, even Elon Musk, at some point during the last decade, when they were struggling just to make a profit, he said, wow, manufacturing is really hard. so it makes a lot of sense for Apple to be involved with the electronics and the software and the brains of automobiles, because there is a lot of money there. I just never thought it' fit with their business model at all to roll, to roll automobiles off an assembly line. so so I guess, Rick, um, the next question I have for you then, if it's not going to be cars, you know what? what do you think is the, the big Market that Tim Cook moves into, that can actually move the needle for a company the size of Apple? do you think it's gen, AI related products? you think it's? is it healthc care? is it, you know, mixed reality with the, with the Vision Pro, or so maybe some combination of all those? so let's let Dan Howley talk about, um, what they might do outside of the car business, but apple is not going to abandon the car business. they want to be associated with the car and there's been this big battle underway for more than a decade among all the automakers and uh, apple and uh and Google and um Blackberry actually make software for cars. I mean, there are a lot of companies that make software for cars and they want to. um, they want that as a business line because of everything, uh, people do in their cars and everything people do that is associated with their cars. they want to know where you are, they want to know when you're passing um their store. uh, they want to be able to send you coupons somehow, because they know that you're driving past a McDonald's or something like that. I mean they're. I'm sure that is that market is going to develop. um, so I think Apple will stay, will definitely keep trying to go after that business. I mean, again, those are service businesses. that is not bending metal, um, so I mean that's what Apple does and I think that's where Apple wants to stay. um. so, Dan, in that case then let's talk about the Gen AI piece, because, according to this report, Tim Cook, when he announced it to the, to the workforce, that he was going to be winding down the car project, he said some of that's going to be potentially redeployed to geni. but like doing what? because, as we know, Apple has not said a whole heck of a lot about that. yeah, so the the kind of gen AI portion of this is is kind of strange. right, they've been working on generative AI, uh, they've said in the past, or at least in the the most recent earnings call, Tim Cook had specifically said that they're working on generative AI stuff, uh, and that they'll have more uh in the year ahead, uh, that they've been working feverishly on it. they, they were caught somewhat flat-footed, um, compared to the likes of Google or Microsoft, you know, especially compared to Microsoft, which got on this bandwagon right away, um, but you know, I think, as far as what the, the capabilities will be or or uh, how it might start to, you know, roll out across uh products from the car side of things, it's hard to tell um, especially since you know this is a project that's been going on for so, so long. uh, these people will have to be caught up on what, what's going on with geni, uh, and then start to work into that. you just, I mean it's. it seems like a, like an odd call out. to me it seems like it's more, it's it's less of. let's get more investment in in gen and more let's save some money on not rolling out a car.",[1]

Bob Iger, not mincing words, saying, does not want this to distract from the core of the business. he said- quote: I'm working really hard to not let this distract me because when I get distracted, everyone else gets distracted. that diverts the focus of the company and we really need to be focused in order to deliver shareholder value. he pointed to the complexities of Disney's business overall. you have multifaceted segments. you have a lot of those segments undergoing severe pressure, like streaming. he said it's not only a business that takes a significant amount of knowledge, but it also takes a significant amount of focus. so he's really just concentrated on the issues at this company, and there are quite a few. right now. we have Studio output not performing as well as expected. we have a slowing Parks business. the stock has recovered from those multi-year lows since Nelson pelts first launched that proxy fight, but there are still a lot of overhanging issues that shareholders have questions with and, uh, the proxy battle is certainly a distraction, not only for ier, but I also think, a distraction on the part of shareholders as well, when they're trying to parse through this company and really what the future holds moving forward. yeah, one of the other things that he addressed during the conference is something that I, even a Marvel fan like myself, has experienced, which is Marvel fatigue. right, that there's just so much content out there. yeah, and he's admitted that there has been an overproduction of content, and this stems back from when Disney plus first debuted. they really wanted to pump out as much content as possible, create a lot of Marvel shows, create a lot of Star Wars shows then. then it led to this Marvel fatigue. but he did press back against that, saying that he doesn't think consumers have fatigue when it comes to certain really good shows. that's what he said. he said if a movie is good, if a show is good, people will come out and see it. right, but not everything has been equally good exactly, and I think that's his point. there there's been um a missing link. here there's a missing, there's lack of creativity- that's the word he's continuously used- and he even said that they had to go back and scrap certain movies and project. he said they haven't been public about that, but that they've really been trying to parse through their catalog of content and make sure that they're not just releasing movies and TV shows just for the sake of releasing movies and TV shows. so we'll see. they do have a significant slate coming out in the back half of this year. we have the Moana sequel, um, we have the kingdom of Planet of the Apes coming out as well. it's all sequels. again, it's all sequels. it's all franchises. but analysts have also said that's sort of what the company needs. I mean, listen, I'm going to watch the Moana sequel. don't get me wrong, everyone will. hopefully the music's as good as the first. yeah.",[32]

Yahoo finances. Alexander Canal is here with the detail CT. I guess I didn't realize, Disney didn't? I thought everybody had a CTO at this point. yeah, and, and you know, and, and this is the latest development in this proxy battle with Disney, Blackwells, along with Nelson pelts, two activists that are going for more board seats at the company, and now black is laying out some of the changes, or more changes I should say, that it wants to see at the company and it says: from a technological standpoint, Disney is lacking in five areas, including fragmentation, unhurried Innovation, missing native technology stack, spatial Computing and AI mediocrity. yes, Blackwell saying, quote: Disney must produce an artificial intelligence strategy and share elements of that strategy with its shareholders. Blackwell's also suggested that Chief technology officer to focus on technology transformation. I do want to say that Disney has been researching new technologies. they did establish that AI task force last last year to really study how artificial intelligence could be implemented across the company, which is something that Blackwells did not acknowledge. so it just sounds like this activist doesn't think Disney is doing enough in comparison to the other tech companies out there to really utilize AI. uh, this is also a hedge fund and activist that has made other suggestions saying that Disney should potentially break up, saying that it's uh, hotel and Parks business should be potentially spun out into a separate Real Estate Investment Trust, and these are all things that Disney has really pushed back on. saying this shows how black Wells just doesn't understand our business, because we Thrive off of the Synergy between all of the different components of our business. so Disney, you know, for its part, has been in constant communication with its shareholders and really urging them to stick with the current board. that any of these other board nominees from these activists it's going to throw off the progress or overall, but we'll see. the shareholder meeting is April 3rd, so we don't have to wait too much longer to figure out how this all ends. that's a lot of drama. thank you Ally much appreciate it.",[32]

Andrew, it's good to see you today. congratulations on another strong quarter here from the company. so your sales were up 11%. the in the latest this quarter. you're across multiple Industries. talk to us just about what the underlying demand looks like for your products and services. yeah well, thank you, sha, and thank you for having me on the on the show. look, there's a couple of things that really underpin what's going on here. one: we're a very diverse business. we make things, we make software for people that make everything: Bridges, roads, buildings, products, you name it. somebody makes it with our software. but underpinning the environment for our customers, regardless of any short-term issues, is is they have real sustained long-term capacity challenges. there's not enough money, there's not enough people, there's not enough resources to make, remake, manufacture, produce everything that needs to be made, and that's what's driving the ongoing and continual technology investment through for with us and with other players that are helping them get ahead of this capacity challenge. certainly, and and so this is a multi-year process that you've talked about developing certain life cycle Solutions here. when you think about that multi-year process, I mean, how long are we talking? what should investors be tracking up against in order to see that filter through to some of the margins for the business? yeah, look, I think what you're seeing right now is the impact of those life cycle solutions that we've been rolling out. obviously, we have a robust down Downstream business in construction now, which is really part of connecting design and making the architecture engineering construction industry. people are buying into that and we saw a lot of strength in our Enterprise customers exactly because they were buying into to our connected solution from design to construction. so you're already seeing that today it's happening. there's there's going to be more showing up as customers continue to invest in the deeper Integrations of life cycle Solutions we bring to Market and, of course, with the rise of the automations that are going to be coming from AI. Andrew, what does the runway look like for AI adoption? I'm curious just to get your perspective as a key AI player. many investors view your stock as that as well. what do you make of this excitement that we've seen surrounding the technology over the last several months? well, you know there's always a hype cycle on these things, right? you know the the real rewards with AI go to those who continue to produce meaningful outcomes with the technology. remember, we've been in this, this game, for at least a decade. we've been delivering machine learning based, AI based solutions to our customers for a while and we we have a long-term path for how we're going to improve the way our customers work with what they do today- the processes they have today- but also just disrupt their processes quite significantly with new types of AI tools. so there's going to be an ongoing patient delivery of Technology. there may also be a hype cycle out there where some people get disillusioned with AI in the short term, but you got to ignore that. the long-term potential here is gigantic. are we just scratching the surface, Andrew, when it comes to the AI cycle? oh, I think we are absolutely scratching the surface. I think what's happened here is things like chat, GPT and now. now all of the tools are associated with image and video creation. these have made AI real. for people who didn't understand it before, it's understandable. I can see what it does. I can see the potential and this is why people get excited, because now they understand it. we've always understood it and you have not even begun to see the kinds of impacts AI is going to have on how people get their work done in the future. Andrew, back when I thought I was up to Snuff to be an architect, I I was taking some architecture and design classes in in high school and I remember using AutoCAD for the number of businesses that you've been able to add on for Autodesk here in manufacturing, media and entertainment, uh, all of these things considered, where is that next major segment that you think is going to unlock the next kind of inflection point or or growth point for Autodesk? you know, Brad, so you really highlight the Journey of the companies on. you know, AutoCAD Standalone AutoCAD is now less than 20% of the companies Revenue. right, we're. we're a 3D modeling company and a life cycle Solutions company, and one of the things it's definitely unlocking that- that next phase of growth- is this move to integrating the design and make life cycles together. but there's also interesting opportunities ahead with helping owners do exciting and interesting things with some of these new technologies so that you not only manage how you design and make something, but how you use it over its entire life cycle. what about Healthcare? I mean, that's the one area that that's not really mentioned here and I I feel like for a lot of the areas that that Autodesk certainly could lean into- you've already got media and entertainment, you've already got manufacturing- it seems like there's there's that other kind of area that has a lot of spending: billions of dollars, that trillions of dollars that goes into it as a system. you know where is perhaps that industry Focus as well? yeah, you know, Brad, you're you're poking right at something that's really right in The Sweet Spot of where we service our customers. healthc care is absolutely one of the growth segments for our Solutions. they're investing a lot in building out new healthare facilities- not just Mainline hospitals but Senior Care Facilities, assisted living facilities- and they're also at the front line of investing in some of our digital twin technology, which helps them run and operate the facilities to the Fidelity that they need to operate them at. hospitals are, you know, highly managed facilities that have lots of environmental concerns and and, uh, also, you know, safety concerns associated with them. so they actually are very interested in some of the latest technology to manage the whole life cycle, the building that gets created.",[158]

I mean, look, the iPhone is a great device, but how many people are stoked every year that it comes out. it's it's the hype gets less and less and less. it's more begrudgingly that you have to actually update your iPhone, because either it's less, yeah it's, it's no longer like man, I can't wait to get it. and it's like, oh, a new one's coming out, cool, what does this one do? uh, I'll hold off for two years. D? I think. the question, though, for analysts at least, is, now that they are not any longer spending money on the EV business, they're reallocating those funds. what does that, though, tell us about potential competition and Apple's ability, then, to compete with the companies that are very much viewed as a leader within the AI space? well, I think- look, you know, obviously, it's Microsoft, it's Google, uh, meta, uh, Amazon. you know, Amazon do doesn't advertise their AI as much, but I mean, they've- they've been in this space for for quite a while with AWS, but I think you know apple, with their huge, you know, uh, chest of treasure, uh, otherwise known as a treasure chest- uh, they'll be able to go ahead and and hire the right people and start working this out, uh, in a way that brings some form of generative AI to everybody's uh- iPhones, iPads, Macs. you know what have you? what it looks like, though, I think is is still up in the air. you know we've seen Google and Samsung roll out some features for smartphones. it's it's largely with know photos. uh, there's some where you can change the uh tone of your text messages. right, that's not a killer app to me. it's also not really important, uh. so I think you know it. it remains to be seen where that is, and I think you know we. we talk so much about generative AI, but I think that's part of the problem is we don't Chad gbt blew everyone away, right, okay, cool. what are you going to do now? what's going to be the product that gets me to want to buy a new iPhone because of generative Ai, and I haven't seen anyone really do that yet.",[1]

I think that. I mean, I think the the impetus for this probably was um. you know uh, for all intents and purposes, was the, the recent um, the recent incident uh. you know they, what they released from the initial NTSB report, uh was that. you know there was some rework going on um from the uh spirit plant at the Boeing facility, uh and uh, you know, I think there's probably a thought process and I- I think you know the FAA administrator Whitaker uh, probably alluded to that- uh sort of behind behind the behind the scene talks with, with Boeing that you know you sort of own the, you own the jet from uh Soup To Nuts, And I think Boeing probably took that to heart and you know it just, it just makes sense. imagine if GM were to have a third party, you know, build his chases versus, you know, in Flint, in Flint, Michigan, or or essentially any other company, large manufacturer company. it just, it just, I think it's a, it's just a natural, um, it's just a, it's a natural way to do business to own such a large part of your manufacturing process.",[78]

Durk, always nice to get some time with you uh. so really, uh, I think your presentation down at kagne uh was well received. lots of focus on the top line and that is a little bit also the vibe uh at the kagne conference. what are you doing to to get your Topline growth rates the next level this year? first of all, thanks for having me, Brian. it's always a pleasure to to be here. um, I would say that um for us, a continuous investment in Our Brands and not trying to drive the bottom line at any cost, but always reinvesting half of the extra margin we grow every year into our brands, has proven to be a very good recipe for us. so that's for sure, something that we will continue to do going forward. we've done it in in the last five years it has worked well. the last time we last time, yeah, yeah, last time we talked, Durk, you really you put a lot of emphasis- and I think it was milkin last year- a lot of emphasis on the Oreo brand and how big that brand has gotten in terms of importance for your company, in terms of sales, in terms of profits. how do unlock further growth in a big growth driver like that? well, the two biggest markets for Oreo are the US and China, and there the brand has over 10% market share in the biscuits Market. um, there's no other country in the world where Oreo has that type of a market share, but it's a, it's a yard stick, it's where we can get. so there is this geographical opportunity in all the other countries in the world to bring Oreo to the same level as the US and China. and then in the US and China, it's about keeping the brand active. if, if I look at Oreo, the penetration per year is is, uh, is quite high in the US, but there is still opportunity and it's only once a year, so we can increase what we call the frequency of consumption, um, many, many more times than we have today. so even in the US and China. there's a huge opportunity for us by just getting consumers- uh, irregular consumers- to be more regular consumers. um, and then I would say to, to keep the brand alive and to make sure that it really connects. we try to link it to the, to, to the actuality of the moment anywhere in the ball. so we, we were in the Super Bowl with our spot. there's big things coming in the second half. we've done, uh, Pac-Man, we've done Lady Gaga, so we keep the brand active and that attracts consumers. they want to have the special addition related to that, and we have a whole pipeline of things we can do with the brand. so, keeping it top of Mind of consumers, driving the penetration and driving the frequency, I think the runway for Oreo is, is, is, is really big for the future. one of my interpretations, Derk, from the the presentation was that U mandelay, is is ramping up efforts to make a larger push at us convenience stores. what do that exactly look like and how large is that sales opportunity? oh, it's, it's well over a billion dollars or more for us. um, as a company, we are very well represented in the grocery stores. that's, that's our strength. where we not so well represent is inconvenience store. yes, of course you will find Oreo, you will find rits, you will find Cliff bar, but it's it's a bit fragmented, it's not the nice solid presence that you would expect, and so we have a real opportunity there, and so for us to get organized, to really work on the route to Market, our in store presence represents a a really big opportunity for us. in US, consumers have really- and we saw a little bit of this yesterday in Walmart's earnings- consumers appear pushing back on a lot of the price increases that were taken during the pandemic from a lot of food manufacturers. uh, how do you, what do you just say to Consumers that are tired of these price increases, and are you seeing cost come down for your business? I'll start with the last part. unfortunately, we don't. I know it has to happen at a certain stage, and what is annoying for us is that, whatever the increases were two years ago, in last year, those uh cost it was Transportation or it was packaging, or, uh, some of the oils we use, they're not increasing anymore and some of it is coming down. but this year cocoa, sugar and hazelnuts are really going up in a in a quite significant way. so it obliges us again to do price increases. we would prefer not to, but unfortunately the inflation on the cost side for us is not uh, not stopping what? what I would tell consumers is that it's an affordable uh Indulgence or an affordable luxury. it's time for you yourself. it's not a big spending uh, it's something you can do on a day-to-day basis and that's what we see from consumers. we've had to increase our prices in the last two years quite significantly, but we saw almost no elasticity. consumers want their Oreo, they want their rits, they want their Cliff bar and, and so, um, I would say I, I, I hope that the consumers will stick with Our Brands. uh, for another round of prices. it's not that big in the US because it's largely the chocolate brands- chocolate, grass, milk, Cadbury- that are affected this year because of the cocoa prices. so the price increases in biscuits are very limited. so I hope the consumer will understand that and uh be loyal to Our Brands, which so far they've done. so I feel pretty confident about that. one of your competitors, uh in the chocolate, Cy Hershey, yesterday talked about double digigit price increases because, to your point, cocoa prices have they've gone through the roof. are you looking at similar increases? yes, yes, we are not very represented in the chocolate Market in the US. the US consumer will not necessarily see that in in Our Brands but, um, in Europe, where we have milai and Cadbury and so on, yes, we are looking at the same double digit price increases in chocolate. under your leadership, Durk, you really have repositioned or reinvented Mones: a cliff bar acquisition, a series of Acquisitions. you have a really, I think a lot of folks on the street commend you for the work you've done there and also improving your balance sheet. a lot of cash, uh, are you open to doing another deal this year? and what's your sense on the valuations? on on some snack burs? yeah, and yes, we are open. uh, m&a- well taught through, financially disciplined m&a- is part of our equation. it has worked well for us. I think we're we're good at it, but we won't do it at any cost or at any price. it's not like we have to. we have very solid organic growth as a company and we can make the company grow out- grow, I think, most of our competitors- just in an organic way. but m&a helps because it fills the gaps that we have around the world. um, what I'm seeing is there is certainly more interest in deals. valuations are not coming down because there is more interest. the expectations of valuations are going up, but with the higher interest rates and the slower growth, it's much more difficult to get a return on on your acquisition. so I, I, I, we don't want to do crazy things. we are, we, like I said, we're disciplined. if it financially doesn't make sense to us, we won't make the deal. um, but there will be opportunities and, yeah, we are working on potentially more deals this year, but I cannot tell you if they will come through, yes or no, at this stage. Before I Let You Go, you tease that more tease, some more big potential Partnerships, anything that works with Taylor Swift. you know that's a standard question. now, DK, we have to ask all, all companies if they're working with her. I cannot say anything until it's signed, so I I have to stay mute on the subject, but there is some very interesting stuff coming up on Oreo, I can tell you that. all right, fair enough. thank you for always uh making time for us, Dirk Van, to put uh M's chairman in. see, we'll talk to you soon, thank you.",[96]

Michael, great to have you here with us this morning. uh, you look through this report. ultimately, what? what is the takeaway? as you hear Lowe's talking about, uh, unfavorable January. you hear them talking about the DIY impact that they're seeing as well in some of those projects being pushed out. yeah, sure, well, the fourth quarter was down, but we knew that and was actually down a little bit, uh, less than expected, and it wasn't a bad quarter, uh, at all. as relates to the Outlook next year, again, we knew they'd guide to a lower number in 2024 than in 20- 23. uh, it was. it was a little bit softer than expected, but but not too bad at all. uh, we think they're sort of, you know, doing well internally, uh, against a tough macro backdrop. for instance, their expenses were flat on a year over-year basis relative to sales, despite a really big decline in sales. so they're controlling what they can well. gross margin up slightly. that's all good, uh, against a tough environment. so I think that's why the stock did open down a little bit, but now it's back up because- because I think seeing the company control what they can pretty well here. so, Michael, the company's doing what it can to control some of those costs. but when we talk about the recovery, I guess from what we learned today from these from the most recent quarter, how far out does that then push this recovery timeline? yeah, not 2024 may, maybe second half of 2024, uh, but but we don't want to sort of get too far ahead of ourselves. uh, yet we think SS for sales will continue down, uh, certainly for the first half of the year and probably even further the second half of the year. so still a little bit uh. to go on the housing recovery here, um, getting better, but but not, we're not looking for positive until you know, maybe early 2025 and and so for some of the projects that are are being pushed out, it's not just the DIY, it's also that pro segment too. where do you kind of read into that and and get a sense of where this could potentially still continue to be a lingering headwind for lows? sure the the industry is soft on both sides, for sure uh. Lowe's, though, is taking share on the pro side, and their Pro business was actually flat year of year, not bad at all in this environment. compare that to uh Lowe's- uh sorry, to Home Depot, who had a negative uh Trend in their Pro business. so Lowe's is taking share in Pro now, to be fair, from a smaller base relative to uh to Home Depot, but uh, Pro is probably uh would be considered a bright spot in in Lowe's quarter. again, uh posit or flat. I should say um, better, better than uh, better than the industry. Michael, when it comes to what would be fair value here for lows, given the movement that we' seen in the stock, some of that uncertainty already being priced in, has that been priced in up until this point? we think it has. uh, you know we think uh lows, uh again. all expectations were for a negative comp and to be negative uh for 2024, again, maybe a little bit softer than expected, but but no surprises here. uh in the way the trend is going and and the valuation uh is is about average versus history uh, but but we think pretty, uh, pretty modest at this point. this, this Total Home strategy that the company has put forward that we've heard Marvin Ellison talk about as well here. where would you say that they're at in in that total buildout of the strategy and implementation as well right now, yeah, you know the they're doing uh, still still room to go uh on that again, as I said, they're doing well uh relative to a tough environment, but they still lag Home Depot in a number of areas, particularly on the pro side, and we think that's, you know, a key part of the strategy is to grow that Pro business uh. in fact, that's probably the biggest uh difference in total sales per store between Home Depot and lows. their DIY sales per store are actually pretty similar um, but the uh, the, the proide uh lows less than half of of what Home Depot does in terms of proales. so that's the biggest area where they can continue to improve. all right, Michael Baker, great to get your Insight here this morning. da Davidson, managing director in senior research analyst.",[57]
160,12f_TT3fjgE,DOJ launches investigation into UnitedHealth over antitrust concerns,Yahoo Finance,2024-02-28 17:26:02+00:00,"the latest earnings results from retailers, giving us that inside look into the state of the consumer. so let's break down some key takeaways, starting with the state of department stores. so we heard from Macy's earlier this week. this is one of our big takeaways that we have been tracking throughout this earning season and especially with retailers, and Macy's particularly came to mind here because of some of the weakness. Morning Star Equity analyst, David Schwarz, joined us this week and he said: at this point it's hard to have a lot of confidence at all on Macy's turnaround plan, and it's a massive turnaround plan. it layoffs restructuring plan and then additionally closing 150 stores. this just the start of Tony Springs tenure over at Macy's? it certainly is, and I think it highlights some of the struggles that we're seeing play out Beyond Macy's into other parts within the sector. we've talked for a long time about Nordstrom, the fact that that company's struggling. when you take a look at coal, so many of these larger players within the department store space- they're trying to rightsize the ship right now, trying to adjust their business for what the consumer wants and needs. at this point, a lot of that means more heavily investing in online- online. when you take a look at Rivals: obviously, Walmart and Amazon. that was one of the uh strategic moves laid out from Macy's new CEO, Tony spring, just in terms of some of the investment there and what they plan to do in fulfillment center. so until that transition takes place, you can expect some of these department store names to remain Under Pressure. the second Trend that we want to point out here, when it comes to the consumer and really giving us a good look as to how Shoppers are feeling right now, is the rise and popularity of the private label products. now, this is a trend that we have been talking about now over the last couple of quarters and it is continuing here into this quarter even. uh, just earlier this week, Target coming out announcing a brand new uh private label line that most of their products are going to be in the range of1 to $10. and why we're pointing this out is because, yes, inflationary pressures have eased just a bit, but still, clearly, Shoppers are feeling the pain of higher prices and they're forced to make some of these adjustments as a result. and that's all part of the value Consciousness that a lot of Shoppers are deploying right now, and when you think about some of those private label Brands and the broader kind of play into that trade down type of mindset. that's exactly where companies like TJ- well, tar, I should say- or Target, and then additionally Walmart, where we've heard them continue to lean into some of those brands that are homegrown. finally, here though, we got to talk about a little bit of luxury. it's a little luxury, though just very little, and it comes out in a couple different formats here, particularly in that beauty category, the, the Cosmetics category as well. and I'll hearken back to Macy's just once again, cuz that was one of the bright spots actually of their report. blue Mercury- one bright spot in the Macy's earnings this week- Poise for acceleration, the CEO said, over the next 3 years as well. they're anticipating about 30 blue Mercury store openings, remodel roughly 30 others as well. and then you think about where else this is played out within the little luxuries landscape. it's elf, elf everyone, and that ticker symbol has been rocketing over the past year, up 170%, 44% higher year-to date. they reported earnings, they raise guidance. they also have three consecutive periods of doing so here. so that's another name that's been on the minds of a lot of analysts out there. yeah, and djx was one of the companies that was out before the Bell this morning and they are seeing spending on some of the Cosmetics, those types of uh purchases that really have outperformed over the last couple of quarters, and you've got a lot of people asking whether or not the beauty industry is relatively Recession Proof when you compare it to some of the spending trends that we've seen U more broadly within the sector.",[14]
161,E-rjp2TQDhw,"What Macy's, Lowe's Q4 results mean for the future of retail",Yahoo Finance,2024-02-28 01:00:05+00:00,"well retail results out this morning for Macy's and Lowe's, both stocks surging as they beat expectations in their latest quarters, despite seeing sales Fall. we also got a somewhat downbeat report from the conference board, consumer confidence falling to 106.7 in February. that is from a revised 11- 10.9 in January. joining us now on this is sushita kodali, Forester, Forester research retail analyst. good to talk to you today. let's start with Macy's, because we are seeing that stock up in a big way- nearly 4%. what did you like? uh, based on the results we got, well, Macy's exceeded expectations, but the numbers, by no stretch of the imagination, were wonderful. um, the sales for the last several quarters had been down in the mid single digits and this past quarter, I think, was perceived positively because it was down, but only in the low, in that, in the in the very, very low single digits. um, some of the things that actually concerned me are that its digital sales numbers were down lower than its Brooks and mortar numbers. that is unheard of. typically in retail, everyone's digital sales numbers are stronger, um, but for them to have softer digital sales in a world where more Shoppers are consuming through e-commerce suggests to me that they may be losing disproportionately a lot of market share and certainly, as they are closing 150 stores over the next several years, that some of that market share presence, um, that story doesn't look great when you look ahead. yeah it, it doesn't look great and, as you point out, I mean this is a company that is still trying to find the right turnaround mix. right, we are seeing the company closed those Macy's stores. they're trying to focus more on the highend, with blooming dels as well as blue Mercury. what does that mean for the Macy's brand? well, I think that the Macy's brand ends up being um some of the really really premium um Flagship locations. um, I think that they're going to try to hold on to the heral square store um, for the sake of of their balance sheet. hopefully they're able to hold on to it um, but they're. they may end up doing some sort of a sale, lease back and um unlocking some of the cash that is in that store, um. so certainly there is um some real estate. that is really the the big asset that Macy's um has. but your point is a good one, which is that they do seem to be diversifying to these other brands. so they're opening nearly as many blue Mercury stores as their closing Macy's stores? um. so blue Mercury is often in some of the newer malls. it's in higher foot traffic locations, um, and it's very it's more, it's high, it's it's good margin because it's beauty products, but, um, it's a small store and each individual location is not going to make up for what they're probably losing from a top line, from from Macy, from the closure of a Macy store. so I think really, it's um, it's it's becoming a smaller company, um, but the hope is is that that the profitability story improves by investing in highend luxury, with blooming Dales and Beauty, with blue mercur Mercury suita, with with Macy specifically, though I mean we're it feels like the company is moving away from the large department stores we know Macy's to have to a smaller footprint. you know, is that? is that where retail is going? is that the right strategy here? when you consider what you pointed out? they're not even getting the bump in digital right now, right, well, I don't think that it's the story it's. it's a great story in the department store sector and it's not a great story for a lot of Mall merchants um to have these large physical Footprints, especially because in many of Macy's categories, like apparel, Footwear, um more and more of their shares of sales are migrating to e-commerce and the web anyway. but that's not to say that every large store is suffering. I mean, you look at the warehouse club sector. it's doing very well. Mass Merchants like Walmart and Target are generally doing very well. there are large box stores that are um continuing to grow like Tractor Supplies so um. so I don't think that the story of large box is a bad one, but keep in mind all of those companies that I just mentioned- not none of them really have presence in the indoor malls that Macy's is in. let's talk about the companies you do like: Walmart, Amazon, Costco, another one, um. is it about sort of staying in the grocery Lane right now or more Diversified retailers in this environment? we? we're seeing more and more that consumers are being a little more discriminatory and how they dll out some of their discretionary spending. yeah, the consumer is spending in um very specific categories now. so certainly food is one um. the mass merchandise sector is is another with a lot of consumables. Beauty and health- um are actually doing pretty well. when you look at even Walmart, some of their strongest numbers are in their health and wellness segment um. so that's a sector that is is absolutely resilient um, and that's also interestingly um, arguably part of you know kind of some of the bright spots in the m in the Macy's portfolio is where some of the blue Mercury numbers are um, so there are places where consumers are spending. consumers are also spending a lot at food away from home, um, which is the restaurant sector. that's been disproportionately positively um affected and has been growing incredibly strongly in the last several years. so there are places where, in spite of lower consumer confidence, The Shopper is is still spending um, and you know some of those brands that that we did talk about that are doing well um are certainly leveraging um some of the success in in grocery in recent months, but are also just the places where consumers often trade to if they are feeling economically pinched um, so that's, that's part of it too. those are- those are often Recession Proof businesses like a Walmart or um an Amazon or a Costco, because people go there when times are good. people go there when times are not so good. finally, we did get the consumer confidence index today um, that falling after three straight months of gains. you know, economic data seems to point to the fact that things are pretty resilient and yet consumers aren't necessarily feeling that great. what do you think's going on? this has been an issue for months now, where the consumer says one thing and has been doing something different and um the consumer confidence numbers. when you dig into um who is particularly distressed or who is um perceiving that perhaps the economy is in worse shape. some of it is politically aligned, some of it is um younger consumers that may be taking on more expenses, like paying back student loans. some of it may be um the consumers that that that that are not um, that are either unemployed or um have experienced some hardships in um transitioning to to other employment opportunities. so there are sectors that certainly are expressing um dismay and that, I think, is dragging down some of those consumer confidence numbers. but when you look at the overall levels of Shopper spend, those levels are incredibly high and they're much higher than 2019 levels, and I think that it's very, very difficult to reconcile. well, if people are so distressed, why is it that they're spending as much? and it suggests that maybe there are a lot of people that are not that distressed um because wages are at an all-time high and overall unemployment is relatively low and the labor market is tight.",[57]

163,pnO7e16QveA,EU regulators take an interest in Apple-Epic Games dispute,Yahoo Finance,2024-03-07 19:45:04+00:00,"apple is facing more regulatory scrutiny. EU Regulators are set to question apple on its recent Feud with epic games and its App Store rules. let's waiting Yahoo finances Dan Hy to give us the details. so, Dan, walk us through where we are now and how we gotten here. yeah, so we'll start from where how we got here. this is basically all comes back to uh, uh, epic games and apple Showdown. where epic wanted to uh provide consumers with a thirdparty means of purchasing items inside of games. uh, Apple doesn't allow that through the App Store. when epic went ahead and did that on their own, Apple basically pulled fortnite and suspended epic games from being able to use the app store. epic, knowing that this would happen, sued Apple. uh and then basically uh in California. what ended up happening was Apple was not found to be a monopolist, but it did have uh. what the court said were some anti- steering uh rules uh, and so they had to address those. now, where this recent spat comes from uh is the EU and the digital markets act, and apple basically uh says that: look we, I can't, we can't trust uh epic. we need to put uh in place a kind of a back, a block from them. we're not going to let them use our platforms, uh, because of the, the prior issues we have with them. and epic saying, look, the digital markets act, uh, which allows for thirdparty app stores on things like iOS, uh is in place and we should be allowed to put our app App Store there. so, uh, what we're hearing from the, the two companies, is basically, you know, obvious ly completely opposite. so, uh, first, we have a statement from epic where, uh, they say, apple is taking one of the largest potential competitors to the Apple App Store, which would be, uh, that epic game store. uh, they are undermining our ability to be a viable competitor and they are showing other developers what happens when you try to compete with apple or are critical of their unfair practices. now, essentially, what uh epic is saying there is: look, uh CEO Tim Sweeney uh went ahead criticized apple and its U digital markets act Maneuvers, as well as uh its its moves in the US, and they're saying that that's why Apple is is not letting epic run any app store on iOS in the EU. now, apple, on the flip side, had this to say: epic's egregious breach of its contractual obligations LED courts to determine that Apple has the right to terminate any or all of Epic Games wholly owned subsidiaries, Affiliates and or other entities under epic games control at any time. Apple chose to exercise that right. that uh comes from that California Court uh ruling, and so you know how that exactly plays out with the EU. I, I, I don't know uh, but you know it really comes down to two companies that are just at loggerheads over what they believe they should be allowed to do uh on iOS and for Apple, they're not going to give this up. obviously this is something that they're going to to hold on to uh. they're trying to make uh moves that allow them to continue to remain in control of of iOS and the App Store. and for epic, look, they have a mountain of money from fortnite uh, and so they're going to go ahead and continue to fight this as well. what it ends up doing is making apple look bad and making epic look bad. so we'll see if either or decides to pull back or doesn't, or if the EU makes some decision. now they're starting to probe apple and its decision to pull uh epic games ability to put games onto the App Store in the EU. certainly a legal battle there, where you consider the California ruling versus what? what the EU is looking at in terms of the disproportionate or proportionate reaction that apple had? are we expecting to see more of these sorts of um, these challenges when it comes to the App Store and Apple trying to maintain its dominance while still trying to stay within the rules here? yeah, I mean, look, you know, uh, when it comes to uh the $2 billion dollar that they they were fined from the EU over uh Apple music and uh Spotify, Apple says that they're going to appeal that, and so you know, clearly they're not going to just take this line down there're. they're going to continue to try to, I guess, work through what the EU rules are, but uh to the Limit, right, and so that appears to be what they're what they're intent on doing. they don't want to give up uh making money off of the App Store the way they do now through through uh commissions from developers when there's sales of their products, uh or or apps themselves, and so you, you got to imagine that they're going to to continue to try to to fight this as much as they can, while still sticking to the law.",[1]
164,-bNfUt5kLFE,How Starbucks turned fast coffee into a $36 billion business,Yahoo Finance,2024-03-09 21:00:00+00:00,"[Music]: Frappuccino, latte, cold brw, Refreshers and much more. with over 35,000 stores in 80 different countries, Starbucks has created this perception of being an affordable luxury for the past 40 years. in 2023 alone, the coffee chain generated almost $36 billion in Revenue. but what are some of the achievements that led to such success? beyond the ticker, takes a deep dive into the company's history. Starbucks was founded in 1971 by Jerry Baldwin, Zev zagel and Gordon balker at Seattle's Pike Place Market. the first Starbucks store was located in Seattle at 2000 Western Avenue from 1971 to 1976. then it moved to its first official location, 1912 Pike Place. in 1987 the three founders were ready to sell the Starbucks brand. that's when Howard Schultz, who was actually their former head head of marketing, returned to acquire the company after he had left to create his own booming Cafe business, IL joural. fast. for to June 1992, Schultz took the company public with a portfolio of 140 stores, a revenue of 73.5 million and a market value of 271 Million. by September 1992, Starbucks share price jumped nearly 40% since its IPO. in 2003, Starbucks acquired its Hometown rival coffee business Seattle's Best Coffee and Tor fion Italia from AFC Enterprises for $72 million to help expand its footprint. but the business wasn't always buzzing. 5 years later, Starbucks faced its weakest quarter as a public company, as us consumers pulled back commit economic troubles leading to the closure of 600 underperforming stores and cutting back us expansion plans. in March 2020, Starbucks closed Cafe only stores in the US for 2 weeks due to the covid-19 pandemic. covid-19 lockdowns caused Starbucks to suffer a general 10% sales decrease and a 50% decline in sales in China. in October 2022, Starbucks named luxman noris Simmon as interm CEO before he took over the helm from Schultz in late March 2023, marking the end of Schultz third and what is expected to be his final tenure: a CEO and so, from a single store to the international coffee Powerhouse that it is today, with Innovation at its core, the momentum is there as Starbucks aims to ramp up its locations [Music] internationally.",[88]
165,KE6rfkyuySQ,How Fox stands to benefit from new sports streaming venture,Yahoo Finance,2024-02-25 01:00:13+00:00,"sharers of fox scoring an upgrade today thanks to optimism on the entertainment company's planned sports streaming bundle with Warner Brothers Discovery in Disney's ESPN. joining us now is the analyst behind that. call Jason basne, city city managing director, Jason, always good to have you on the show. so you, you upgrade Fox to a buy Jason. your target goes to 35. how come Jason walk? walk us through the argument. well, there's a lot of skepticism about the efficacy of this Sports bundle on two fronts. one is a lot of investors don't believe that consumers are going to buy it because it only contains about half of the sports rights. and the second reason is they fear that a lot of people will buy it but they're going to spin down from their big fat payv package to something, um, that's cheaper and thinner and that's going to hurt Fox. that's why Fox traded down on the news. our thesis is pretty simple: um, a lot of people are going to buy this and it's actually going to bring in cord cutters, cord Nevers that have never had a PTV subscription and it's actually going to be positive for stock, for the stock. and is it going to benefit Fox more than the other members of The Venture? it will. I'll tell you the ratio? the ratio that we look at is: if you look at a media company, how much are their affiliate fees are they getting from Sports versus how much are they getting from non-sports? the more you get from Sports, um, the simpler that ratio is for you to digest. so in the case of fox, they could have two and a half people spin down from a big fat bundle to this Sports JV for every new person that signs up. if you look at someone like Warner, it's almost one for one um. so it definitely benefits firms like Fox and Disney much more than it does Warner and certainly more than people that aren't in the JV and Jason. what's your best guess about what the the price of this service would be? you know some of the the reports I've seen- I'm sure you've seen the same ones- maybe 40 to 50 per month. it sounds kind of pricey, but what do you think? well, I just added up all the affiliate fees that they're getting today, um that are for those linear channels that are going in the bundle um, and then marked it up 35% and I came up with a $36 price point. so I think you could see something in the $35 range early on. maybe it goes to 40. um, I don't think it gets to 50. what's interesting is if you, if you took what we think this bundle will, will, will cost and you bought a Paramount and peacock on top of it, that would get you in the $50 range, but then you'd have 85% of all sports. um, if you include Amazon in that, you'd have 90%. so you're you're essentially talking about every piece of sports content for really something that I think will cost 52 bucks a month. Jason, I want to move on to one of the other members of the joint venture, Warner Brothers Discovery. the stock trading at a record low after it reported, uh, disappointing numbers, or numbers that at least disappointed most of the street. I believe you still have a buy rating on the stock. um, what's going to get it to go up? here? we do still have a buy rate, ating, and our thesis was pretty simple. it was just that the, the amount of free cash flow that they would generate, they would use it to pay down debt and essentially, you're, your debt would become Equity. but even if your Enterprise Value didn't change, um, what ended up happening today- and it's happened for a couple quarters in a row- is the ebit dog keeps missing Street estimates and what? what's essentially happening is the pressures on the linear ecosystem are just uh occurring faster than the improvements they're making on the streaming side. it's pretty much that simple, and, Jason, so you have a Buy on it. but what are the sort of the kind of downside RIS you would flag Jason? well, more rapid cord cutting, you know, weaker viewership on linear television, um, and then on the other side of the Ledger, the thing that you know, most of the myth that they had in this quarter, um was really at the studio, um, that's a little bit of an Aftershock of uh the strike and that will persist, I think, probably at least in the first quarter, maybe even the second quarter of this year, and then things should get back to normal where Studio begins to perform better. Jason, always love having you on the show. thanks so much for taking the time to chat with us. have a great weekend. you bet, you bet you too.","[418, 420]"

Boeing recently made headlines again bringing the question of air safety back to the four. then there are regular concerns for the sector, from geopolitical instability to the level of demand from the world's second biggest economy. there are bright spots amid the risk, of course. some major airports are upgrading and the expectations for demand seem to only climb higher. so how are you spending, where are you going and how does the sector perform from here? Yahoo finances travel guide 2024- industry insides has your captain speaking and asking the question: what's next for [Music] Airlines? what is next? indeed, we're going into the three things that consumers should be watching: ing in the airline space this year, joining now as part of Yahoo finances travel guide 2024- industry insights, our very own Pro supermania pross. we've got some more bad news for Boeing yesterday. we we don't have it, but we got it from them. you know the topic on everyone's mind is Boeing. right, the new fa report on Boeing safety culture came out and they said- quote: they found gaps in Boeing safety journey and described the safety culture as inadequate and confusing. uh, not all employees understood the reporting uh process for for for reporting problems, uh, there was retaliation for workers who spoke up in some instances. so, and and this report was actually written before the Alaska Airlines blowout, so it sort of kind of indicating there's still more issues that Boeing needs to deal with, uh more work to do in the future for them. prob. a lot of concern about a Boeing planes being grounded for some time is how that's going to impact, uh, the supply that's out there, how that could ultimately impact airfare prices. what have we seen so far and and what are we expecting to see as we head into the very busy travel season? yeah, you know, when some of those 787 7, 737 Max 9s were were grounded, we saw some disruptions there and some travel issues there and then probably some price Heights cuz PL taken off out of Supply. but uh, according to Hopper, uh, they're seeing that fairs are actually for the spring travel boom- down 2% compared to last year and a whopping 11% compared to 2019 pre-pandemic levels. uh, for European Long Haul flights- down 7% compared to last year and 8% compared to prepandemic- and they think that in the next 6 months, domestic flights will stay below 2023 Trends uh and also below the pre pandemic kind of high there. so good news for travelers there. from a air Fair Point of View and one of the other things that we've heard from CEOs, this earning season on the airline front is about the international travel demand that they're seeing right now and specifically China's travel rebound. can we expect that to pick up this year? you know they were later than most other uh countries in opening up and returning to travel uh and many in the travel industry expecting a China boom to launch that and and we're seeing that Chinese authorities anticipate air travel to recover there. HSBC, in a note about Asia, said that China's China's outbound travel uh to Southeast Asia is booming because there's Visa free travel there. that's helping there. despite macro headwinds, they say we believe Chinese citizens will still be willing to spend on travel related experiences. also.

Buffett gets credit. Buffett, among are both- you know when, when he was still with the firm- got credit over the years for being very, very disciplined, especially when it looks to acquisitions. back at the past 5 years, they were generating around 255 billion a year in free cash flow. I think we'll probably see more on the stock investment front. then we will outright Acquisitions. you know they've made a commitment to the Japanese firms not to buy more than 10% of their companies. I think it's just been harder and harder for them to find things that are of value. that would really sort of move the needle and- and I think that that's going to be the complicated thing for them going forward-",[6]

Enterprise comparable sales declined 4.8% during the quarter. that's compared to estimates of 5.3% of a decline, the retailer also increasing its quarterly dividend. overall, the business Outlook anticipates industry sales stabilization this year. here with more, we've got sea Dunlop, who is the Morning Star Equity analyst here. Sean, thanks so much for taking some time here this morning. first and foremost want to get your readin on the report and in the worst is behind Best Buy, yeah, I would say pretty, pretty decent earnings. all in it was 14.65 billion in sales, which which edged facts that consensus. adjusted earnings per share were $2.70. that's obviously better than consensus, better than our own estimate. I think more importantly is, as we look forward, the firm had the confidence to raise its dividend. that looked safe, uh and and negative 3% to Flat. comparable store sales for the year to come is positive, with a $169 million restructuring, uh, The Firm is looking at flat operating income margin for the year to come, which is quite a bit better than, uh, we'd expected and certainly better than you wouldd expect, given the sales environment that the firm still finds itself in. so, on balance, looks like we're starting to hit some of those replacement Cycles from the co pull forward could be that we're we're through the worst of this patch for Best Buy. so if we're through the worst of the patch, and then when do you expect to see a return to growth? is that something that you see playing out before the end of the year? yeah, I think so. so during the first two quarters i' would expect that we would see negative Parable Store sales. The Firm obviously continues to close stores at sort of a 1 to 2% annual clip. they plan to close another 10 to 15 this year. I think as we move into the back half of the Year, Q3 is where we're starting to pencil in real growth year-over-year for Best Buy and Q4. if we teased out the impact they had an extra week in this last year's Q4, but if you teased that out, we would expect growth for the year to come. where in the key categories that that you're tracking are going to really prove that Best Buy can get back to some of it, its golden days, if, if you will, because appliances that still got hit hard in this most recent quarter, uh, and we're still looking across where the consumer environment actually leads some of the spending back into the categories that were distressed, at least in this most recent uh Q4 here, yeah, it's a great question. I think we're going to continue to see pressure in categories like appliances and home theater. those have longer replacement Cycles, so if people bought those in 2020 or 20121 they're not going to need to replace them in the near term. here the other factors: obviously we've seen quite a bit of a Slowdown in the housing market. there's natural, natural replacement that occurs with that. so I think we'll probably see it first with laptops: the. the good news is we're starting to see that now. best bited positive unit volume over the most recent quarter uh with within their sales base and there really wasn't a refresh. there weren't any new features, there wasn't much Innovation that would drive an upgrade cycle, which means that that could be rid into as just being a natural replacement cycle. so I think we'd see it in laptops first. I think, as we move forward, we'll start to see it in phones and then it'll spill over in some the other categories over time. Sean, are we seeing an inflection point when it comes to laptops and PCs? I, I think so. yeah, I certainly think we'll see it as we move through the first half of this year and into the second half of of calendar 2024. I think that's where we're really going to see it. obviously, consumer electronics are a little bit unique, categorically so. if I'm a consumer and I have a phone and I've owned it for three years, I I can pretty comfortably defer an upgrade for another year if I need to, if macroeconomic pressure remains Stout, and the trouble from an industry perspective is that you don't get that sale back uh the way that you in some other categories. so if consumers continue to feel pressured, they can defer some of these replacement Cycles. I I think we will start to see it. we're seeing an increase in in real hourly earnings across the board. obviously there's some room to go in terms of recovering uh savings rates. home starts are obviously slow. interest rates remain high. evolving credit balances remain high, but we are cautiously optimistic about the health of the consumer as we move into the balance of the year. and then, just lastly, while we have you here, Sean, I mean we think about the, the year of stabilization, year of sales stab ization that the company is banking on here. what? what does that look like in terms of what investors should expect for the stock price continued trajectory. yeah, I mean, I think, uh, given the Market's move today, obviously the the stock is up five to six percent. that brings us into a range that we'd consider fairly valued. so, as you think about it from the perspective of investors, you're looking at roughly a 5% dividend yield. you're looking at, uh, repurchases- uh, I think $350 million of repurchases in the year to come. that's probably what you're looking at in terms of total shareholder return. you're not going to see tons in the way of capital appreciation for the year to come. that that would probably be how I would encourage investors to think about it. morning Stars, Sean Dunlop. thanks so much for taking the time here today.

I think it's really promising. so, uh, as the doic data said, uh, m&a activity is up January and February and there's two places where that's probably a continuation of what we saw last quarter in 2023, and a few places that's some new energy. so, uh, Tech is is new- see, see some big Tech deals- is really encouraging. that's a place that has been down dramatically for the past couple of years. the other um place that is encouraging is seeing a little bit more financial sponsor activi. so private Equity Investments, which has um had been taking a a hit over the past year as well. suzan, what are you seeing just in terms of valuation, because we were talking about the fact earlier this week, obviously with Capital One discover really leveling up the valuation playing field that we have seen when you compared to some of the uh deals last year, what does that tell us just in terms of where we are in that cycle and some of the recovery maybe that we could expect? um, yeah, it, it is hopeful. I mean, the story of last year was that disconnect on buyer seller valuation Gap as interest rates Rose, there was some kind of confusion and resetting of what is the right price expectation, and so we've been waiting to see how that that Log Jam um how that backlog will start to to um get unlocked and you know when we start to see dat uh deals like this come to the market. now there's a new Mark and we can um buyers and sellers can kind of get to a closer place. what is the hottest sector that investors should be watching for deal making activity this year too? again, I think the the the places we've seen deal activity, including energy, um a lot of oil and gas, um consolidation still to come. uh, healthc care will continue to be an important part of the, the m&a um market, and then, as the, those would be the two places where we've seen a lot of energ um sorry m&a activity and we should continue to um given underlying industry Dynamics and the need for growth in those places. how much is writing on the fed's ability and really the fact that they are going to follow through with Ray cuts and we talk about? there's so much focus on that timing of the first Ray cut, but when we talk about the impact that that is ultimately going to have on Deal flow, how much of that really revolves obviously around the pace of those future cuts for strategic deal making led by corporates. I think the the current interest rate environment is largely baked in. so hire for longer is a comfortable place- at least it's an an understood Place- uh for leverage deal making. so on the private Equity side, uh Venture Capital, they're going to be more sensitive to seeing the specific timing and um size of those rate Cuts. uh. so for the Strategic m&a Market. I think that's why we are starting to see pickup and deal activity as uh Executives get comfortable with the, the cost of capital today. how much will investors do you believe, scrutinize the deal making. that does come forward here. I mean, we think even, uh, in some of the deals that got announced last year that investors were really really uh kind of sensitive to where companies were putting that Capital to work and the companies that they were going after and inquiring as well. there's quite a difference between what happens at deal announcement and then when we do studies of value creation over time related to m&a activity. um, I would encourage investors to be looking at the longer term perspective. so if you take a 10-year perspective and you look at, is a company doing at least a deal a year? so that puts that in in what we call a frequent acquire category. they're going to outperform in the long run and so, looking beyond the specific um large deal announcement and the overall m&a activity would be key. the regulation aspect: yes, we haven't brought that up yet. when it comes to the action that we've seen from the FTC, when it comes to the scrutiny that we've seen from the Biden Administration, how do you see that? or, within your conversations, to the extent that you can share, how our companies, how are potential dealmakers, think about that and how do you think that is ultimately helping to guide some of those decisions. when it comes to acquisition, this has been building for years. uh, and I would say, even versus this time last year, we've moved more into a situation of kind of the Known Unknown. so the the landscape is a bit clearer in terms of what kind of actions the FTC or the doj may be taking, and that allows Executives to look at their m&a road map and really consider where. what might we see regulatory scrutiny add that lens to their potential deal Pipeline and you know, if there is the, the conviction and the Strategic need to pursue a deal, you can start to take that into consideration. so it it's stying deal making on some levels. there's going to be certain deals you just don't consider um, and then for the small number of deals to get regulatory scrutiny, you need to to factor that in. all right, suzan Kumar, great to have you here in studio with us being company's Global m&a practice of Vice President. thanks so much. thank you.",[207]

Brian, it's good to see you here. so what do you make of this massive move higher that? we saw a lot of that on the back of the nvidia's blowout quarter last week? are we set up to maybe see a bit of a correction here on the horizon? yeah, thanks for having me. we think that actually we might be set up for a bit of a pullback in some of the high flyer names, but not necessarily anything all that broad or all that deep. and when we look at last March, right, it was Nvidia to the rescue in terms of the AI story, The Tech story and the rally from there, and once again it was the Nidia earnings that really helped kind of turn sentiment around end of December. things were looking really good. January is beginning to look a little bit uh chilly for the markets, and then things turned around when we realized that, you know, maybe this whole AI thing does have some legs, but uh, uh, maybe some of the names have been pulled along in the wake of Nvidia that perhaps shouldn't be, and so we could maybe see a little bit more sifting and winnowing in the markets over the next few weeks. what? what is the profile of the companies that you would believe are perhaps positioned to fall off of the Nvidia cailes then? yeah, so a lot of it would really have to do with those who claim to be related to AI but are only so in name, and I think that's something that you often times see is think about, uh, when Bitcoin was on one of its many runs higher, you know, before its precipitous Falls, uh, that a lot of companies were talking about blockchain, uh, talking about issuing their own coins, and so, when we were actually going through on our investment committee looking at those word clouds that you can do, uh, for earnings transcripts, artificial intelligence began popping up quite often, but then, when you look at the companies that are actually talking about it, not all of them are actually using it. it seems like, you know, maybe they're just trying to say that they're being very fashionable. so we would just urge caution with a lot of investors that if somebody claims that they are using AI or that they stand the benefit from it, really dig into the details and find out if there's any substance there behind the words. Brian, I also want to bring up what we heard from Berkshire hathway over the weekend. they have a record set of cashier: 167.5 billion. you warm Buffett warning that there's not many deals out there, that there's no possibility of another eye popping performance. is this? I'm curious how you take that into account when you're thinking about what this next several months, couple of years could look like. those words from Warren Buffett: is that a warning, do you think, to the market? well, yes, I think it's a warning for the bigger cap companies, because for a company like Burk hathway, for them to have something that's going to move the needle, some sort of transformational deal, it's going to have to be very big. they're either going to have to have a large deal or a large number of deals, and so for us it actually seems like maybe more of those transformational deals are going to be more lower cap. so think about midcap and small cap companies. so for a company like Burkshire hathway, where they have what is it like? $140 billion do in cash, it would take quite a large deal to actually improve their return on investment for the next quarter. but if you consider a smaller or midcap company where they don't have, you know, billions in cash, where it might be Millions instead, some of these deals can be very transformational, very impactful on their businesses.

PR suenan has the details. I can't, I can't help laugh my way through that intro. it's coming now. it's coming now. pross, really, is it really coming? I don't, I mean like that's little crous says it is. but, and just to rewind a little bit, 2017, right, this is what 5 years ago we heard. we saw this thing roll out at a, at a, at an event, um, and then haven't heard much since, until 2022. when musk said at the Giga Rodeo, when they opened up the Austin Factory, that it's coming, uh, it's going to come in 2023. right, and they reopen reservations whole and we'll talk about that. but basically now we see, must tweeting late last night, it is coming, they've, they've, they. basically, production design is complete. uh, they're going to unveil the car later this year, like you said, Josh, and then planning for sales next year. now says again: a0o to 60 time less than a second. kind of insane stuff here. but again, we heard this last. we heard this two years ago. we heard it five years ago. is it actually going to come out? um, deposit holders, some had put down $50,000. yeah, um, no interest. right, that's refundable.

I mean, this reminds me of the Cyber truck a little bit as well, which, as which did. well, it sort of come out. yeah, yeah, that eventually right, right, yeah, um, it's interesting timing because, of course, byd came out with its own Supercar um, earlier this week. is that a coincidence that we're now getting an update on the Roadster? this I wrote a piece on. it's going to come out just just in the next few moments. but basically, yes, I kind of allude to the fact that it's interesting that these tweets came out late. last night only we talked about byd's u9 uh super car. right, it's going to cost $230,000- around the same price as, potentially, the Tesla Roadster. uh, scissor doors, four Motors, all this, all these, all these pretty cool stats. but only a couple months ago, Neo also said that their ep9 hypercar was going to cost 3 million us. uh, 1,000 horsepower, interchangeable batteries, all this sort of stuff. these, the Chinese Supercar makers are, are sort of coming on strong here and it seems like maybe musk kind of had to cough up more details cuz he felt the need to, cuz these are these. these cars are going to come on the road later this year. the Chinese car. so uh, in China, but not necessarily uh in the US, but still competition nonetheless. right, if you're a Chinese buyer, are you going to wait for the Tesla Roadster? are you going to buy one of these other ones? I want to quickly just say something real quick: um, yes, it is a $5,000 deposit, not a $50,000 deposit, for, oh, that's a lot lower. yeah, but still, it's one to corre. It's not nothing, I mean it's. it's interesting probably because, listen, I I think that's a beautiful car. the lines on that car are are beautiful to me, but I, I would say, like 200,000, when you find yourself competing with, like a Lamborghini Ferrari, that's a small Market. I mean, ultimately that doesn't move the needle for Tesla or the EV market, right? I mean, what have we talked about so much on the show? what's one way to reignite growth here? it's not the 200,000 car and again, gorgeous car, but ultimately you need lower price TVs, right? yeah, I think this. these are just Halo cars that bring people in, like you know, they have. they have the Optimus robot in some some stores to kind of bring people in, same with the Cyber trucks in a lot of the Marquee Tesla stores to bring people in. so that's like so the thing that kind of draws you. you're going to buy the, the model y or the model 3, maybe the x or or the S, as your actual car. quickly, I want to re again clarify that it's a $5,000 deposit, but then within 10 days, you got a C cougher- 45,000 for a full, for a 50,000. so it is effectively a $50,000 deposit car that people have put down. yes, and. and the car when it came, when it- when 2017 it was- it was said to be a $200,000 MSRP and 250k for that Founders Edition. sorry about that. want to get that clear. that's okay, we'll see. I mean, there's it's not even out yet. so there's a lot of there's a lot of confusion, I guess. yeah, why do we care? right, it doesn't matter, it's going to change tomorrow. who knows? right, we'll see. tweet.",[11]

I know Charlie Munger hated Bitcoin and Mr Buffett's called it rap poison, but I have typically found that people that are not focusing on it and are not doing the Deep dive homework feel that way. uh, but after you do the homework on it, you sort of fall into the rabbit hole of Bitcoin and it's a one-way ticket towards Bitcoin.

176,dT6yRDhpU_k,Nevada AG discusses why the FTC is suing to block Kroger acquisition of Albertsons,Yahoo Finance,2024-02-28 21:02:49+00:00,"the Federal Trade Commission and a coalition of Attorneys General are suing to block Kroger's $25 billion acquisition of Alberton. nine states currently scrutinizing the grocery stores Mega merger. now among them is Nevada attorney general, Aon Ford, who believes that the deal would create an anti-competitive Marketplace. we want to bring him in now. Aon for is Nevada's attorney general. attorney general, thanks so much for taking the time to speak with us here this morning. clearly you're looking to challenge this suit. I'm curious as to why you don't support this deal. why do you see this as a risk here to Consumers? well, first off, thanks so much for having me on to have this important conversation. uh, but to your question, this is an example of where there was a major Confluence between the data that we analyzed, the legal research that we did and the community input that we received, and it all aligned and led us to the conclusion that opposing this merger was going to be appropriate for a number of reasons. U listening to our constituents, we learned um through my Bureau of SCH protection, through the D? doens of community, um engagement sessions that we had with chair con actually from the FTC actually visiting three of those with me. we learned about concerns about higher prices for groceries, um, concerns about stores that would be closing, and concerns about employee wages and benefits, and again, those were um repeated through the data that we did and the legal analysis that we did. that determined that, in fact, there were big concerns around competition in those areas, and so that's largely the reason why we've decided to join this B and coalition to oppose this merger. there there has been push back, obviously, from the two parties that are involved, but, even more broadly speaking, from industry experts or former FDC members that are saying that, hey, when you look at the competition from Walmart, you look at the competition from Amazon, the fact that you have two giants within this space, that if this deal is not approved, it's going to give them even more power. I'm curious how, then, you see that as being okay or maybe not having that big of an issue with it, when you compare that to what could play out with more pricing, uh, competition, well, it's a lot part that you just mentioned that gave rise to this lawsuit. I mean, at the end of the day, we think that the competition that currently exists between Kroger and Alberton, uh, in terms of groceries, for example, in terms of the farmacy services, for example, and in terms of the labor market, uh, those far outweigh U the the counterveiling issues that were raised by the parts who are seeking to enter into this merger. we've seen price competition as a good thing, as between Kroger and our. that will go away in a merger. we've seen the promotion of pricing discounts, uh. we've seen product quality competition between these two entities, uh, uh, and again, that would all go away, as would the store condition competition and customer service competition, and that's just in the grocery context. we're not even touching on the pharmacy context. uh, in the labor market, and so, you know, we see those again as as very real issues that we have to uh stand up against and try to protect our, our relevant constituencies from. if this deal was to go through is. is it, is it clear from your assessment what type of food desert uh situation this would also add on to or layer on to uh, not just within Nevada, but within a lot of regions within the country. well, let me actually back up just for a second and want to, you know, suggest that you to um, when you come to our state- I don't want you to get price, you know, upcharged- you have to say Nevada, our state, Nevada. look, I made. if you get upcharged, you can't call me. that's not price G. I thought about that right after I said it. to look, last time I was in Las Vegas. they let it slide, because there's a lot of other things they let slide in my but but but to to your point. that's a very great question and that's a very real issue. food deserts are already prevalent in our um um State here and in fact I went out to a rural area called parump and was advised- and I'm glad we went out there and talked to the constituents there, because they they reminded us that they're rural, but we have Frontier in Nevada as well that drives to rural areas 100 miles every month or so to do their shopping, and if one of those stores is affected, then that those, those Frontier areas, are likewise affected, and so certainly food deserts is a concern that also um piqued its head and piqu my interest. um and um supported my decision here to join this litigation. I'm curious, uh, attorney general, Beyond- and you mentioned the conversations that you're having with uh Nadin within your state- what are you hearing just in terms of how much pressure they are still under, given the fact that inflation remains, uh, well above that 2% Target that we have for the fed and? and how optim are they at all optimistic about some of the progress that has been made, uh, in the fed's fight against inflation? well, I think I have two answers to that. the first, and I'm G take the Lou one first. I mean they, they are happy, obviously, that that, that we're seeing some fluctuations and in some, in some areas, a decrease in pricing. that um makes it more affordable for some homes. but as a general matter, um, people are quite Disturbed with the, the pricing of of groceries, right, uh, and again, that speaks specifically and directly to the comp, the competition that Koger and alberon currently have, and and if they merge, um, the concern is that those prices will continue to go up. and we- I have heard from so many constituents we we met with again in person at least a dozen meetings, but we got had over a thousand online responses to our survey, uh, which obviously are confidential, but um, the, the, the Crux of those were exactly the same. people were concerned about the pricing of groceries, uh, and and um overwhelming opposed to what we, what's being proposed here, what? what was the largest finding from that service you mentioned was confidential, but I I wonder if there's one thing that could really steer the decisionmaking, both from the FTC as well as from the team of attorney generals that have Sally come together to really Spotlight this deal and and at least give some direct feedback that results in looking and taking a second look at this tie up. yeah, listen, I think, um, it's fair to say that the concerns we received in those surveys echoed what we had already heard in the in in the open sessions, uh, and what is already detailed in our redacted complaint: concerns about the high, the higher prices for groceries, concerns about stores that were closed, labor concerns, concerns about wages and benefits. uh, some of these places have pharmacies in them and, and um, the the problem that could be caused if these stores merge, uh, in certain opportunities to get prescriptions, refill, would, would, would, would go away. um, some of even have gas stations at them, and so we heard a few concerns about what would happen in that regard. um, and so those, those were again um, concerns that were echoed and other aspects of our investigation, um, and that's, you know, again, that gives us great concern.",[217]

181,SmC3LtmRDng,M&A boom in 2024 won't just be 'one-year catchup': Strategist,Yahoo Finance,2024-03-07 18:30:30+00:00,"deal making is expected to show new Signs of Life this year, Morgan Stanley making the call that m&a activity is set to rebound not only in 2024 but in years to come. for more on the m&a comeback, we've got Andrew sheets, who's the Morgan Stanley Chief cross cross asset strategist. Andrew, great to have you here on with us on Yahoo finance today. first and foremost, what? what is really kind of the invigoration behind this and the m&a forecast? yeah, great, it's, it's great to be here. so I, I, I think there are both cyclical and structural drivers that are going on here. you know, if we think just about, you know, rebounding from last year, deal making activity in 2023 was exceptionally low, you know, relative to the size of the economy- maybe the lowest that we've seen in 30 years- and so there's some important catch up, as I think we see from markets increased confidence in a soft landing and a better economic outcome. that's going to catch up to corporate boardrooms. but there's also a longer term picture here that's quite exciting. there's activity that we think private Equity players need to do. there are other forces that we think will be making up for multi-year deficits and there's some interesting Regional Trends. so this isn't just about a one-year catchup. we also think this is a longer term story, Andrew. if we don't see the FED, though, cut rates before the end of the year, how much is that going to then delay the recovery that you're expecting? so I think it really depends on on what is the economic environment behind that delay. you know, I think if the FED is not cutting rates this year because the economy is even stronger than expected, I think that could peacefully coexist with- uh, more m&a activity as corporates get increasingly confident about the economic backdrop, as fears of recession recede even further. and then, importantly, you- we do think many private Equity investors- you know the average kind of amount of time their portfolio companies have been on their books remains historically high- that they will kind of face pressure to act, kind of regardless of what the FED is doing. so I think it can still survive that sort of a scenario. now, if, if inflation's high- and that's the reason why the FED has not been cutting rates- that could be a bigger challenge. but I think if the FED isn't cutting because growth is better than expected, we'd still think m&a recovers for investors out there that are trying to pick and choose or get ahead of some of the biggest m&a opportunities. where are the sector hotpots that they should be perhaps keeping a close eye on? so I I think there are a couple of places. I think they The Usual Suspects like healthc care and Technology. real estate's an interesting one and and that's also a sector where our analysts see lower regulatory hurdles to m&a than other sectors. and you know, as part of our work we really leaned heavily on Morgan Stanley's Global team of of equity analysts to really kind of dig into a lot of these themes. and there's some really interesting Regional stories as well. we think m&a, which has been in a huge almost decade long drought in Europe, is picking up in a big way. that's actually the region where Morgan Stanley Equity analysts are most optimistic on more M m&a activity versus consensus. so I I think that could be one of these factors where sentiment on Europe is certainly lower than other regions but where m&a activity I think is more likely to surprise positively, Andrew, the push back that we've seen on the regulatory side, the Crackdown on antitrust- is that at all going to have more of a freeze or maybe chilling effect on the m&a pipeline? so I think that is a really important factor to to flag. I think that's one of the risks to this rebound. but when we sit down with our our our analysts and we, we think through these issues. those regulatory forces, first, I think, differ some by depending on what sector that we're looking at. two, I think, when we ask our analysts holistically to think about the risks, even factoring in the regulatory risks, 50% of our industry teams globally still see m&a increasing. and then also we think that this is an area where, you know, under either of the likely presidential outcomes, we think companies could ultimately get more comfortable activity. we, the companies have now seen have a more experience with the Biden Administration and their approach to m&a. uh, there would have been previous experience with the Trump administration's approach to m&a, so these might be bumps, but we don't see regulation as a major impediment to this multi-year rebound.",[207]

Michael, great to see you, as always, thank you for joining us. so really strong positive reaction to What Target had to say. and if I unpack this quarter, Michael, I see sales down- comparable sales down, 4.4%, but I see margins up. I see a big earnings beat. do you think the street is underestimating how serious Target is about taking costs out of its business to improve margins? well, thanks for having me, Brian. and maybe starting with that fourth quarter, and you hit a couple of these points. but to me the headlines are first, you know, if you add Q4 to the progress the teams made this year on profit, which was an important goal for us heading into the year, growing operating income by nearly $2 billion doll this year is a great step forward on on a line where we had some work to do after last year. but importantly, what we're talking about and what we'll share today is our excitement for the growth in the year to come and even within our fourth quarter where, to be clear, we're not satisfied with the Top Line. we won't be satisfied until we see strong, positive comps. that's what we expect to deliver in 2024. but within the fourth quarter we saw some sequential Improvement. we saw traffic being relatively stronger than it was earlier in the year. we saw a step forward in our digital business and, importantly, we saw a nice step forward in our discretionary categories. so we're excited to build on that into next year. and the way we drive value over time is with a strong Topline and great profit performance and we're excited to pair those two things in 2024. I Target pulled out what $500 million in costs from his business last year. how much costs are there left to pull out of the Target Model? one of the things we're excited about if you look back over the last several years is we grew faster than we ever intended in the first couple years. the pandemic and that scale- going from a 70 some billion dollar retailer to an over hundred billion doll ret retailer- brings so many opportunities to take that higher volume and find ways to take out waste, do things more simply and that's what the teams have been hard at work at. that half a billion dollars in efficiency work this year is a credit to the teams getting after that work in a real way and and it paying off and we think there's more Runway there. and another example of where productivity comes from is great inventory management, and we've really seen that this year, with inventories materially down year-over-year- important- we had some work to do there after last year but importantly, our inst stocks are as strong as they've been in years right now and that to for lower inventories, better in stocks, so much productivity comes with that. our stores are more efficient when their back rooms aren't full. our DCS can be more efficient when they're able to manage just the right amount of product and our teams have done a wonderful job managing a great inventory position this year. you mentioned that the traffic started to come back. what do you attribute that to? I think it's a handful of things, and you know a lot of what I'm excited about in the business. that we'll do even more of next year. I think contributes. you know there's some things that have worked really well for us for a while: a strong drive up business double digit growth and drive up in Q4 double digit growth and drive up for the year. that's clearly a way to shop that consumers have fallen in love with and you know we don't just take that for granted. we work every day to make it better and so this was the first quarter where we had both a full quarter of- we can bring a Starbucks out with your drive up order, you can do returns via Drive up- and the guest response to those Services have been great. when does Target get back to growth mode for comparable sales? is that a spring break quarter type thing or we're talking- we're having this conversation- for the holiday season in the second half and that's when Target starts growing sales again. yeah, well, in aggregate for next year we expect to grow. we've got into a sales decline in q1, but I would expect in Q2, three and four we're returning to growth and you would still be able to. so the target- I just want to get back to the cost. is the Target still two billion in cost out? yes, uh, we've said in efficiency work over time we expect 2 to three billion of sustained efficiency improvement from that work and we got a great down payment on that progress with a half a billion dollars this year and again, the theme of that efficiency work- so much of it goes back to growth in two ways. it's the growth we've seen that opens up the efficiency opportunities and when we do that right, that gives us the fuel to invest in all the things that drive our growth going forward. we're excited for the Investments we'll continue to make in the business. you've heard me say in past conversations, Brian, you know those Investments we make in our team are some of the most important Investments we make as a business. they're high returning Investments that we know work as hard for us as anything else we do. we'll invest in new stores, we'll invest in remodels. you'll see us bring more ultas to the market next year and those investments in growth have served us well over time and we think will in 2024. the last time I talked to you, Michael, inflation was still. it was still hot, it was accelerating, but not the same rates as it was during the highight of the pandemic. and then, you know, in the early part of last year, with deflation now sitting in in a lot of product categories, are consumers putting that extra item in their basket? is that what's driving some of the traffic Improvement? well, if we let step back and look at the consumer, over the last couple of years inflation has certainly been stubbornly high and we know the impact that that's had on American families. if you're shopping for your grocery run and your food and beverage products cost 20 to 30% more than they did just a couple of years ago, you know that's a real pain point for the American Consumer. you add that to higher interest rates and you know we're excited to see inflation start to normalize. we think that's a good thing for the consumer, a consumer that's been remarkably resilient against that tough backdrop and, you know, with our within our business, I think we see some signs of that rebalancing of the consumer spending portfolio with the Improvement we saw in our discretionary categories in Q4. what has also been resilient, uh, Michael, it's the big box retail Model, A lot of retailers that you compete with and some I'll call it like a Home Depot. they're back to opening stores. uh, at a rate that I think are is really come, really is coming as a surprise to many investors. how many stores will you open this year and will they be in that super center or that large format model? now, we'll share more about that this morning, but we get really excited about our prospects of opening stores. we open 21 new targets this year and to bring a new Target to a market that didn't have one before, and the best response we see- uh, that's work. we get excited about wearing my CFO hat. the Returns on those projects look as strong as ever and you will see us mix more to some of those big box stores where we can bring the entire Target experience to a new market. uh, also, Target supposed to announce some form of membership program. what can you share on that front? well, more to come in our in our remarks this morning on some of the specifics, but what I can say is we start with a great Foundation. our Target Circle program, with a 100 million members, has been really valued as a loyalty program by those that participate in it. that kind of free to join, Great Value brought by Target Circle every day is a fantastic base. but, like always, we're listening to the consumer to find ways we can make it better, we can make it easier, we can provide even more value, and so we'll share more today about what our plans look like to take that great starting program and and make it even better. I imagine what, uh, after you announce this program, Michael, comparison is going to be right to to Amazon Prime. how far does Target want to push this? does it want to get into content? does it want to get into cloud services? what is targets Lane and how serious you are about taking that Amazon Prime member away. well, like all things, we're listening to our consumers. how can we make their shopping experience even better? better, how can we make them fall more in love with Target, with the products we sell, with our owned and National brands, with the ways to shop that make getting those products easy? and so you know that's, that's what you can expect us to pay attention to. you know, we've seen, like I said, a great response to some of those easy ways to shop, like drive up. we think we have a real opportunity to capitalize on a strong foundation and our shipped will shop the store and bring it straight to your doorstep that same day offering, and we think there's Runway to grow that offering too real. quickly, Michael, Before I Let You Go, what is it like to go from CFO to coo and how are you spending your days differently? well, right now I'm wearing both hats and they're both hats that I. I hope they're paying you double, Michael. I hope they really have doubled your paycheck, the thing that I'm excited about, and you know my- my finance team would tell you this is true- is nothing fills my cup more than spending time with our teams in the field, in our stores and our distribution centers. and so as I step into, you know, working with the operations team even more, it's a chance to get to do that, day in and day out, even more than I have in the CFO role, and I couldn't be more honored to be leading incredible team.",[107]

I did have a chance to speak with Seth bacon. he is the Executive Vice President of media for the MLS and he said that you know this is something that is working. they're they're seeing um, this partnership lead to increase of of viewership numbers and increase of signups to Apple TV. but I don't know if you could see this with other types of players, like the NFL, for example, I feel like you're going might be too, might be too big right, and you're never going to get one sole partner. when you think about the fact that one big tech company pays a billion dollars for 15 games a year, think about how much you would have to pay to have every NFL game. I think at some point it maybe is just inconceivable just from that standpoint of like how much NFL rights are worth. but you're right for MLS, it made a of sense. it's a league that wants to grow, a league that's looking for a consistent place for people to find them. I think sometimes when you're on some of these local sports networks it's useful. but also sometimes people don't really know where to find those. not everyone still has traditional cable right now. you could make the argument that oh, they're on apple plus. that's hard. I have to pay for apple plus, Etc, but at least you know where to get it. MLS is on Apple TV plus. there's one place to go and I think that's helpful for consumers from that standpoint. but it's $12.99 a month. it's yet another thing to add to your, you know, collection of screaming services. and you really got to be a big amls fan if you want to to do this, and I was a casual fan and I feel like it's a bit too much money for a casual fan to get involved. I I want to follow nycfc and not so much the Red Bulls, Etc. but, um, you know, that's, that's sort of the the equation you got to do here with with these, with this service. but I think you're right, I think it's a great service with the collect, all of it in one one spot. and you mentioned the Vision Pro, mhm. maybe there's a good use case there. someone who has this, someone who's a fan, I don't know. it's maybe a more interactive or more just Dynamic way to watch the content. yeah, and Apple's also producing a docu series, sort of similar, like we've seen with Formula 1 drive to survive. so potentially that could add more fans. and I also think Leno Messi coming to the MLS was huge for not only the league but also for apple and driving a lot of. I'm excited to see what goes on the Vision Pro from a sports perspective. if they can put you in the moment, that's the kind of thing that you don't really get right now and you would think that's where these headsets are going. so it'll be interesting to see what happens with that, yeah.",[1]

I'm curious what you can share just about some of the trends that you're seeing from the consumer and how it differs than what we saw 3 to six months ago. yeah, sure, thanks for having me. first of all, our portfolio is very strong. you know we've been on a journey for the last three years totally reshaping our business, divesting some assets and really focusing on those categories and Brands which are going to drive growth, obviously recently added the hostess business through acquisition. so, whether it's pet snacks, cat food, coffee, Uncrustables and and now sweet baked snacks, our portfolio is incredibly well positioned and our focus on our marketing and sales capabilities and just that blocking and tackling has really helped to drive this growth and give us confidence in in the future growth. the the consumer, as you highlighted some cases, is a little bit stressed, but our portfolio is Broad and we offer affordable options all the way up to premium options in each of those businesses. and as you look at Hostess and you sort of work towards finalizing that acquisition, you do play a significantly increased marketing. you said that at Kagney last week. talk us through the pricing strategy for Hostess and how this marketing will help gain new customers to the James marker portfolio. yeah, first of all, Hostess is a great brand. obviously it reaches consumer consumers who are looking for an indulgent occasion during the day. um, it's. the brand itself is very strong, pricing is about where it needs to be and we will step up marketing over time in that brand as well as continuing to keep that fast cycle Innovation that Hostess has been so good at. and Mark when, whenever we think about this company- and I'm so glad to see on the investor relations Page, by the way- Uncrustables getting the right shine that they deserve as that header photo, because we know how good the strawberry Uncrustables are. but that aside, the Frozen category particularly is always of Interest, especially for consumers who are looking to add more shelf life to their purchases as a value hack, as they're being more value conscious. where do you identify even more, perhaps, opportunities within that Arena? you know we're laser focused on Uncrustables. we are uh now meeting demand. we are producing millions of sandwiches a day. we're about to, in the next year, open our third plant in Alabama to continue to meet the demand. so we are focusing first and foremost on Peanut Butter and peanut butter and jelly peanut butter and honey, and we'll be bringing new flavors and executions to Bear. we have a reduced sugar option as well. so there's so much runway on Uncrustables because it meets so many need. States, whether that's the parent on the go- a lot of athletes consume the product. students and universities and and K through 12 schools- there's just a tremendous amount of upside for Uncrustables, okay. so leaning more on the peanut butter and Uncrustables, does that mean sunsetting or moving away from some of the ham and or the, the cheese and Uncrustables? we don't have any of those uh items now. we did temporarily launch some different formats to test those and you might recall they were in a different form or rollup. um, they did well, well, um, but we found that the the runway is really on that soft bread circular sandwich with the crimp, and so continuing to push out on that form is really where our focus is. Mark, I'm just looking forward to the GIF and chocolate that's had to come out later on this year. I do want to quickly pick your brain about coffee. we did see coffee margins improve. you did pass along some cough Savings in Q3, but saw a slight dip in volume there. how do you view pricing going forward and can consumers expect to pay less this year for for their can of Cafe Bell, particularly my mom. well, thank you for being a consumer. you know we did reduce prices on coffee uh in the last 6 months because the, the commodity had come down and our growth trajectory on coffee is continues to be driven by kup across all of our Brands. Buell is double digit. Duncan has returned to growth as we've gotten the pricing right, the relative pricing on Duncan, and we're now in the liquid coffee space. so we launched multi- serve large bottles of Duncan, now the number two brand in the coffee aisle in liquid, and we are bringing out the liquid Buell uh executions in the next several months, so you'll be seeing those on shelf as well. o okay, all right, looking forward to that.

185,VDw6Z9c6O3U,FTC sues to block Kroger's $24.6B acquisition of Albertsons,Yahoo Finance,2024-02-27 19:18:23+00:00,"roadblocks ahead for a mega merger. the Federal Trade Commission is suing to block Kroger's 24.6 billion acquisition of Albertson. the FTC believes that the deal would cause grocery price hikes for many Americans, Koger responding that the blocking of the merger will actually harm America's consumers and workers. for more on, the lawsuit were joined by Bill kovas, who is well, who served as the FTC chairman from 2008 until 2009, alongside Moselle Thompson, former FTC commissioner, who served from 1997 to 2003. great to have both of you here on the morning to discuss this first bill. want to go to you on this matter as you think about what the FTC is is looking for here and the arguments that are going to have to be put forward by both Kroger and Albertson's. what are you anticipating? uh, the FTC has gathered a considerable amount of evidence that's presented in their complaint that in a variety of geographic areas, this transaction is going to create substantial concentration in a market consisting of traditional supermarkets. I think, to some extent, uh, kroger and Albertson will contest that and say that there are retail possibilities that are being left aside, but I think they realize that, as a matter of traditional analysis, that they have a problem there. they've tried to solve it by offering a package of divestitures that includes over 400 retail outlets. a core issue in the case is going to be the adequacy of that solution. the FTC says it's not adequate, it's not going to provide robust competition. I think the key substantive issue in the case will be: how good is the divesture package and is CNS wholesale, the buyer- Going to Be an Effective purchaser and operator of those assets? Melle, what do you think of the ftc's argument and whether or not? uh, from what we know at this point, if it has a strong case, uh, the traditional criteria they're using, I think, create a, a, a, a solid case. on the question of whether we're going to see increased concentration in the market, uh, the companies recognize this, uh, and again, the the real issue is: have they come up with a solution that's going to, that's going to be sufficient? the FTC also, to an extent that it has not done before, has highlighted the effect of the transaction on workers. a key argument that the FTC is making is that the deal is not just bad for consumers, it's bad for the employees of the two companies, and again to an unprecedented degree. the TC is saying that that is a major area of harm from the transaction, uh, and I suspect that as well, is going to be a focus of the, on the, on the discussion of the adequacy of the divesture. so, more than we've seen before, uh, the FTC is emphasizing the adverse effect on workers. Melle, do you agree? yeah, well, yes, but I also would say that you have to look at what the market definition is here. one of the things that Kroger and Alberton are going to argue is that there, the, um, the people who provide groceries, that market is much bigger than the FTC may actually uh claim it. it is that they say that there are some benefits from them being at a scale where they can compete with entrance like Costco and entrance like uh, Walmart, who are major uh grocery chains now, and there are also companies like CVS and Walgreens, who are also selling groceries, and Target. so, um, they would argue that the market is much broader. but I do think, as Bill points out, they've they've made major concessions here. the question is whether those concessions will be viewed as adequate. M what in addition? in addition, the FTC is embarking on uh, uh, a, a test of its new uh merger guidelines, and that includes, as Bill mentioned, the, the uh impact on labor markets, which is a little bit uh a a broader view, that of uh competition that has traditionally been there. uh, I don't know how much the the courts will look at that and adopt it or not. that's a that's a new area. well, Melle, to expand on that, even just a little bit more, I guess, from what we know in this case, and at least the ftc's argument up until this point, what does that tell us even more just about the approach or the landscape here for mergers under the Biden Administration? well, one of the things that's happened is that they they've sent a clear message that uh mergers uh will be looked at uh more carefully and uh in a with a broader approach, looking at an array of different uh possible impacts, and I think that uh, um those, those, the test of those impacts, are going to be weighed by courts. so far, they haven't all, they haven't haven't had uh great success, but they're still whittling away at it, and I think this is what they're doing, and also the Department of Justice, you know it- um, what it also says to uh investors is that uh not deals may still get through, but it will be more expensive and be uh take more time and, to the extent that the Biden Administration wants to send a signal that, um, that, uh, that that may give a chilling effect to uh, to mergers, um, uh, that's something that has definitely happened and the market is responding to that and Bill coming back to you is: is Capital One discover, in a separate conversation, one of those deals that we anticipate could or should go through? from your perspective? I think this is one that's going to get a very close look and could well elicit a challenge, uh, uh. to go back to, to moselle's point, part of the Biden administration's program here is premised on the idea that merger policy going back over a 40-year period was far too permissive in major sectors such as Financial Services H and from both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, from the White House and from the Congress, we see demands that the competition regulators and the department of the treasury Bear Down on exactly this kind of merger. all of that points in the direction that only of a close review, but one can imagine a challenge as well. that is, the atmosphere supporting intervention is very strong here and Melle to expand on Bill's Point even more, just beyond that, just the impact that this is going to have on investors or how investors should potentially view these latest actions from the FTC well. I think what it means is that uh, the the antitrust uh climate is going to be tough, and I think that people who are looking to merge are going to have to not only look at the timing of those mergers but be able to come up with some real benefits and that show that um, and I think the deals will take place, but only the best deals and only the ones that are willing to withstand scrutiny and to take the time necessary for the review to take place. now, on Capital One, discover, there are a lot of people with their fingers in the pie. you know they're the financial Regulators who look at safety and soundness, but they're also the antitrust Regulators to look at impact on consumers, and I think what you also have here is a couple of different apples and oranges, not only people. uh, the thing you see off bat, uh the bat is uh major issues of credit cards, but don't forget that discover also has its own network that actually has a relationship with Merchants. that, in combination with a credit card provider like Capital One, puts them in a unique position in the competitive landscape. and- and some some of what you guys are saying is is very similar in terms of the atmosphere supporting in intervention at this point in time, but that also creates a risk of- like we saw with the banking crisis last year- waiting for companies to be so distressed to the point where it's only some of the largest players that can then have the balance sheets to be able to swoop in and save them. what does that have as a broader economic impact as well? Moselle, I'll go to you on that one first. well, I think that that's one of the things that the financial Regulators is going to be looking at, because this is a mega transaction but it looks a little different than the traditional banking transaction and because of that, they're going to look at what it's going to, how it's going to impact people who use the banking services of these entities. um, that's a little bit of a, a um, a review that is not particularly transparent, that not many people in the public look at very often, but it will also be very interesting to new entrance who provide certain kinds of services- whether it's PayPal or other kinds of payment services- and whether they can, whether this transaction will essentially block them from being competitive. Bill, want to offer one last thought to you on that. I I agree with moselle's assessment. I think that it's- uh, it's useful to keep in mind again the overall philosophy that the agencies in the administration bring to these matters and in looking back at earlier crisis, there's a strong belief that it was the fact of too few players in the market, too little competition, too much consolidation that painted the country into a corner. that all creates a presumption that deep consolidations of this kind are problematic.",[217]

I'm laughing because that was a CEO answer if I've ever heard one um. on the flip side, though, you you're looking at uh cutting the quarterly dividend when you reported and you had to reset your dividend policy, in part because you're absorbing new Crest and you have to sell a lot of assets to kind of make this acquisition uh happen and you have to deal with synergies and stuff. part of that is $2 billion in cash sale of assets. how's that going all going to plan, Alex? it's what we announced back in in May of last year when we announced the deal, we said there'd be synergies. we said there'd be $2 billion of cash from portfolio optimization. we expected to adjust our Capital allocation to match the transform business. we'll get our balance sheet nice and fit. we'll pay a $1 a share based dividend. we'll get $2 billion of proceeds at least coming in from those Investments. uh, and and a good portion of that money will go towards our $1 billion share buyback. everything consistent with what we announced in May of last year. how soon do you think those divestments will come, Tom? and once they are done, where does that put new M? we committed to work through six uh assets that we held for divestment. we worked through those for the course of the next 12 months. process has started with two of them. there's a bunch in North America that will start in the next months or so. so we're on track. got clear plans to uh to have that work through over the course of this year. uh, our focus is on delivering the value and the synergies from our go forward tier one portfolio. that's our Focus for 2024. get beyond that. we've got some very big copper gold projects sitting in the wings waiting to uh increase our exposure to copper in 25, 26 and Beyond. really exciting time are those new projects. are they of the same cost Effectiveness as what you have now? we? we have projects that are the Envy of not only the gold mining industry, the mining industry. we have three big copper gold projects: one in British Columbia, one in Peru, one in papan guini. they are of a scale that is the match of any uh copper mining, gold mining company. a really exciting project pipeline that we have sitting there waiting to be implemented and Mark Bristo might challenge you on that, Tom. but fair enough, um, Tom, I'm curious as to how uh running your business in terms of your input cost, your labor, your energy costs. what are you noticing? what's the trend? what's this year going to be for you on that front? everything's pretty consistent with what we're predicting for this year and probably pretty consistent with what we saw last year. so there is some stability in terms of uh, our cost base. what also comes as we transform our business. we'll be about $1,300 an ounce this year. is what we've guided to, but as we bring on new ounces and improve costs with our transform portfolio over the next two or three years, we'll bring that down to $1,150 an oun. so really strong margins out of our portfolio. so it's a combination of focus on cost product it improvements but also new ounces that we're investing in to bring on board over the next two or three years. Tom, as uh, inflation sort of rolls over as the FED winds up, uh, cutting rates. have you had Bitcoin ETFs, maybe ether ETFs, coming onto the market? do you feel like that's just going to at some point stop Gold's rise? there're just other assets and other macro factors. it's going to make gold as an asset class less appealing, which then filters down to Newmont stock. we're pretty excited about the long-term view of go. we wouldn't. we wouldn't have the the the of T1 portfolio that we have. we got 10 T1 operations in our portfolio. uh, we're very, we're very excited about the potential of gold, the long-term potential of gold. but the key is to have a margin to whatever that gold price is. so when you're running at$ $1,200 an ounce, you've got a great margin. you're resilient means you can be generating cash through the cycle, and that's our focus with our long-term portfolio.",[210]

Well, David, if you go back five years, we really were, I think, tasked with two simple objectives. One was a significant deleveraging of our balance sheet. Secondly, we needed to execute an operational turnaround across the business, but it was particularly acute in our Power segment, particularly the gas power business that Scott ran at the time. So you fast forward. we reduced our debt load by over $100 billion. Scott and the team really executed, I think, a phenomenal turn in gas power. And then, with the rest of our Power segment- and we were sitting there as the pandemic was beginning to lift, we could see the merger of our aircraft leasing business with one of our key competitors, Aercap, coming to a quick close and we really had to decide what's the go forward structure for GE And, given we had had so much success with the decentralization work, given that the capital markets clearly liked the businesses but didn't like them together. it was actually an easy decision when we took a little over two years ago to say it'll take us a couple of years to pull this off. But when the dust settles, she health care, she Ivanova and she aerospace will all be on their own bottoms. You may have just answered that in your answer, which is: why did you pick Scott Not to not to speak on your budget in your presence, Scott? But how did you pick Scott? Is it because of the role he had in the turnaround? Most definitely, David. I met Scott back in August of 18.. I wasn't even in this chair yet. It was the first GE business that I had visited down in Atlanta and I came away thinking this is a really strong team, but there's some things that we're doing that probably are working against us. So we began the pivot to focus more on the businesses as opposed to the segment. Scott was running gas power services at the time. We asked him to step up and do a big job to run all of gas power. We knew that was job one with respect to the overall operational turnaround at GE and he and the team, I think, executed near flawlessly through that. And then he picked up additional responsibility with the rest of the power segment and then in turn, the renewables businesses And in each step of the way Scott stepped up, delivered, built teams that did the same. So when it came time to think about the next CEO for this business as a public entity, Scott was an easy choice. So, Scott, now you've got the big job. I suspect even was flawless his term. It was not easy to do that Turnaround. What, in your experience in GE, and specifically in that turnaround, really do you think prepares you for this big new role? Well, I mean, he's always been a great laboratory to learn and experiment and we've always had great people. But I think over the last 5 to 5 and a half years really, the lean operating system that we've been implementing- and really started with gas right in 19, where we were on a monthly cadence with Larry and really focusing a team that always had great ambition- But did we really have an ability to focus on the critical few customer KPIs every day while also protecting for the long term breakthroughs and the ability to multitask- those things Our teams weren't always great with and that's really a lot of what we were focused on in 19 and 20 together is to build that rhythm that we could prioritize what mattered most to get the short term right, but not at the expense of also investing for the long term. And that's a lot of what we worked on in gas power together and in 19.. And that was really foundational for gas power And it's really what we've been extrapolating across the rest of Nova. So, as you take over this new role, tell me what the opportunities you see and break it down, if you would, between two categories. One is the one you just talk about: operationally, You're lean approach- and what that does- really more opportunities to really drive that further and how much. it's just a rising tide with energy transition. We are excited about the markets that and where they're going, and there are a lot of examples of that today. You know data centers in the US represented 2% of the load growth in 2020.. Many people think it could be 8% by 2030. It's just an illustration that our customers see more demand today than they've seen yesterday, At the same time that we need to continue to decarbonize the electric power system in totality. So there clearly are opportunities for us to serve this market while simultaneously we continue to run. the business is better. So talk about that decarbonization, because I did notice it's electrification and decarbonization, It's both of them, It's not either. or How much of this is just business and how much of this is actually sustainability. Well, sustainability really is at the heart of everything we're doing, And for us, we define sustainability as the complement of both together: keeping the lights on while decreasing the carbon intensity, the install base, every day. And it'd be wonderful if we could wave a magic wand and have no carbon. But the reality is that's not the world we live in. So how do we sustainably electrify the world while making it cleaner every day? They really go together, and to do that it really does require a complement of technologies. And that's where Renault is somewhat unique, because we've got the power generation technologies with things like gas, nuclear, wind. But we also play across the grid at both moving electrons, orchestrating the grid and the systems becoming more complicated, And our ability to serve our customers with all of the solutions gives us a unique vantage point.",[39]
189,ZQQDyHrM0rs,"Markets in 2 Minutes: HK Stocks Drop Is AMD, NPC and Apple",Bloomberg Television,2024-03-05 08:18:58+00:00,"Let's talk about the markets in a couple of minutes then, shall we? And let's focus in focusing first on what's going on in China. How much do you look to the Hang Seng down 2.6%? How much do you look to that for a reading on market disappointment with what's come at the NPC? I think that's quite a bit about the AMD story rather than the NPC. meeting of the NPC has not impressed the market. I'm not saying it's massively, it's disappointed by failure to impress, If that makes sense. Rather than being real negative headlines, everyone is hoping that they might really follow through on some of the recent measures and provide some new excitement. They didn't say NPC was a slight negative. and then you get this AMD news. that's kind of herding tech. And then you got this Apple story to kind of come in and hammer the point. Tech is looking vulnerable. now, as we know, Tech is decides everything's of techs looking a little bit vulnerable. It's a little bit tricky in the short term. So I wouldn't call Hong Kong stocks all about NPC. It's a mixture of dynamics. Okay, Thinking about tech being vulnerable, let's go to the US then and what's comes front and center for you. Is it the Fed narrative driving things? Is it the growth story driving things or is it just? are tech stocks too frothy? I mean all of these, perhaps I don't. There's the growth story, I think. first of all, I think markets are certainly getting exciting Again. I feel the last couple of weeks we've got to be drifting a little bit and suddenly it's a very newsy day, Like I walked in this morning, and there's so many different dynamics going on at the moment. So I think that you know today is the first really exciting day for a while And you're asking what's driving it? I think Tech, Apple's Boring People, Magnificent seven- it's a second- magnets in seven showing cracks and we're also getting a little bit more hawkish. Fed people start to have to reconsider that. Wait a sec. The dot plot next door might actually be more hawkish than the last one, rather than more dovish. We thought the direction of travel was only one way. that's now being challenged is the risk for this week is slightly hawkish. Powell- We heard that from BNP Paribas earlier on, I think. definitely I'm don't expect him to be. he can't be overly hawkish. He completely undermined himself, But I think he's going to want to try opening up the optionality again, as we kind of- we use that phrase a lot, But I think it's true, I think he's they must be awareness that they've kind of messed up in December by being so explicitly dovish, so prematurely, And I think now he wants to go, not suddenly go overall all hawkish, but he wants to give himself the option of maybe not being that dovish.","[1, 24]"
190,Z2W5A8BUBAo,Warren Buffettâ€™s Berkshire HathawayÂ Posts Record Cash Pile,Bloomberg Television,2024-02-26 00:26:55+00:00,"[CC may contain inaccuracies]. What's your takeaway, other than valuations are high, from these? numbers that we've gotten were obviously really intriguing that that cash pile is so big now. but it's more about kind of the some of the exploring and deals that they have been looking at and kind of have shied away from. So clearly there's still kind of a lot going on. You know we've had subdued deal activity around the world but there have been, you know, deals going through And indeed Berkshire has still been spending money in certain areas. But of course it does speak to not just elevated valuations in the equity market but in some of the other markets. You know there are still a number of areas in private markets particularly testing. So I think it tells us a few things really. But one is that it was a very notable comment about opportunities outside of the US being essentially zero and really not finding much opportunity beyond the borders of the US. And Japan of course, has been one of the big focuses for for, for for Berkshire, and that's been an interesting market for the way that they've been buying businesses there but also for the broader impact that international capital flowing into Japan now has become really a huge story And of course the Nikkei, taking out the the historical levels last week, shows you just how much of a change in sentiment there have been to to, to to Japanese businesses in recent times and inverters obviously one huge component of that. they see, and continue to see, some really interesting ideas there. So I think Japan still stands out as a key market for them there. Yeah, And in Japan as well as places like Australia, is interesting. We have seen deal activity picking up a little bit. What does it tell you about, I guess, broader risk appetite right now? We have haven't? we heard we've seen some deals kind of coming through in the early part of this year. I mean we're only kind of, you know, just almost getting into March, So just a couple of months It is still early, but but there have been some pretty notable transactions And especially if you, if you look here, you know some of the Japanese M&A coming into Australia- renaissance, that, that deal- and indeed with some of these businesses that Berkshire's bought in in Japan, these trading houses. that's an $8 billion investment now and you know they're there for a far longer term turnaround story there And of course, a lot of the reasons why they're there is because of some of these long term changes in shareholder attitude that you know, changes that don't take a few months to take many years to come through. We're starting to see the early signs of that in Korea. whether that becomes another market for them in the future on those kind of terms or we'll have to wait and see. But yeah, clearly some deals are coming back now and you're starting to see some opportunity there for them.",[6]
191,ruNNQtsBsyM,GE Vernova's Solo Journey,Bloomberg Television,2024-03-08 23:59:35+00:00,"Just over two years ago now, GE announced plans to divide its business into three publicly traded companies focused on health care, energy and aviation. GE health care was spun off just over a year ago and early next month The last piece will fall into place when GE separates into GE Aerospace and given Nova and company its energy business. We sat with the GE CEO who has overseen the restructuring from the start, Larry Culp, and the man who will be CEO of Govern over Scot Strategic. If you go back five years. we really were, I think, tasked with two simple objectives. One was a significant deleveraging of our balance sheet. Secondly, we needed to execute an operational turnaround across the business, but it was particularly acute in our Power segment, particularly the gas power business that Scott ran at the time. So you fast forward. we reduced our debt load by over $100 billion. Scott The team really executed, I think, a phenomenal turn in gas power.

Well, I mean has always been a great laboratory to learn and experiment and we've always had great people. But I think over the last 5 to 5 and a half years, really, the lean operating system that we've been implementing- and really started with gas right in 19, where we were on a monthly cadence with Larry and really focusing a team that always had great ambition. But did we really have an ability to focus on the critical few customer KPIs every day while also protecting for the long term breakthroughs and the ability to multitask- those things Our teams weren't always great with- and that's really a lot of what we were focused on in 19 and 20 together- is to build that rhythm that we could prioritize what mattered most to get the short term right, but not at the expense of also investing for the long term. And that's a lot of what we worked on in gas power together and in 19.. And that was really foundational for gas power And it's really what we've been extrapolating across the rest of her Nova. So, as you take over this new role, tell me what the opportunities you see and break it down, if you would, between two categories. One is the one you just talk about: operationally You're lean approach and what that does really more opportunities to really drive that further and how much. it's just a rising tide with energy transition. We are excited about the markets, that and where they're going, and there are a lot of examples of that today. You know data centers in the US represented 2% of the load growth in 2020.. Many people think it could be 8% by 2030.. At the center of our NOVA strategy is growing its energy business in the midst of a massive transition to more sustainable energy around the world. Its chief sustainability officer, Roger Martella, gives us an example how renewable will set its priorities in building out the electrical grid in a way that is both good business And good for the climate. We know we're going to deploy the technology and run businesses to develop technology to electrify the grid, But from a sustainability perspective, we want to do more than just put capacity on the grid. We want to focus on where are we putting that capacity? How are we helping countries that are struggling to provide affordable, reliable, sustainable electricity? Can we double click on those countries and make sure we're not just going where the phone's ringing, but how can we affirmatively reach out to places in the world to enhance sustainability? when it comes to electrification, Sustainability really is at the heart of everything we're doing, and for us, we define sustainability as the complement of both together: keeping the lights on while decreasing the carbon intensity, the install base every day, And it'd be wonderful if we could wave a magic wand and have no carbon, But the reality is that's not the world we live in. So how do we sustainably electrify the world while making it cleaner every day?

So, Larry, as somebody who is about to turn over the keys- if I can put that way to power- how do you assess their opportunities going forward? I mean, what are the really growth opportunities for Ivanova? Well, I think you just hit on it, David in the question and Scott talking about all the different dimensions of the energy transition. We have excellent exposure, leadership positions really in almost all the ones that matter. So I don't really worry about the top line environment in this business, in that we couldn't have said that four or five years ago, but the world over, I think we really are set in that regard. So we need to make sure we execute. How does wind fit into what you're doing? Because that's been more of a struggle, not just for GE but for others as well. as opposed to gas power, How do you see wind playing out? You bet It has been an industry wide challenge, but if you take a step back and think about the world today. it gets about 7% of its power from electricity, from wind. Most projections believe by 2040 that needs to be closer to 25%. So wind matters, But the reality is we need to industrialize at scale the wind products to a level that it can actually reach those levels, And that's really what we're focused on right now is building workhorse products that we can do at scale. We're seeing real progress with that. We've turned our onshore wind business back to profitability the second half of last year, with momentum to follow. We're working on doing much of the same with our offshore wind business. today The government plays a large role in Vancouver's future as it has seen the public private partnerships strengthen over the last 18 to 24 months. I do think in the electric power system, public private partnerships are always going to matter. We've built this grid and the system over 100 years on the foundation of public private partnerships, But there's a lot of other drivers beyond that. today The reality is industries are electrifying and they're going to electrify either way. We think about EVs, we think about home heating and heat pumps. That's going to happen And that demand cycle exists regardless. But there's also always going to be a role for that public private partnership. Jennifer Granholm, the secretary of energy, likes to say the energy transition should be private sector led, enabled by the public sector. And that's just been this fundamental realignment between the public sectors and the private sectors That's given us great tailwinds to go ahead and partner with the government to accelerate innovation and technology.",[39]
192,Z4ggR16Stu4,Charter Communications to Weigh Altice USA Takeover,Bloomberg Television,2024-02-26 21:49:58+00:00,"Shares of Altice now soaring more than 50% On the back of that news that Charter Communications is exploring a takeover of the cable provider, Abigail Doolittle Joining us right now to talk a little bit more about this- and we should just point out this is according to people familiar with the situation. the companies have not confirmed or denied what's going on, But the reporting right now is that these two companies would tie up, says Altice has about 5 million or so customers. How many customers does Charter have? What are we looking at? in total, It would be the biggest broadband company if they came together with about 35 million subscribers. So instantly you think of regulatory concerns. But if we back up as to the why, as why this might happen, both of these companies have really been struggling. Earlier this month, Charter lost 61,000 Internet subscribers, which was what we were just talking about. Doesn't sound like a lot, but given a year ago that there was a gain of 105,000 subscribers, numbers are going in the wrong way. So for two reasons: One, people are cutting the cord And then, second, there's lots of competition from the wireless providers. I have certainly done that myself in the past. The three largest gained nearly a million subscribers in the fourth quarter. So when you put that together with Charter's loss, you can understand that they're in pain. Now, Altice is one of the largest providers. It's smaller, of course, than Charter, but one of the largest, as you were mentioning- about 5 million subscribers there in 21 states- And Patrick Drahi- I hope I'm saying his name correctly- he's made it clear: everything is for sale. So this stock right now, as you mentioned, at the highs it was up 63%, the most since the IPO, And I should have mentioned, to just really underscore the idea of the loss that we had for Charter earlier this month The stock was down 17%, the worst since 2009,. the worst day on record. So they're really looking to do something. Do we have an idea of what the regulatory situation might be like in terms of overlap etc. kind that Charter is trying to really expand into, say, the rural population? Yes, that's true, We don't know, But in this current climate, it's very likely that the scrutiny is really going to be very tough. because not only that, when you think about this business in terms of the actual business, lots of complaints. I've certainly tried to be kind about the complaints, but you know, complaints about high prices and also bad customer service. So when you think about that sort of a cable company, No, no, never, never. But when you think about those factors, you know, for the end of the day, the experience of the end user, and then that it would create the biggest and then, right here in New York, it would create total dominance. So, yeah, it's probably not going to fly right through investors, though they seem. obviously Altice investors seem to be very enthused by, yeah, charter shares and only down a couple percentage points, which would seem to suggest that people have somewhat okay with it. I mean, if they were really on okay with it, you would see the shares down a lot more. It's probably too early for charter communication. Investors are really way, and something to think about here is they do. Altice has $25 billion worth of debt and they also have a corruption scandal in Portugal which is unlikely to affect numbers for Altice USA, but it's something for people to think about. So, at the end of the day, I think that the charter communication investors are going to be thinking about whether or not this potential deal would really bring up the growth in the numbers enough to offset those negatives.",[218]

It seems like this is something similar to what Nvidia had to face when it comes to their business in China. The like, Is this quite similar, and what more do we know? Oh, so what's happening here is amd. these come up with a special, tailor made chip for China, so that's far less powerful than what they can offer their US customers. But the Commerce Department does not agree that the, this steel wall, stays under the current threshold. The US government has full what chips nuts are allowed for chips. so in the is in a slightly different situation from media. so well, after the US government said a bunch of our restrictions for what the what China can get the chip from, a media has redesigned SOC chips to fit those restrictions. but now it's, it seems like in the hasn't been able to acquire, meet these criteria and then not offer its new, newly designed chip to the Chinese market. Debbie, I guess the initial question then that investors would be asking is what the potential revenue hit would be. And again, looking at the Nvidia sort of example, are we looking at the same dynamics at play here or in our Bloomberg Intelligence have already come up with a fresh note saying that they don't expect employees to get significantly hit because of all this news. This is because of well, in the chip market and media remains the dominant player in the market And then- and this ourselves in the chip sector- isn't as sizable as a beat as well. We are also not expecting that And these are in ability to offer the new chip to the Chinese market to hit their top line very significantly.",[24]

We all fell off on a united plane. There was a fire, a minor fire on the engine, minor fire, And like, put that into perspective for us because we can sit here and joke about it. We're glad no one was injured, We can joke about it and then be like, oh, Boeing. But like these are issues that happen with planes a lot, Right, So where's the distinction between Boeing's got real problems with like yes, this is normal stuff that happens to planes. Yeah, There's been a lot of Boeing news. The NTSB came out, said they weren't cooperating. You know Boeing has specifically said they did provide names and they're cooperating as much as they can. I do believe that they are providing as much detail as they can. Part of the issue is in their manufacturing process. potentially they don't have the documentation and that's what results in some of these back and forth. But you know the stock's at 200.. They're going to report February orders and deliveries on Tuesday at 11 am And we think they could come out with as low as 17 deliveries on the max. Keep in mind they should be at 38 today. We know they're not at 38 because the FAA is monitoring them, telling them to stop production. Yeah, So all this news flow doesn't help. And of course, the Spirit news last week. there's a deal that's probably imminent. Yeah well, what do you make of that, that spirit deal? I mean, do you think that that would help them by having this back in-house, fully in-house? Does that help with quality control and some of these other issues? Or is this just maybe just add another burden, I guess, to what Calhoun's trying to do over there? Yeah, I think you know. clearly Dave Calhoun 12 months ago or nine months ago was not so keen on in housing spirit. You know what they've done is put in a Boeing 30 year veteran to run spirit. He's been there since October 3rd and potentially he could turn it around. But clearly there's other factors in here, like the FAA asking Boeing to take it in-house. but it's probably not the best idea in our view, just because Boeing has to focus on its own production line and whether it's not going to bring the Wichita work to Renton. it's still going to stay in Wichita and be separate, So it's going to just be under the umbrella in name only, but not really Exactly Gotcha. But one quick point on that: Don't they have to, kind of by spirit. Like I said, you better them focus on production line, But don't they have to? I mean, is there any other option? Spirit could be a standalone entity. still, Yeah, it's. it's gone through the worst of things. It lost about 350 million of cashflow last year. It had a free cash flow outage. They refinanced their debt. They're actually at a turning point. They've diversified 20% of their business to Airbus. Now the problem with them- aside from the Boeing factory issues that they've had, which is quality issues- is that their Airbus work is actually still losing 200 million of annual free cash flow. So they have to do something with that. So if Boeing does take them in-house, first of all, they're not going to buy the Airbus business. What price of they're going to be able to sell it at? So the deal is messy, to say the least.",[78]

I mean, this is a a project that the company's working on for for a decade. at this point, what do we know about Apple's electric car plans? yeah, so Apple, uh, this morning officially cancelled work on a self-driving electric car. Jeff Williams, the company's Chief Operating Officer, and Kevin Lynch, the company's vice president of Technology, uh, who was foremost in charge of the car project- announced to the team- it's about 2,000 people- that the project called Titan internally is winding down. there will be layoffs of some Hardware people. Hardware people will have the opportunity to apply to other teams. other people working on the project are being shifted to Apple's Ai and machine learning division to work on generative AI products, a key future component of the company. there will some. there will some. there will be some people moved to the Vision Pro uh as well, with that focus on spatial computing. uh, but this is a bombshell development. this is a very rare Retreat for Apple. this is a project that they've invested over 10 billion in. they've worked on it for over 10 years. it's had many fits and starts. it's had many directional changes. about a month ago, we reported that apple had reached the make or break point for the car project. we reported that the latest incarnation of the project, after several meetings with the company's board of directors, was a new budget around a level two plus car. that was a downgrade from the original vision of a level four or level five fully autonomous vehicle, and they also pushed back and delayed that. uh, since then there have been more discussions and Executives made the the final decision. uh, earlier this month, I'm told, to completely shutter the project. so again, this is Apple cancelling work on an electric car. this is a significant development for one of the company's most ambitious attempts at a new product- Cate ategory- in its history. uh, so this is a very significant day for the company. yeah, very significant. it's not like it's just, you know, an idea on the back of a napkin. I mean, they had been pursuing, as you said, Mark, for over 10 years- the road was rough though in it- in Apple's pursuit in terms of bringing a car to Market. I mean, you know this company- for them to step up the amount of time, money, people, effort that they have put into something like this. um, I don't know how do you get your head around it? does it mean just completely done? does it mean that they could buy into something in the future? or they're just saying this isn't a market for us? certainly, uh, there are considerations on the table to acquire an existing car maker. uh, obviously, you've seen what's happened in the car industry lately. rivan has not been doing uh so hot uh. you've seen other car companies struggling, Lucid being one. Tesla has had its own ups and downs. it's a very, very thin profit margin business. it's not the typical business that Apple likes to get into to. but there is some risk in abandoning this project. what if alphabet, Google, wh, Amazon with zuk, some of these other big technology companies- certainly the, the Chinese uh phone makers- they're all getting into cars? what if one of these companies comes up with a great car idea one day and successfully creates a new ecosystem of its own? uh to rival apples? and they can risk pulling people away from Apple into a Google car or an Amazon car and getting them on their other products in the ecosystem. so there're certain some very long-term risk here, uh, but in the short term this may be a good thing for Apple being able to focus resources towards perhaps more promising areas in the short term, like spatial Computing and generative artificial intelligence. well, that's exactly where I wanted to go with you. next, Mark, to you: is this more about Apple saying no to a car and less about Apple focusing resources on AI, or is it the other way around here? is it all about Apple saying, wait a second? the rise in interest in generative AI over the last 18 months has just been massive and we need to go all in on this, such that we need to actually cancel our work on the car in order to do that. it's certainly not not the lad, uh, Tim. this is Apple making a decision to wind down the car project because they weren't getting anywhere. it kept getting delayed, it kept getting more expensive. they have, uh, these hundreds and thousands of employees. uh, that are brilliant people and we have places for them. generative AI is a key area. let's throw them there. there's a lot of artifici, IAL intelligence, machine learning, overlap, uh, between work on an autonomous vehicle and what needs to be done for the future of AI on phones and watches and earbuds and glasses and such, so it makes sense to reallocate those resources. but don't be mistaken: this is a decision all about cancelling the car. they just happen to have an excellent soft Landing, uh, for the resources that have been invested in the vehicle project. okay, so if you're an investor in apple and you're saying to yourself: I'm a little concerned about the cine in iPhone sales in China, I'm a little concerned about the traditional Apple products being long in the tooth here, I don't necessarily see promise, at least right now, in spatial Computing, Mark, what is there on the horizon for these investors to get excited about? because I think on a lot of Minds have been: okay, well, at least Apple's working on a car here and that'll be out at some point. certainly, the uh Vision Pro is something that apple is focused on. that is a big new category for them. uh, and certainly, generative AI airpods with cameras is something I wrote about. the eventual debut of augmented reality glasses- uh, there are certainly, you know, other things on the road map that could be exciting, uh, but nothing that would drive as much immediate Revenue as a 100 Grand car. yeah, talk about it. right, that really moves the needle. um, it's a woe moment, as we say, but another Exclusive by you, Mark. um, that's really got everybody kind of rethinking some of the of what Apple's doing in the future. uh, it's just a really, really big deal. I will say Apple share is still up about half a percent, but nonetheless, um, really interesting when it comes to Apple strategy. Mark, thanks so much for for jumping in and telling us about, uh, your exclusive.",[1]
196,JecAtA-SSRM,FAA Slams Safety Culture at Boeing in New Report,Bloomberg Television,2024-02-28 17:44:05+00:00,"You're not getting a competitive bar wink. They're listening, They know they've got to respond. They know they've got to fix it. I want to give you credit. You came out early and talked about the culture that something was wrong within this company. What are we learning from the regulator in the people conducting this review? I think, to your point, they are saying the right things now, but it would have meant a lot more if they had been saying this earlier, and they had plenty of opportunity to do that in the wake of the two max great crashes. And I think what's important to note here is this report was started in March 2023. They didn't start this investigation into Boeing safety practices because of what happened with Alaska Airlines. That was a symptom of a culture that is just lacking. when you read this, The crux of it is really: how do you figure out how to get bad news to the people that can do something about it before it morphs into a crisis? How do you flag problems before you have something like Alaska Airlines Happen? And this just goes back to the basics of how you run a manufacturing company. It shouldn't be that hard, but I think in practice it is not just for Boeing, but for some of these other companies that have sort of lost sight of what they really do and that is manufacture products. You know what I think about GE a lot, just because these companies do share so much overlap from their executives over the years And you look at the transformation under that company And CEO. Larry Culp is known for being extremely hands on, for being very invested in what happens on his factory floors at Boeing. Dave Calhoun is known for being the opposite of being more hands off. I don't know if that's what Boeing needs right now. I think you really need somebody to get in there and to pay attention to what's happening with these manufacturing processes, because I think the people at the factories pay attention to that. They pay attention to what the executives are saying and what they're doing. And when you move your headquarters to Arlington, Virginia, even further away from that of a 37 factory outside of Seattle, I do think that send a message Interesting separate. Let's talk about personnel. Tell us about the changes that have happened and the changes that you'd anticipate to happen in the coming weeks and months. At Boeing specifically, I think you know there's been a number of different changes If you look sort of over the the time period in the wake of the max crashes, we've seen sort of a revolving door of executives And yet I still don't feel like- and if you look at this report- that they have their hands around. you know what exactly is wrong here with the culture and part of it. Just to go back to your initial point about you know they're saying the right things now, but we have not ever heard from Boeing top management. We have a culture problem. They've been very reluctant to say that this is some sort of systemic issue And you know the reasons for that are perhaps obvious when you're talking to analysts and investors. But I do think you know addressing this problem starts with calling it out and accepting it and really being willing to get your hands dirty and dig in and figure out how you solve this. Well, regulators seem to have attempted here just to give some details and what they found? constant changes to complex procedures and trainings leading to confusion. Other shortcomings hindered the average employee's understanding of their role in how Boeing manages safety. I mean, this is pretty basic. And then it said that regulators requested information that Boeing demonstrate commitment to safety because the materials it received- quote- did not provide objective evidence of a foundational commitment to safety that matched Boeing's descriptions? Can Dave Calhoun remain at the head of a company where you had this type of scathing description from US regulators, trying to understand why there have been repeated errors and repeated incidents? I think you have to think about the incentives of the different players here, And I think what makes Boeing so unique is that it exists in a duopoly, that you were never really going to have the type of accountability to Boeing that you might have at another company, simply because the world cannot exist just with Airbus airplanes. You know you do have some planes coming out of China, out of Comac, which had a pretty impressive showing at the Dubai Air show, But you're just never going to see the Western world buy those planes, And we just cannot live in a world where there is only Airbus. And so I think you know you've seen customers come out and be a lot more aggressive in their criticism of Boeing in the wake of the Alaska Airlines incident, But at the end of the day, they also want their airplanes, And so I think it's going to be really interesting to see just how much pressure there ultimately is on Boeing to change its ways, because I think you could argue that in the wake of the max incidents, there wasn't enough pressure, or certainly Boeing didn't feel it, for the FAA to now be able to come out with a report like it, just it. the CEO will be sitting down with the head of the FAA today. What do you expect anything tangible to come from that, Brooke? You know, I think it'll be interesting to see how much they actually share about what's discussed in that meeting. I think, you know, if Dave Calhoun wants to show that he is taking this seriously, they should come out with something tangible, and it needs to be real. I mean, we've heard about changes from Boeing, you know, to two ways in which they've improved their safety culture. I think it needs to go beyond that. I think you need to really get specific and talk about how you're going to address some of these issues that were raised in the FAA report. I mean, I think that's what they should do now: how much they'll actually talk about changes that they're making or what was discussed. what we'll have to see.",[78]
197,gG1dcpi8stg,FTC Sues to Block $24.6 Billion Kroger-Albertsons Deal,Bloomberg Television,2024-02-26 17:51:44+00:00,"The FTC sued to block Kroger's $24.6 billion acquisition of Albertsons, arguing that the tie up would lead to lower wages for workers and higher prices for groceries. Bloomberg's Sara Forden joins us now from DC. And Sara taking a look at the route that the FTC is taking here- Not necessarily surprising in this case. Yeah, this, this suit was widely expected. In fact, we saw the news last week that it was going to be coming as soon as this week. This deal unites the top two supermarket owners in the country. It would bring together labels like Albertsons, Safeway and Kroger and Harris Teeter. So a lot of overlap here. The companies say they need it to in order to compete better with companies like Amazon and Walmart, But the FTC is not buying that. They also turned away a proposed remedy that the companies offered. They proposed selling 413 stores to another supermarket operator. They didn't think that was viable and they pointed to a history of failed remedies in the supermarket and many landscaped in the past.",[217]

How about no rate cuts this year at all? Live from studio two here at bloomberg headquarters in new york. i'm Romaine Bostick- Pretty bold call, It is a bold. and Alix Steel? Is that like kind of more hikes? then in theory, All right, Let's take you out to the closing bell right here in the US. I'm Alix Steel, All right. So the S&P is up by 8/10 of 1%. We've got ISM manufacturing with. the headline level Didn't look great, but underneath things are holding up really, really well And you do see that reflected within the equity market. A big part of that is going to be tech. However, you take a look at the Russell 2000,. we're still up 1%. So that outperformance continuing. the economy was rolling over. Would you really see small caps continue to outperform? I want to take a look at the 210 curve because you had Governor Walker of the Fed in a semiannual report. There's a meeting for Fed officials going on right now on. Michael McKee is they're basically saying that he wants the Fed to buy more in the front end of the curve. So you really see a bull steepening here because more demand coming in in the front end of the curve, So yields a bit higher there on the back end And crude over 80, or was over 80 for the first time since November, I don't know. remain. Is that because of demand? stronger economy, you tell me, yeah, big stealth move in the commodities space, something I think we should focus a little bit more on, Alex. but there's so much to choose from today, A lot going on, whether it's that rally in chip maker stocks to the sell off and regional banks, the cracks in the corporate IT market to the resignation of at least four major CEOs, and equity investors taking it all in and saying, yeah, I'm still buying the dip. The strongest February performance for the S&P and the Nasdaq since 2015, feeding into a strong start here in March 2024, as many traders still clinging to their belief that the Fed will cut interest rates and they will do so multiple times this year. That is the consensus on Wall Street. But at least one person out there is ready to break consensus and say what seemed unthinkable just a few weeks ago: that the Fed maybe won't cut rates at all. Apollo chief economist, Torsten Slok, telling clients in a note that a re accelerating US economy will prevent the FOMC from easing. Tom Keene had a chance to catch up with Dawson this morning and ask him for an explanation. The market now has to realize that the data is just not slowing down And, if it pivot, has given an additional tailwind to the economy and to financial markets and financial conditions and to capital markets, and all that is likely to continue to be supporting growth in consumer spending and CapEx spending in hiring for most likely, the better part of this year. Now, if that sounds familiar, maybe it's because, well, Fed members have been saying something similar for weeks now: Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic just today, reiterating he wants to wait to start cutting. five other Fed officials speaking today on the same topic And next week the Grand Puba Fed chair, Jerome Powell. Alex will have to say something, I would think, because he's got two days of testimony on Capitol Hill, Right, And what are you going to do when the senators, for example, push back on a weak economy in their constituents, whereas the numbers continue to be really good? So here is I try to sum up what Torsten Slok was talking about. He hit a lot of points and a lot of charts in his notes, So I decided to go ahead and pick this one. So the white line is the Bloomberg US Financial Conditions index. When it goes down, it means conditions are tightening. it goes up, it means conditions are loosening. And the blue line is the S&P And I mean I don't know. just look at it. They're really tracking each other here. You saw the bottom there in October for both. And then a grind: higher Financial conditions, looser, looser, looser, Equity markets, higher, higher, higher, And that's continuing. What's going to slow that down? I think the point is, if you have financial conditions continue to be loose, why would you then wind up cutting? Would you be cutting into some kind of bubble? Would you be cutting into a better economy? And how would that really work? remain? Well, the answer to that, I guess, depends on, well, how you actually view the economy. Let's get the view of our first guest to help us kick off to the close here on this Friday afternoon: Cathy Andrea, Joining us right now. chief economist over at Nationwide. Kathy, great to see you. as always, You got me a little tongue tied today, but I do want to get your thoughts really on kind of where we stand right now. You saw that PC report. you saw the CPI pie the week before. You've seen the GDP numbers. I don't know. It seems like a strong economy to me, Unless there's something else out there we should be paying attention to. Well, Hi, roommate, Always good to talk to you. Yeah, there's a lot of momentum in the economy. so you know, I do have some sympathy, for what person is is Slack is saying, you know financial conditions have eased at a time when you know we do have that strong momentum does raise the question, you know, does the Fed really need to to cut rates? But you know, I think if you look beneath some of the numbers of the headline, you do see some slowing in inactivity. Real consumer spending which we we got yesterday was was negative on the month And and that suggests that, you know, maybe the consumer's starting to rein things in a little bit. We had a big pop in personal income, but the savings rate is still really low. Well, you know what, Below 4% So, and we're seeing delinquencies on and credit cards and auto loans increase. So to me and our group, you know we see the consumer as sort of overextended at this point, or at least portions of it, And they're not prepared for any slowdown in the labor market. Now, granted, if we don't get a slowing in employment growth, in wage growth, then consumer could continue to power along and and the economy will. But you know, if we got to see some pull back, you know that's going to hit the consumer pretty hard. Well, when it comes to the Fed funds rate and this kind of piggybacks off what Alex was kind of getting at, with regards to at least financial market conditions, I mean, how restrictive right now is five and a quarter or five and a half percent here? I mean, I know, relative to the last cycle we were and that's restrictive, but relative to history that's still seems pretty low. And you know, in real terms, if you adjust for inflation, you know we're at a level now that is, you know, typically consistent with late cycle, you know. and and then the next couple months or a quarter, you know tends to be recessionary. Now, part of it is we haven't been at that restrictive real level for very long, Right, So so the real Fed funds rate, you know is is quite high right now, you know, over 2%, But we've only been there for for a short period of time. The longer that persist, I think that keeps open a question of whether you know we end up having a hard landing, for now doesn't seem to be the case, Right, Lots of strong momentum and and recession fears are behind us, But the Fed does keep, you know, the brakes on a little longer. You have to wonder, you know, how long can we persist here, Right? Remember, the consumers have gone through most of their pandemic related savings, and the housing market is still pretty stalled because of high interest rates. So does this, though, become like a chicken and an egg thing? So everything you're saying is true, And if we get weak data points, then we start to sort of start pricing that in, But then we anticipate that the Fed will cut, maybe bring forward those cuts. therefore, that loosens financial conditions and actually inhibits the transmission of monetary policy. Is that the kind of weird hamster wheel that we're in? Well, you know, usually the Fed does, you know, ease and cut interest rates and financial conditions. ease once there's signs of a slowing economy, Right, But this time, it does seem a bit different, Right, that they're going to error on the side of being slower to ease and cut rates. You know, there's that old adage, you know, they ride the elevator on the way down and the escalator on the way up, and they're raising rates, and the opposite this time, Right, And I think that just still, you know, gives us some pause, They are right Again, things look good, but then they cut rates. You know it's supposed to help, you know buffer the economy, but it doesn't really necessarily save it from from a downturn. All right, Kathy, always great to talk to you. Kathy NASDAQ there, chief economist at Nationwide, helping us kick off to the close here on this Friday afternoon with a lot of great interviews up ahead on the big program, including a sit down with Antonio Neri, the CEO of HP as a company cutting its full year forecast, His take on what's driving the slowdown in corporate IT investment- except that's Governor Walrath or Williams or Waller one of those guys. Anyway, we're also going to take a look at Fubo. It is on the move after the sports streaming platform released some results: A conversation with the CEO, David Gambler, about the report, as well as the company's legal battles against the likes of Disney and Fox. And a closer look at NYSE, the New York Community Bank, plunging the bank, flagging material weaknesses and a CEO who's out the door. A deeper dive into our stock of the hour. Stick around. A lot more coming up right here. on the close on Bloomberg, We already know that the social media platform Reddit is planning to IPO this year, And now some fresh details as to when that might happen. The Wall Street Journal reporting that Reddit is preparing to IPO this month- here in the month of March- and looking to aim for a range of valuation range of $31 to $34 a share in that IPO. That would give it a valuation of about six and a half billion dollars. Once again, this is based on reporting from The Wall Street Journal, Their reporter finding, based on people familiar with the situation there, Reddit will debut at some point this month, looking for a range of 31 to $34 a share. Alex, All right, Looking forward to that. They're also allowing to some employees to sell some shares in that IPO. All right, Let's get to shares of HP. They're in the green after initial weakness, The company cutting its full year forecast, citing lower demand for networking products and a crunch in computer chip availability. Romanian: I sat down with CEO Antonio Neri about the outlook. Supply is start to improve. We have already have a low supply, but is being now held through either customer acceptances or customer readiness to accept these products, because they need the space, the power and the cooling And in some cases you know that they are taking a little bit longer than we expected and we're going to have a lower revenue convert in the back half because of those two issues are going to be much better manageable. Say, lead times continue to be long, I mean in the 20 plus weeks. So this is the reality we are dealing with and we are setting expectations upfront with customers. That obviously is going to take that long time to get it, But the demand continued to be very strong. The pipeline is very strong. We see now demand in the enterprise space, in the influence inside and this is one of the benefits remain with as a service model, because this these systems are very expensive, near the low, low power Most of the times. they don't have neither the power or the cool in the space And honestly they don't want to outlay the massive amount of CapEx upfront. So that's why RHP Green Lake value proposition is going to help us going forward And that also will smooth the revenue linearity of the systems so that recovery In terms of lead time does that line up, explaining why your back half of this year outlook looks a little bit better. You cut your full year guidance but it does still look a little bit back loaded. Is that why? Part of Alex, and also part because we also have a lot of systems now being installed that takes, you know, another couple of quarters to get the acceptances. Remember that these systems we recognize many of the time with acceptance, not as a type of shipment, And so you have a combination of better supply and a significant number of acceptances that will materialize on the back of what I understand- Maybe you can help me clarify- is that Dell seems to be doing pretty well. So I'm just wondering what the difference is between you and Dell. Is it the CPU's like where? is it trickier? for you, I don't think there is that much difference, to be honest with you, But the investors think so because the stocks are reacting differently. Yeah Well, I think the networking softness is is actually affecting us. They'll have a networking based on it at all, And remember that we deliver amazing growth in the last two years and now you're going a little bit of a slowdown. But when it comes to the are, we booked $4 billion of cumulative orders and and we have grown equal or maybe even in some cases better than Dell. But our backlog sits at $3 billion As a. as I looked at yesterday, Dell has 2.9 billion, And the difference for us is going to be a favor for us as we go forward, because we have deep expertise in data center services. Dell doesn't have that. We have two data centers that now are up and operational to provide you as a service to customers. That would be a benefit. Third is we have a networking business to scale systems that they don't have either, particularly with HP Slingshot, and that is HP Greenlake, and Greenlake will give customers the ability to access this technology without paying CapEx. Today, Alex, the vast majority of the action we have seen has been in mobile builders, and those are, you know, our customers do just that. a lot of capital, And then, you know, just in Egypt was a bit of metal. A lot of analysts raised concerns on the call about the acquisition of Juniper Networks- a pending acquisition, I should say- and whether that pending acquisition did maybe cause a little bit of a chill for customers adopting new orders in the quarter. We have not lost one single deal, but a single customer and partner we talked to. they were excited about this combination because through these inflection point, you're going to need more network ports, not less ports, and the ability to really bring together the native world. the cloud Native world, is what customers are going to struggle And, as you think about the combination, HP will double the size of the networking business At the core. HP will be a networking company that will provide hybrid cloud- anyhow- services. From a shareholder perspective, this is amazingly accretive day one and we have a path to create more synergies as we go forward. The CEO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Antonio Neri, speaking with me and Alex a little bit earlier today here We should point out, the shares have really been oscillating. They opened not down by about five or 6% and now in the green here. But I thought you raise a good point, kind of the disparity that we're seeing in the shares of Dell, which are at record highs, having their best day ever, and not necessarily seeing that same sort of juice in HP. What's going on here? Yeah, and you look at a contract and realized basis and even before today, like those are two different stocks on two very different trajectories And I have to wonder too: do we just figure out that Dell has an AI component that you can actually invest in? that's making money? Like, is that what's happening? Well, one thing that I've been trying to get to the bottom of is. Dell was very candid about the amount of sort of AI optimized servers that it actually shipped during the quarter. HP wasn't necessarily as forthcoming about the exact amount. He talked a lot about the backlog and about all of these orders in the system, But, as you know, they don't actually get that cash until they deliver And they had troubles being able to deliver because they can't get the GPUs. Yeah, exactly, But then again the stock was down a lot more and it was up despite a downgrade. So a little bit of a pass. All right, Got to go here. We'll be back in a moment here with a closer focus on the streaming wars, the future of streaming, with the CEO of Fubotv Stick around That's coming up. next This is Bloomberg and And live streaming platform FUBU is on the path to major growth and they have the revenue and subscription numbers to prove it. Michael Pachter joining us right now, He's the managing director and equity research analyst over at Wedbush Securities. It's got an outperform rating on the shares this year under pressure here on the day. But, Michael, this is really about the long term story here And I guess whether FUBU is now kind of the new cable bundle. Yeah, I think that's right And you know, obviously we have choices. So a lot of people think YouTube TV has already won. What Fubo has done differently from the others is they've really focused on the sport. So they have the same news offering and the same kind of basic cable package of the ABC, NBC, CBS package, But they also have a lot more sports. So they're going for the sports fan. It appears to be working. And I think the best part of the story is they were. you know they burned only about $3 million of cash in the fourth quarter. They're on the precipice of being cash flow positive And once they get there I think the stock actually works. Do you think that's Baloo, which is the Disney, Warner Brothers, Discovery, Fox Sports Unit here that everyone is calling it? Is that sort of the existential threat, though? for football It is, And I think that Disney is, is and has been behaving especially stupidly. I mean how they've approached streaming. You know these guys are all. all those participants are cutting their own throats on retransmission fees because they're going to give that undecided cable subscriber an excuse to cut the cord. And so you know ESPN is not going to get its ten bucks a month per household with that. households stop subscribing. It's a really dumb idea. But you know, will they do it? Sure they'll do it, I think, through HBO's lawsuit, which is unlikely for them to win. I mean, I don't think they're going to prevail, but it's going to serve as an advance warning. The legal term is interim effect. They're going to scare Disney and the rest into making sure that they cross every T and dot every I and they don't collude. So I think it's really smart- you know positioning by football- to say: you guys better not act out of line and we're going to be right on you in court. I expect that the sports leagues are going to continue to charge whatever they can charge, But you get a better package if you're a sports fan by subscribing to Fubo than you will if you subscribe to YouTube TV plus the new sports offering. Is there any way, though? I mean, I understand the logic of why they would pursue a lawsuit like this, but is there any way that maybe this ends up sort of coming back to them, the idea here that they're going to get push back- And I don't mean just from the ESPN's and the bigger boys, but even some of the other competitors that maybe not necessarily want to side with ESPN, but certainly don't want Fubo Fubo to take the crown. Well, I think that anybody who behaves in a retaliatory manner is going to suffer a lot. I don't expect that anybody really can retaliate against them. And remember that. you know football is not suing CBS or NBC, They're they're suing this partnership and saying that they're colluding to kind of pull content from other other providers. It's not in the best interests of consumers If we have to subscribe to Peacock to watch a playoff game that you know that was an interesting experiment, but it's really not good for consumers. And you know, I think that the FTC is going to get involved in this. Ultimately. Google is going to accelerate that, of course. I just don't think that they're going to win. So what's going to happen is it's going to drag out for two or three years And we know that Disney will be on best behavior during those two or three years. They're going to step out of bounds and risk losing a lawsuit. So they're going to, they're going to behave properly And I think football's going to thrive. I really do. Hey, Michael, great stuff. Really appreciate it. Good to see you, Michael Pachter, over at Wedbush. So let's continue the conversation and do a deeper dive with the man himself. co-founder and CEO of Weibo, David Gansler. Hey, David, thank you so much for joining us. We really appreciate it. I want to start where we just left off with Michael Pachter, which is the lawsuit. Have you spoken to the Justice Department about your concerns about Sulu, for lack of a better word? Well, you know, obviously I can't comment on any of the discussions that we're having, But, as you know, we have filed the complaint And even before we filed a complaint, you know the DOJ had decided to look into it. So we'll do our best to provide as much information as possible, if when asked. But I think there's enough evidence here that warrants them to look into it. Disney, Fox and Warner Brothers have said they won't negotiate sports rights together. So how does that actually in your mind? I mean you laugh. so it seems like you don't believe it. Why not? Well, I don't know. I don't know if anyone in the world can believe it. Think about it this way: The three of us decide to buy a piece of content- Let's say you buy it- and then we're all looking at the subscriber numbers of our joint venture, And the subscriber numbers don't move. Why would I then want to bid on this type of content or piece of content the next go around. So you know, it just doesn't make any sense. There have, there has been and always will be some collusion, whether it's explicit or implicit. But again, I'll leave that to the DOJ. I'm sure there's a lot of smart people there that know where to look. What's the then the strategy here going forward, David? I don't mean specifically with this lawsuit, but the idea that you are trying to build an ecosystem here, an ecosystem that could potentially not include some major sporting events, Assuming that this deal actually goes through here. What then becomes of what you're trying to build? Yeah, well, that's actually not the case. You know we have contracts with these companies that go well beyond the launch of their joint venture. Obviously, I can't comment on the deals themselves, but we have these deals, but we're already missing content. We're missing a key component of what you would believe to be a very, very strong package, which is to the Turner Network and TBS for basketball, March Madness, hockey and baseball playoffs. So you know, again, customers vote with their wallets. We've done a tremendous job this quarter, again adding record numbers across all of our top line: KPIs, revenue, advertising, sales, subscribers. And you know, on the bottom line, four quarters now that we have delivered on that front, this quarter, our most recent quarter, now 00 million improvement in free cash flow, Right, And so you know we're doing our jobs, will continue to do that, And you know, in parallel we'll we'll be dealing with with these three, Yeah, Defendants. Where are your customers coming from, though? The new customers, I should say? Are we talking about new people kind of in the streaming space, or are this sort of people gravitating away from the individual streaming packages and going to something that's a little bit more aggregated, like, like what you have? Yeah, Well, I think, if you, if you're a focus group of one, I think you'll agree with me that it's very difficult to jump around from service to service. We offer an aggregated service with over 50,000 sporting events in the platform. We have a premium experience that's personalized with, you know, one bill, easily manageable, you know, And so we think that people will continue to look for an aggregated package of package with as much content as they can get. And, by the way, that is already evidenced in what you've seen. I mean these, these companies have started with plus services that were very thin, Then they decided to go into bundling and bundle with, you know, Verizon and other services- I think Netflix, and Paramount was one of the more recent ones that I've seen- And now, ultimately, that hasn't worked, And so the churn levels are too high. And so now they're thinking: Why don't we circumvent M&A and just jump right into a joint venture? That, in my view, is more like a sports cartel. Those are allegations, not facts. We just want to remind our viewers: allegations is true. Okay. So, David, the broadening out in terms of the ad landscape: Right, Fubo has really been a beneficiary of the ad dollars moving from linear to digital. But I'm just wondering, at some point we have to reach saturation, right, Like every ad now has the ad tier and then the non ad tier, At one point we just reach saturation. You're not able to benefit as much. Yeah, well, I think on the subscriber side, you're already seeing that, right, If you combine the pay-TV ecosystem with the virtual ecosystem can get to about 75, 80 million households. If you look at Netflix, which is, you know, the the pinnacle of all streaming, they have roughly about 65 million households. So it's unlikely that any of the others will achieve anything close to what Netflix is able to achieve in the United States, which is obviously the key market From an advertising perspective. you're completely right. The inventory is undifferentiated. In our case, it's very different. We skew male, 18 to 49, which is a highly coveted demographic, and most of our programming is sports related, And so advertisers love buying inventory and sports programming and drives brand recall and there's lots of Halo around it, So we're actually very well positioned as it relates to advertising. What about in terms of differentiating? like I'm sports betting or something I mean? ESPN is thinking about doing that. You walked away from that, but do you need that now, particularly for a demographic- is just so targeted to that area. It seems like sports betting is a no brainer. Yeah, sports betting is a no brainer. by the way, Everything that we've ever said or developed has been copied by all of these services: Our strategy for the sports stay for the entertainment or multi-view that YouTube has recently released, And you know we stepped away from betting. we were planning to do it another way when the markets started to turn against us, But you know, as part of the claim that we have, we have a significant number of restrictions that these programmers force us to comply with that they don't force their own services to comply with and give themselves a lot more flexibility. So this is one of the things that you mentioned that we would love to explore, because we think we can do a great job for our customers, Again leveraging all of the data and the capabilities that we have to drive a more personalized and premium experience. Can you continue to do that, David, Longer term as a standalone company? Well, you know, lots of companies have been able to succeed. Netflix obviously started a long time ago. Spotify has been able to do that successfully, I think, under normal competitive circumstances- just fair pricing- It's the only thing we would require- You would see a very different scenario because, as I said, we've been able to amass 1.6 million customers with a price that is higher than what YouTube TV offers, with 17 less channels. So how can a company like ours public four- or I should say, since our listing on the NYSE, you know, has exceeded guidance- 11 out of 12 quarters improved on the bottom line by about I think it's four quarters now in a row- has 17 fewer channels, a higher price and obviously very little margin to speak for. So, you know, my view is, once that happens and we can sort of play on the same playing field, equal footing. This is a company that can ramp up, I would say, relatively quickly. All right, David, thanks a lot. Super appreciate your time today. Thank you so much, CEO and co-founder David Candler, joining us And, as a reminder, we are out to Disney, Fox and Warner Brothers for comment on that lawsuit, But remain. you look at the stock, though: over Fubo. It's down about 8% today, but it's down about 47% since the high that it hit in December. Yeah, I mean, this is now about monetization and the idea that if they are stealing people or getting people, I guess, to gravitate from that sort of bifurcated system to a more aggregated system here, are they the beneficiaries or does they sort of maybe go to, I don't know, an aggregator like Warner Brothers Discovery, which I know they wouldn't call themselves that, but that's effectively what they've become. Yeah, Yeah, I honestly I can't keep track anymore of, like, who has what. what app has what, what sports team is where can you know? But you know that just means I just don't watch anything anymore. So you said, look at the wall, It's fair enough, But you know what? Yeah, You can always find Bloomberg, You can always find we have our own app. It's right there, It's amazing And you can watch us every day. All right, Let's turn now to some breaking news. we had earlier in the day Bloomberg learning that boeing is in talks to acquire Spirit aerosystems, a move that would reclaim control of its struggling former aerostructures unit and the main supplier at the center of quality issues affecting the 737 max airliner. Bloomberg intelligence senior analyst, George Ferguson, joins us now. Hey, George, gain this out for me: What happens with this over the next six months? I mean, I don't think it's going to take that long, And I would think that Boeing could strike a deal that would have spirit purchased in the next month or so. And you know, right now the CEO of Spirit is a gentleman by the name of Shanahan. He was a former Boeing executive. I don't think. I think Boeing's already there on the line and they just have a lot more of a presence at Spirit, our systems- And they'd be in the room when it's time to make decisions about things that do impact quality, And so I think that's the big change- is just having a very direct reporting line on on issues about manufacturing. Well, I get that in theory, George, but haven't they been in the room on these decisions already, Haven't a lot of the decisions, at least the ones that have impacted this company, been decisions that have been made less on the Spirit Aerosystems side and more on the Boeing side already? Well, I mean, I think that Boeing has absolutely influenced the decisions, and you know, to date, but they haven't been there to implement them or Spirit's been implementing them on the line, And so I do think it takes on a different complexion. I think it takes on, you know, maybe a higher sense of urgency. I think it takes, you know, the employees know that they ought to be answer in the Boeing in a straight line, not through spirit management. So that eliminates ambiguity. I do. I do think it's a positive. But I agree with you, Boeing's already had a lot of influence in this company. Yeah, Did two wrongs make a right? Does a have a wrong and a full wrong? or some right make a right? Hey, George, thanks a lot. We appreciate it. Best analysis there on the St George Ferguson at Bloomberg Intelligence. Let's stick with M&A but go to tech right now. Our next guest expects the positive momentum will continue here in the studio with more As Ted Smith, a partner, co-founder and president of Union Square Advisors, which has helped more than 175 deals valued in excess of 29 billion, And you're probably really happy. we're not asking you about spirit and buying. Yeah, okay, Tech M&A- what can we expect, and where? in the tech space, I think we're going to see a certainly a better year this year than we saw last year. Last year was sort of the year to forget. in tech M&A, we're seeing a lot of positive momentum, both from corporate buyers as well as private equity buyers that fuel the space. Certainly can't watch this show or any other news show and not talk about AI, So we're certainly seeing a lot of activity around AI, But what's most interesting to me is how quickly we've gravitated to the use of AI for real enterprise use cases. So things that are actually going to help the CFO, things that are going to help the general counsel, things are going to help senior executives do their jobs better, make their companies more efficient, Right, So we're seeing a lot of investment interest in that. So is the investment interest, though, in the providers of those AI tools or the beneficiaries of those AI? Well, the interest right now is in the providers of those tools, and that's certainly where we spend our time. Yeah, So talk about it. I am curious, though, about the end user meaning. I mean I'm talking primarily come from the corporate side, not not for individual consumers here. Have we reached a stage here where the adoption or the interest on the corporate side is enough to sustain, I guess, some of these sky high valuations and, more importantly, some of the sky high expectations that investors have? I think the valuations are still sky high and we have to grow into those over time. But there are real companies that are using real large language models, real AI, to do things like analyze conversations in a medical setting, to get to better outcomes for patients, to help the general counsel review a raft of contracts and understand where are the risks for the business. Those things are actually in companies today. They're being sold into those enterprises and there's real value to be had in those. Whether they'll grow into an open AI like valuation, that remains to be seen. The bid ask spread. Where is it? Are we reaching a happy medium here? Who's the holdout? I think right now we are. we up for a long time and I would say that 2023 was characterized by the holdout. on the seller's parts. They were still stuck in 21,- early 22 valuation land. Most of the buyers quickly adjusted to the 23 realities. It took a while for the sellers to come back around. Now I think we're much closer, and it's certainly one of the reasons we're seeing more activity. How much of this will provide private equity with an exit that they may not have had before? Well, it's interesting because, while we're certainly seeing activity on the IPO front right, lots of news around Reddit and others, we don't forecast a significant resurgence in the tech IPO environment. It just takes you have to be such a large company now to become public and to want to be public. So the real private equity exits are more likely sales to strategics or sales to other private private equity. Well, that's what I'm curious about. Do we even need that path? We actually need, But is that pathway to the IPO, as important as it may have been- I don't know- five or six years ago, when there were fewer options for an exit? That's exactly right. I don't think we needed as as robust. More to the point, we've ripped out a lot of the system that will allow those middle sized companies to trade effectively. Right, So you're either a large public company or you're private. I am curious, though, for those companies- the private companies that maybe see a path for investors that doesn't involve an IPO. does that change their management approach or, more importantly, how you as an investor, Advise them on how they manage the business? It really doesn't, because the reality of the statistics behind it, the data, show that for a venture backed company that gets to an exit, more than 95% of the time that's through a sale. So that's been true for many years. So it doesn't really change the dynamics of how you manage it. It may change the dynamics of which ones you think could get public in the current environment. All right, Great to have you here, Ted Smith, over Union Square Advisors, A closer look here at the tech landscape And I guess maybe, Alex, a pathway not to an IPO but certainly into an exit. Yeah, I guess you have to wonder what the regulatory backdrop is going to look like And some deals, like you make an argument like let's announce it now, wait out the clock and see if something different happens mid-November of this year, as you get sort of a changeover maybe in the government. Yeah, I mean out the clock there, Yeah, but in the meantime we just have to get Social media site Reddit going But coming up here we're going to take a look at a stock that's already in the public domain, though not necessarily doing well: New York Community Bank Corp. sliding here More of the internal issues rattling the market That's coming up next, after the break, It's our stock of the hour right here on Bloomberg. Huge week ahead in politics: on March 5th It's Super Tuesday and former President Trump is looking to cement his place as the Republican nominee. Then, two days later, as the border, the economy and the November elections dominate the headlines, President Biden will deliver his State of the Union address. Balance of power, as Joe Matthew of Kailey Leinz and Bloomberg's top political analysts will bring you live global coverage of both events. starting Tuesday, March 5th. Bloomberg Context changes everything. All right Time now for our Stock of the Hour Taking a closer look at the shares of New York Community Bancorp falling today after the regional bank flagging material oversight and how it tracks loan risk, The CEO out new leadership here as they try to grapple with the turmoil. Investors heading for the door. Abigail Doolittle joining us right now for a little bit more on this. And, Abigail, we'd be remiss in not pointing out we're just a few days away from the one year anniversary of the Sjb collapse back in March of last year Here. I know this isn't quite a repeat of that, but still kind of jarring to see that the regional banking crisis still apparently had not been resolved. Yeah, that's a great point, because it seems to be ripple effects in some ways, even though this is fairly different in the fact that they are saying, as you mentioned, that the oversight relative to the loans that they've made- well, it really just wasn't so great. They weren't assessing risk appropriately. Now the good news around it is they're saying that their 2023 results aren't going to be affected. They're also saying that the loan loss provisions relative to 2023 aren't going to be increased, But relative to the future, we don't know, because a big portion of it is commercial real estate, So that, of course, is under pressure, with not great occupancy relative to office and then rising rates. Now they, of course, have a big portion of their portfolio in rent regulated apartments right here in New York City. now The risk to this is a lot of. those loans were made when rates were, when Alex got her mortgage at like 1% or half a percent. Now it's 5%, 6%, So the cost of capital really comes into question. One other good thing is the fact that liquidity, well, is good and bad. Last, we knew liquidity was decent in February, but they clearly admitted what their deposits were now, which, if it was good, you would think that they would include that. So I should actually backtrack and say we don't know about their liquid. And also, of course, New York changed the rules back in 2019 for rent controlled apartments, So usually you'd go in, you'd buy em, you fix them up, you rent them for more, But now there's a cap, and that's where we really cap their profitability. What's interesting, though, is, if you take a look at going forward, you know they were hailed as being awesome because they rescued some assets from a signature, And I wonder if regulators are going to be like: let's rethink what awesome means and what banks can actually take on other areas of distress from other banks. It's a great point, Alex, because one of the big problems for this bank is the fact that they did acquire Signature Bank and other banks, So they went above 00 billion in assets, having nothing really to do with the rent regulations, but the regulation on them period is much bigger, So there's much more stringent controls relative to New York Community Bank and any banks with assets over 00 billion Now relative to whether we're going to see this come out into other banks, The top 25 regional banks. they have about 13% commercial loans And I'm told that that the stress is pretty manageable for them. But the smaller banks- we could see more blowups. About 44% of the commercial real estate loans are owned by those smaller banks. So it's an interesting mix of like a little bit of idiosyncratic here with New York Bancorp And then the broader picture. I was speaking to somebody, a big time New York developer, actually a national developer who will be speaking to in a few weeks, And he was saying he doesn't think it's going to be as bad as expected because banks don't want these assets. They're going to try to work it out to the best of their ability. But if you have a bank in this position who may not be able to work it out, then it kind of creates a double whammy. Right, And again you saw the rent stabilized issue. Wedbush had a cool note out that just sort of said: here are the other banks that had that New York rent regulated market. All right, Abigail, thanks a lot. We really appreciate that. But the thing is with shareholders and with the company, like they knew that that happened. That was 2019, right, Like that shouldn't have come as a surprise on top of that. So it is a surprise to me Why it's such a surprise. Yeah, And I don't know if it was a surprise. I mean we had seen the softness there. but I think when we go back what I was using- the help that they did do a last year I think bought them some time- There are a lot of people I think they look at first the public and say maybe that's the one They should have put a lot of more help into. Yeah, All right, Well, coming up, we are talking to Michael Couture Gugino, president, portfolio manager over permanent. This is Bloomberg. This is the countdown to the close: Romaine Bostick alongside Alix Steel: 10 minutes until we get to those bells. Alex, And remember, earlier this week you said it was a nothing burger. Well, guess what? The market as well is something burger. I don't know is not quite. I don't know if this is really a strong rally, but I think some people will take it. I mean, no, fair enough, And like it's definitely tech driven in some areas. Right, Like NetApp is doing really well, Dell's at a record- like, fair enough, Like they have, And that's a broadening of the rally. Those are nice good burgers. But on the flip side let me point two things. At one, Apple really seemed to be breaking down miraculous the session but were under 180 and that was that level. Well, we might see some shorts coming on. And then check this one out: The gambling stocks. when you also have Las Vegas Sands, Macao gaming revenue disappointed and January Las Vegas strip gambling revenue fell almost 4%. really wasn't at the Super Bowl time. that was supposed to be like gambling for everybody. I thought so too. Interesting move there. But also I mean, maybe there was such a run up in those stocks in anticipation of the Super Bowl being there You get a little bit of a pullback, but definitely some softness in those are those Macao number that I was kind of seeing. Yeah, Here, we do want to say here in the US as we countdown to the closing bell, with 9 minutes to go, Michael Fujino joining us right now. president and portfolio manager at the Permanent Portfolio Family of Funds. Mike, great to have you here on the program And I mean I'm sure you've seen the market action for the first couple of months of the year which I think defied a lot of expectations, a pretty strong market, at least here in the US, And Mark, just kind of starting off on the same foot. Are you buying it? We're not buying it, but we are enjoying the positions that we are on And we've actually trimmed a little bit as well into some of the the highs and some stocks, even ones we like- like in in video, for example, And so you know, I think the story for equities is strong, but they're not cheap, And and if the Fed is darned, if they're going to cut rates soon, that's a good argument for stocks. If there's a soft landing or, you know, landing or whatever, That's also a good argument. And there's a lot of energy around technology and artificial intelligence, especially for companies that are disappointing, And so I think that's been the big driver this week. Well, let's talk a little bit more about that, Michael, because I mean, I know a lot of folks out there are still looking for opportunities And, as you said, not a lot is cheap, but that is clearly what people are looking for. Maybe they find it in the small and mid-caps, Maybe you could find that in the big caps. Do you find it anywhere? Well, I would argue that maybe they say they're looking for cheap stocks, but they're actually buying the ones that are pretty expensive. But but you know that is there's a reason for that, though I mean I joke. but these are the companies that are growing earnings and revenues and cash flows- that at a tremendous clip, And so it makes sense that investors are going to be attracted to some of those names And, interestingly enough, the names that have disappointed. you know, you look at Snowflake earlier in the week, you look at Palo Alto Networks recently. companies that have disappointed have been punished, And so it does make sense in a in a certain way that investors are going to where they are. But but the sort of consolidation that we've seen, I don't believe is healthy in the longer term And we do need some diversification and some broadening, And hopefully we continue to see that or start to see it more than we have so far. So, Michael, it's Garp, Great growth at a reasonable price. I feel like that's the Holy Grail for everybody. Where do you see that potential? the most I see it in areas that aren't running up, to be honest. But we're long term investors and we're looking out over, in some cases, a multi-year time horizon. So we would look at some of the areas, know some of the industrials, energy and commodities we think are are not. they have not performed that well And we think longer term that area has a lot of potential to it, especially if global growth resumes, The dollar comes off- It's almost decade highs- and supply demand constraints exist in an emerging growth situation globally. Those companies tend to also manage shareholder returns very well, with special dividends, regular dividends, buybacks etc. And so we think for patient investors with strong stomachs, that's an area that is a lot cheaper in many cases stocks, you know trading at below market multiples. Biotech would be another area, especially those that have cash to make acquisitions, and certain you know therapies that maybe they're not developing but can buy that capacity somewhere else. Amgen comes to mind as one of our holdings in that area. So there are opportunities But broadly speaking, we're not buying stocks right now because they're not cheap. but we are enjoying the names that we own in our asset allocation. our bonds cheap, They were cheaper yesterday, They may get cheaper in the future. but we again, as diversified investors- I mean we run a bond strategy specifically, as well as an equity strategy- but we also run our permanent portfolio, which is an asset allocation model, And so in that model. we're pairing up equity exposure with bond exposure and we've been finding value in shorter duration- investment grade corporates where you're getting nominal yields- five, six, seven, in some cases higher percent- We're not going out that far on the yield curve- and then extending duration And for the moment that makes sense. You know there's going to be a time to extend duration. Some firms have already tried to do that. I think we've been a little bit cautious on that because we still see some volatility in interest rates, whether it's the Fed, whether it's the uncertainty of the inflation picture which you know maybe having a tougher time going from 3% to 2% and maybe the Fed's going to be higher for longer. So at some point duration will want to be extended. We're not sure where. So we're playing it cautious and we're finding yields that work at staying pretty low in duration. How much confidence do you have right now, or certainty do you have right now, Michael, in your view about the pace of rate cuts this year? A big debate right now, not just whether the Fed will cut rates, how many times it will cut rates, but now, of course, some discussions about whether they'll cut rates at all. Well, it's hard to see a recession with, you know, sub 4% unemployment and consumer spending. I, I know it's out there And we actually do think some of the anecdotal information out there is is leading to a a really gradually paced move towards a slowdown. But But that's not, you know, baked in. it could change and so it's hard to see that sort of situation. So, with without a slowing down of the economy, whether it's aggressive or not, the Fed can afford to be patient and stay higher for longer and manage inflation. If it is stubborn, getting from the mid threes down to two, you can stay higher for longer and see what happens. If the economy does slow quickly or the pace pick ends up, then they can always cut. We think cuts are going to happen at some point, but we're not predicting that And, as a result, that's been a little bit behind our- you know- hesitancy to extend duration at the moment. Yeah, inflation could pick up again. You know, I don't, nobody's really knows, but oil prices are going up again. Oh, Alex, Oh, I know They're good. Yeah, Your number was pretty good. Yeah, It confirmed that inflation wasn't as bad as maybe the other numbers a week or two ago. Yeah, but you could easily, you know, energy prices go up. You've got global risk, geopolitical risk, that inflation may be getting stubborn for consumers and that means higher interest rates for longer. So you know you're out there. We don't know yet. All right, Michael, going to have to leave it there. Always great to talk to you, Michael Kors. You know they are president and portfolio manager at the Permanent Portfolio Family of Funds. as we count you down to the closing bell here on this Friday afternoon, about 2 minutes to go, Stick with us. We're taking you to the bell and beyond. Beyond the Bell. Bloomberg's comprehensive cross-platform Coverage of the US market Close starts right now. And right now we are 2 minutes away from the end of the trading day. Romaine Bostick, alongside Alix Steel, We're counting down to the closing bell and here they'll take us. beyond the bell. It's a global simulcast with Scarlet Fu, Carol Massar, Tim Stanwick, And welcome to our audiences across our bloomberg platforms: television, radio, originals, our partnership with YouTube here. A strong day this Friday, a strong week with stocks, Carol, at record highs, gold at record highs and Bitcoin having its best week in a year. Yeah, I don't know what that says. Risk on trade, I guess is kind of the net. net, right. Take a look at the semiconductor index, ISE. It's up for a second day in a row, rallying more than 4% today. That's after an almost 3% gain yesterday. So we continue to see that sector really on fire, if you will. this week alone And in the last, I actually feel like year to date here, easily, we spent a good portion of our 2:00 hour talking to Torsten Slok over at Apollo about his call. that I would say reverberated in the sense of a lot of people are talking about it, But if you look at yields and if you look at equities, not a lot of people are actually buying into his call that the Fed is not going to lower rates this year. But I think it does add to the chorus that there are a handful of people out there who say, okay, well, the next move from the Fed could be keeping rates where they are or in fact, making them higher. maybe making them higher, although some Fed officials have come out, John Williams notably, saying that he thinks that the Fed will end up cutting rates. What interests me, given the slow move up, the melt up in prices, is that volume is actually higher than the 20 day average. on a day like today, Typically when you see a melt up. you see, less involved participation And interesting, because Apple had a terrible day and it has been pretty terrible, but small caps breaking through that December high. So if we can really go without Apple, I think that could be quite interesting Remain. Well, we definitely did it, at least on a weekly basis for one week. here for an across the screen here on this Friday afternoon as we get the closing bells here in New York. the Dow Jones Industrial Average only finished the day higher by about 90 points or so, about 2/10 of a percent here on the day. On a weekly basis, though, it is going to finish in the red. The S&P 500 bucking that trend up about 8/10 of a percent on the day and about 1% on a weekly basis. The Nasdaq composite higher by about 183 points or more than a percent here on the day, And that's going to be good enough to lock in a 2% gain on the week. But let's go to it. We've been talking a lot about the broadening of this rally And you did get that once again on the day and on the week. The Russell 2000 up 4% here on the day, 3% gain logged on a weekly basis. All right, Let's get to back to the S&P 500.. Just looking a little bit deeper into the index and scarlette, Most of the names in the index higher today: 307 to the upside, 196 lower on the day. So really seeing some fairly broad based buying, if you will. certainly among the big caps, Yeah, broad based buying, but technology continues to lead the way. Take a look at the eye map and it shows technology leading the advance, up 1.8%, thanks to NetApp, among others. Energy stocks also getting a lift as WTI moves past $80 a barrel. You have 22 out of 23.. Big cap oil stocks: higher today Rates bring up the rear up 1.1%. And on the flip side, the weakness is really in the utilities, the financials and the consumer staples. All right, folks, let's get to some of the individual gainers, if I may, in the Friday trade, And let's start with. you know, a big business story, another corporate story that's been out there involving Boing. Boing Again, remember. it used to own a spirit Aerosystems. Now it's saying after spinning it out in 2005,. now it's saying maybe it could be in talks to buy it once again, according to those familiar with the story and the matter. So, that said, shares of Spirit aerosystems up about 15% in today's session. If so Boeing would reclaim control of that struggling former Aerostructures unit. It's also the main supplier at the center of numerous quality issues affecting Boeing: Max Jets, Boeing's most important generator of cash flow. We know that Max certainly program for Boeing All right, So that's an outperformer. Dell- certainly a big outperformer in today's session, Let's bring it up for you everybody. Just finishing off its high of the day That was 38% to the upside, finishing with about a 31% gain, soaring to a record options trading volume, hitting a record too as well. There's a lot of activity around this name. You know what the news was. We got it last night after the closed company reported better than expected sales and profit fueled by demand for information technology equipment to handle artificial intelligence work. So that has certainly been an outperformer there for them. Evercore, Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley- among those raising their price target on the company, Morgan also reinstating it as a top pick. that is Dell, And one more for you are Broadcom ticker. AVGO- Let's bring it up for everybody. That was an outperformer, up just shy of 8% in today's session. a top gainer in the S&P and the NASDAQ 100 B of A raising its price target on the stock to 1500 dollars a share from 1250 heading into earnings next week And they say any stock pullback to be likely short lived As investors look forward to its March 20th Investor Day. So watching out for that. But again that one big outperformer in today's trade. All right, Kels got the gainers, I'll do the decliners. Alex, you mentioned Apple not having so great of a weaker apple, having not so great of a year so far down- close to 7% this year So far. today, on a points basis, the worst performer in the S&P 500 was down as much as 1.9% earlier in the session, finishing that down by just shy of 1%. today down 6/10 of 1%. This after Goldman removed the stock from its conviction list. It did keep a buy rating on the stock. It did raise its price target from $223 to $232, but removed it from its conviction list along with Merck and Vertex Pharmaceuticals. It did replace them with Amgen, Moneycom and Vulcan Materials. and then New York Community Bank. We got to talk about this one. We had Herman Chen on from Bloomberg Intelligence a little earlier dissecting what this means for not just New York community Bank but also for the regional banks, and seems to be relatively contained at this point because of New York community banks exposure to rent regulated real estate. But shares finished. They're down by wow, more than 25%, closing at the lowest level going all the way back to 1997.. The company did say that it discovered- quote- material weakness in how it tracks loan risks, wrote down the value of companies acquired years ago and replaced its leadership all to as it's grappling with all of this turmoil. And finally, shares of Boeing. Carol talked about shares of Spirit Aerosystems moving higher on the day after that Wall Street Journal report. Shares of Boeing moving when that came out but then moving lower as the day went on, closing the day down about 1.8% on the news that it could be taking back control of Spirit Aerosystems. we're here, We get. take a look at the bond market- buying all across the curve. Let's call it a bulls steepen, our guys so basically went in pounding a steeper curve because there's more buying in the front end. I mean I might say that we did get a headline weaker fry ism manufacturing. maybe that's what started it. But then you had Governor Waller talking about that. the Fed could boost the share of short term treasuries. That was in a semi-annual monetary policy report and a panel on QE. You just the point is like they could buy more. That stopped and there are more buying coming in. Yeah, I know Be interesting to see just how much volume and volatility we see in the yield space. Of course, a lot of Fed speaking next week. Of course Jay Powell on Capitol Hill for that two day testimony here, Carol Massar And we talk about this idea that what's the market really going to be focused on now, with earnings season over And we still got a couple of weeks before we get to the next Fed meeting. Well, what they're going to be focused on is any clues that he gives in terms of you know, kind of not if, but when, that the Fed might think about cutting rates, although I really feel like the narrative is getting a little bit cloudy. Oh, you're doing it. Well, what are we doing? I'm just saying what's up Carol did? Carol did ask Torsten Slok about what to watch for next week with Jay Powell testifying, And he did say he thinks that he's going to come out more aggressive, more hawkish, because of what happened back in December in the way that we've seen markets rise since then. Look, he's trying to maybe rein in the markets a little. try to rein in the markets, But look, you reminded him, Carol, that the market is not the economy. Yeah, not just because markets are up doesn't necessarily mean the Fed needs to think differently about how it's going to cut rates moving forward. Well, it's a data dependent Fed And we know that investors are looking at what companies have told them And, at least for a couple of companies, there have been some alarming details about internal controls. That's never a good two words to hear in a company's earnings release And there's a great Bloomberg News story about this, about how, with the market warnings I remember, lifts one extra zero in its earnings report, generating this. You know there's a shortage of CPAs right now and perhaps that might be part of the story with these companies maybe not getting the right accounting under control. So is that my plan B? You guys get a CPA? Yeah, it's just my thing. I'd hire you as an account owner. I trust you Just don't have the extra zero, Alex. I mean you know my eyesight's great, Yeah, I mean. I mean the CPA story has been one that's been unfolding for a while, but then you look at some of the. I mean I can understand, like something like live, you make a mistake, that maybe that's because you don't have somebody there really, you know, crossing their eyes and dotting their teeth. But then what do you make of the lack of internal controls that I don't know? New York community Bank material leads to these other things. Like I feel like if we had 300,000 more CPAs, I still wouldn't have addressed that issue. But it raises the question as to what's really going on behind the scenes here. Is this about oversight? Is this about internal controls, or is this about the fact that our standards are- and I mean the royal we hear the standards in the market right now are just a lot lower. at least they had been for years. the standards in the market, What do you mean? the standards in the market or the standards within investors, are what? Yes, that's exactly what I'm talking about, because I actually feel like when things go wrong, that they work their way through rather quickly through the financial markets, whether it's material weaknesses or some concerns about accounting. You start, you see investors react right away, whether or not that they should. But I also believe this kind of goes right back to Powell, because no doubt he's going to be getting questions about New York Community Bank and some of the controls there and how it was kind of lauded as a savior for some, a signature, His assets, but now there's a material problem, So I would say that that definitely would come up. I don't know where to go. I just don't know where to go. Do you know that right now we don't have to stay home for five days anymore after Covid? Yes, With anyone doing that- I was one of me- I'm always out. I'm not for like weeks. with Covid states December, I was home for five days. I wasn't allowed back. All right, that's a wrap. guys, I don't know where to go with this. We're all thinking about Fed Chair Jay Powell next week. Love you all. All right, That's good. That's a wrap for our cross-platform coverage: radio, TV, YouTube and Bloomberg Originals. We will see you again Same time, same place. on Monday We continue our coverage right here on Bloomberg Television. Don't go anywhere. A lot more coverage coming up here, including a conversation with Marc Morial, the former New Orleans mayor, now the president and CEO of the National Urban League. That's coming up in just a second here on the close on Bloomberg. Welcome back to the clothes. I'm Scarlet Fu with Romaine Bostick. We saw a rally in both stocks and bonds to end the week. In fact, we have record highs for the S&P 500, the NASDAQ 100, the Nasdaq composite- not the Dow just yet- And, of course, big tech leading the way as well. It's actually green across the screen. You can see treasuries moving higher as well, The two year yield coming down to 4.5%, Lots of Fed speak and, of course, a weaker than expected. I manufacturing increasing bets a little bit that perhaps the Fed might start cutting rates in June. New York crude did get above $80 a barrel as well. Let's move on to individual names. I mentioned tech, certainly as a leader. NetApp, gaining almost 18%, or more than 18%, as a data storage company, had a beat and a raise Earnings report, even as corporate customers continue to aggressively monitor their spending. Spirit aerosystems, up by 15% on a report that its former parent and biggest customer, Boeing, may look to acquire it. Your community bank, down another 26% on the day after saying it found material weakness in how it tracks loan risks. And Dominion is the worst performer in the S&P 500, losing more than 6% after it gave an investor presentation which included a period without dividend growth, which, of course, is concerning for utilities which are very attractive for their dividend growth. Now, big picture, one reason why stocks and bonds ended the week with a bit of a lift is because of that soothing Fed speech. New York Fed President John Williams says he is expecting the central bank to cut rates this year Eventually. I do expect us to cut interest rates later this year. I think that makes sense. With inflation coming down and the economy being the better balance, We're going to move interest rates back to more normal levels. But really right now I don't. there's not a sense of urgency to do that, And that seems to be the narrative that we've heard from other Fed members as well. The question isn't if they cut, but how much they actually cut. We did actually hear a little bit earlier from Apollo's chief economist, Torsten Slok, who says, guess what? They may not cut at all. He cites a re accelerating US economy coupled with a rise in underlying inflation that will actually prevent any such move by the Fed in 2024.. Our next guest actually says that that is going to be the dominant conversation right now and probably for the rest of the year. Vanessa McMichael joining us, head of Corporate and Public Entity Strategy, Fixed and Fixed Income Strategy at Wells Fargo. Vanessa, great to have you back here on the program, And let's get right to it here. I mean, this is the parlor game right now on Wall Street and everywhere in between. Does the Fed cut, And if they do cut, how many times? are you in the camp- right now, at least based on what the market's pricing- in that We're still going to get 3 to 4 cuts this year. Well, thank you for having me back from Maine. So my colleagues on economics team here at Wells Fargo think that the Fed is going to cut their policy rate by 125 basis points this year, starting in May. If it doesn't happen in May, then then June looks to be the next opportunity there. So we're in the camp that the Fed does actually cut its target rate this year, although most of that cut, most of the easing, will be towards the back half of this year. I am curious as to just the general investment thesis for the fixed income space, because this has changed a lot pretty quickly. I mean, we went from a market just a few weeks ago that was eyeing 5 to 6 cuts And even if the Fed was trying to push back on that, they at least seemed to be dangling the possibility of 3 to 4 cuts this year. But based on commentary from other Fed members, it's not so much that they won't cut, but I don't know if we're going to get that. So do you change your and that vestment thesis with regards to duration and, more importantly, with regards to broader fixed income exposure? That's quite a question. remains, though: In my IT, my work, I interface with corporate investors and this conversation is obviously been a dominant conversation in markets, but it's been and it's been a conversation with clients, But it's more dominant this year in in the, in the sense that it's causing kind of a divergence in conversations. I'm seeing two camps with my corporate investors in one camp, because the Fed is saying, hey, we will remain higher for longer. We do plan to cut at some point this year, maybe not towards the second half of this year, but higher for longer is really sticking with clients. And so those corporate investors who are parking a lot of their cash- both core cash and strategic or excess cash- in money market funds, are comfortable staying there. They're very comfortable with rates still above 5%. They're expecting rates to remain at those levels for at least most of this year. And then in the other camp, I have clients who I think are waking up to the fact that we are heading into this easing cycle And maybe we do need to take some of that cash out of money market funds and place it elsewhere, because we saw at the end of December and throughout January of this year how fast rates can fall And so we don't want to miss that opportunity. Yeah, so it's time for them to make a decision, kind of a call on the bigger picture overall. But I'm wondering for your corporate clients who are holding their money in bank deposits: has all the issues at your community bank changed your behavior in any way? Has it raised alarm bells for them? So I wouldn't say this particular instance. I would tell you that one of the reasons why I think many corporate clients are still going to err on the side of holding probably more cash in money market funds- government money market funds- than they would historically are is because of the regional bank stress that happened just about 12 months ago. So that impacted some of my corporate clients and those that were not directly impacted. It was close enough for them to pay attention to wanting to make sure that they're making sure that they diversify their liquidity options, And so that's one of the reasons why I think this year, you know, despite what we're telling clients- to begin to think about moving some of that cash out of money market funds. some are going to hold hold hold that cash there because it seems like a safer option, All right, And that's going to have to leave it there. Always great to talk to you, Vanessa McMichael, over at Wells Fargo. Need to get to some breaking news crossing the wires. Carlo was just mentioning that Boeing story that Bloomberg broke earlier. People familiar with the situation saying that they are in talks to acquire spirit aerosystems. A press release now out by boeing confirming just that. it is short, It is terse: 113 words basically saying that they have been working closely with spirit aerosystems and they think that, in the interests of strengthening aviation safety and improving quality, they're recombining spirit aerosystems into Boeing would serve the interests of customers, employees and shareholders. We're going to try to get you some more details on that in just a bit. Yeah, it raises the question of why they split up to begin with, and I think that's a conversation worth having here, as they talk about how this would strengthen safety. All right, Let's get to what's coming up on the close: how companies and American government policies are addressing diversity and inclusion. We've got a conversation next with the president and CEO of the National Urban League. This is the close on Bloomberg. A broad swath of corporate America is tweaking the language used for regulatory filings to appear both politically and socially neutral. Companies including Bank of America, Delta and Uber are dropping terms like anti-racism, allyship and verbiage linked to diversity and inclusion. Simone Foxman is the co-author of Bloomberg's story on this And I guess it's kind of an effort to avoid controversy, isn't it? Yeah, that's right. Both avoid controversy and avoid potential litigation. because what's happened ever since, especially the Supreme Court decision on affirmative action, is that we have seen conservative political activist groups going out and suing companies for what they believe are stepping across the line and doing things that are, or could be, illegal based under the legal precedents. So what we've seen companies doing is essentially making their language a whole lot more vague and how they describe their diversity and inclusion efforts. They're changing things like recruiting, like hiring, to recruitment. So it's okay to maybe try and draw a broad swath of people, but not so much to say We specifically want to hire a lot of people of color or women or of other marginalized groups. So is this so? are they change? just changing the window dressing? and? but they're still doing this, or are they really pulling back actually on these initiatives altogether? So we went out to a lot of companies- There are about 20 on our list. Yeah, most of them that responded to us said we are still committed to diversity. There are changes at the margin, for example, citizens not having mandatory diversity training anymore. Those are just resources available, Yeah, but for the most part they say they're continuing to go forward with these diversity and inclusion initiatives. You know. the question mark is, though, if you start talking differently about this priority, how much does this change your actual behavior? All right, Simone Foxman, A closer look here at some of the DEI initiatives out there, And, while it may be the lack of initiative that's now seeping through corporate America, Our next guest who runs the National Urban League- and the National Urban League has been keeping track of these type of trends now for decades- Marc Morial is the president and CEO of the National Urban League out with a report here on the state of black America, And before we get to the details of that report, Marc, I do want to get your thoughts here on the news that Bloomberg is reporting, and other media outlets here, that that big groundswell and interest that we saw after the George Floyd murder is really just kind of- at least publicly- seem to have waned just a little bit here. I'm not pleased by it, to be quite honest, because it represents a step back or retrenchment from a commitment that's consistent with American values. Diversity, equity and inclusion is about equal economic opportunity And, on this, the 60th anniversary Of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Let's take note that neither you nor Samantha would be at Bloomberg before the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It has made a difference in America and it's consistent with American values. Notwithstanding that, what we want to encourage companies to do is to maintain the substance of their commitment to equal access to the American Dream and to not be intimidated by those who for some reason, want to turn the hands of time backward. So we stand ready, as many of us are, to work openly with American business in furtherance of this goal, And that's a laudable goal. But, as you know, this has now gone from just trying to convince people. this is a right thing. You have legal cases. You mentioned the Civil Rights Act, which, to a certain extent, really kind of got punched in the gut by the Supreme Court last year with that reinterpretation of Title seven. So where do we go here when we have a Supreme Court that's looking at this very act that you cite as our progress, And they're basically tell, telling us that that's somehow unfair to everyone else? Well, the point is is that many of those advocates, those conservative advocates, are conflating, distorting and mis interpreting the Supreme Court decision, which was about two universities: higher education programs, How many admissions programs do universities admissions programs? they are trying to distort, intimidate and bully. Look, they can bring lawsuits. We can bring lawsuits Right. It just has going to become a battle, a litigation, But what I think everyone should do is reaffirm their commitment to the principle And let's talk about the best way to achieve it. This is what the discussion should be all about. So, Mark and I'm troubled, Yeah, go ahead. I'm sorry to interrupt, but I just want to get some context for what you're saying in terms of where things stand right now, because I know the National Urban League has just published a 2020 for equality index. Can you give us the state of play of where things stand? Yes, So our quality index shows African-Americans indexing at 76% of where whites are when it comes to important social and economic statistics, And I'll give you an interesting example: 500 CEOs of the Fortune 500. Only six are African American Now. there was zero in 1964, but the highest paid, the best jobs in American corporate America are the CEO jobs. We've made some progress, but have we made enough? I'm paying to believe that the fact they are six constitutes some sort of quota or discrimination against any other race or any other people. So we've got to keep this in context. We've made progress, but we've not made enough And we're going to be in a fight for the soul of the country. We're going to be a fight to ensure that, you know, ultimately we achieve parity. So at the pace we're going, yeah, we would achieve parity 180 years. So, 60 years later, we've made progress and we made enough. know that we need to do more? Yes, So in that path to trying to create progress, we know that almost four years ago, companies went on a hiring spree looking for chief diversity officers. That has started to back off, as Romain had mentioned. you know, as companies shift away. But did that period where we had chief diversity officers, did that create any measurable change from where you sit? Very quickly here, I think that it demonstrated a commitment to diversity. It represented the fact that you had somebody who was going to work on strategy. It's like a chief technology officer. Can you have technology without a chief technology officer? Yes, What do you need the leadership? Do you need the expertise to design the programs, to follow through, to hold everyone accountable? Yes, you do, Which is why chief diversity officers and companies which deep diversity officers, and companies with diversity plans and to be the most profitable American companies. All right, Mark, we're going to have to leave it there. Great to talk to you, Marc Morial, president and CEO of the National Urban League. All right, When we come back after the break, we're going to take a look back at this day at history and a Titanic weekend at the Hollywood box office, And we leave you with the question, before we go to the break: What was what has been the highest grossing movie domestically here in 2024?? This is Bloomberg. All right, Let's sail back to 1998, where, on this day in history, Titanic extended its run atop the box office for an 11th straight week and it became the first film ever to gross billion in ticket sales. The love story turned disaster film would go on to gross more than $2 billion, a record that stood for more than a decade before being surpassed by well, another James Cameron film, Avatar, which to date has raked in almost $3 billion worldwide since its release in 2009.. But Hollywood has fallen far from those halcyon days of tentpole movies that really did nurture entire economic ecosystems for theaters, merchandisers, even television alike. There are about 53 Hollywood releases that have gone on to GROSS worldwide more than billion on a non inflation adjusted basis, And all but six of those were released before the pandemic, and five of those six were either sequels or extensions of existing film franchises. The actor and writer strikes have shut down Hollywood production for months. Last year didn't help matters To start off 2020, for the domestic box office has tallied just under $900 million so far, around 20% lower than the same period last year and 40% below 2019.. And to answer our question of the day, the highest grossing movie of the year so far? well, that belongs to TimothÃ©e. Timothee Chalamet Wonka, the Musical Yes, Scarlett, the musical reimagining of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, grossing more than $80 million domestically since its release in mid-December. And it is still the only film since the dual release in July of Barbie Oppenheimer to surpass $200 million. And that raises the question: what, if anything, will be 2024?? Barb and Heimer- several potential blockbusters have had their release dates pushed back to 2025 because of the strike. That includes Paramount's Mission Impossible, Pixar's Leo and Marvel's Captain America. One potential salvo does come today with the wide release of Dune Part two. Part one, released by Warner Brothers two years ago amid the pandemic, grossed more than $400 million worldwide. Strong early reviews for part two, along with an aggressive marketing campaign, has box office pro estimating the sequel could open with around $80 million in sales. Well, that would be the biggest domestic box office opening since Taylor Swift's era's concert film back in October, But at $80 million it wouldn't even rank in the top 100 of the biggest opening weekends of all time. In fact, it wouldn't even rank in the top 100 of the biggest opening weakening weekends of the past 24 years. Yeah, I think those records from the past 24 years are going to stand, given how fragmented the whole media landscape has become. All right, I want to move on now to next up, where we highlight the entrepreneurs and founders moving the needle for our economy, markets and technology. Venture Valley is a simulation game that captivates the hearts and minds of entrepreneurs in the making. It's popular among middle, high school and college students and it's a free to play game that helps users hone in on business skills and financial decisions. I'm pleased to say, joining us now is Shelly Miles. She is CEO of the Singleton Foundation for Financial Literacy and Entrepreneurship, which produces the game. Shelly, so good to speak with you. I know that the goal is to address one of the most pervasive problems out there, which is financial incompetence, and your game tries to build on those skills. What would you say is the single, most specific, single, most important financial skill that your game focuses on teaching? Well, what? what people? Scarlett, thank you so much. What people really get playing Venture Valley is they get to make the financial decisions in the businesses they're running, Whether it's a simple business like pet walking or something more sophisticated like a robotics factory. So they learn about the interaction between price and costs, What you do with competition and how to make real life decisions that are impacting your businesses and seeing how it all works. And can you give us a sense of who's partnering with you on this, Because this is a nonprofit firm? from where you stand, it's a free to play game. How are you funding all of this? So we've been very, very fortunate: The founders of the foundation, Will and Kerry Singleton. this is their foundation and they've been very generous with us. But we also work with a lot of partners, like we've worked with Discovery Education. we work with the Department of Defense, among others, And so it gives us an opportunity to reach a lot of people. where we start in a year, like when we talk about the age of the kids that get exposed to this, How young Shelly are we talking about? Well, it's really kids that are old enough to have to read. well, and so are some of our youngest players are 12 and ten and middle school, And it goes all the way up through college business students. So, you know, games aren't like some other products, It's more genres of games you play, Not so much age. Yeah, exactly. I am curious, though, about how much this tied with both your product but also competing products. How much do they get integrated into actual formal schooling curriculums, Because there's been a lot of talk about how a lot of school curriculums don't actually teach anything really related to finance or I guess what. in the old days we would call it home economics. It's just kind of leave these kids out there to to hang until they, you know, go out into the real world and basically have to figure it out on their own. Well, we're seeing a lot of it. So, when it, through our partnership with Discovery Education, we were able to reach around 800,000 students in classrooms with a curriculum that wrapped around it, And we're starting to see adoption by some of the universities, with Venture Valley, So most recently Seton Hall, what with the classrooms- and I'm not the college, but below that, Are we talking about public schools? Are we doing? are these private schools, charter schools? What It's? it's all across the board. Okay, Can you give us a sense of the take up of the game? What kind of numbers are you seeing? So, right now, I think we have about 250,000 players and we're well on our way to getting to a million. Well, on your way to getting towards a million. You talk about how it really lays the foundation for people learning how to run a business and how to budget for it and how to think through some of the steps. What about investing? Is that something where you see a need to educate the youth? Yeah, and there's, there's many programs that do that. So that's not the focus of this game, but it's this really important: skills. That's part of the financial competence side of our mission, which is both promoting entrepreneurship and financial competence, Mm, hmm, How are you tracking, I guess, the longer term success Meaning? is there a way to sort of look at the kids that are using these tools and using these curriculums here and how they perform once they do become adults? I mean, do you get any feedback that gives us a sense here as to whether they really are prepared? You know, it's interesting. We just did some research with do a bit research and we and we hit two of our goals with the game, which was we wanted young people to be able to imagine themselves as successful entrepreneurs, And we found that of the college students that we surveyed, that over 80% of them said that they could imagine themselves as entrepreneurs. in a similar number said they really learned the cause and effect of business. But the game hasn't been out that long, so it's hard to tell the long term effects. We had one student who followed our college tournaments around the country and he just got funding for his own business and he said that the game really helped him understand quick decision making and pivoting in the things that you have to do in the real world reacting to market forces. But we'll have to wait and see what the really long term effects are. Well, Shelly Miles, when you do get that data, we'd love to hear about it. Thank you so much for joining us. Shelly is CEO of the Singleton Foundation for Financial Literacy and Entrepreneurship. Remain, I feel like a follow up game here could be something on teaching kids about these budding entrepreneurs, about government regulation and taxes, because that's the next step. Oh gosh, I don't know. I mean, along with that curriculum have to be But, but you are right And and I do think about I mean I was fortunate to go to a relatively good primary school and secondary school where they did teach and stuff, But so many kids, yeah, they just. we had a whole generation that's never got this. Yeah, absolutely. And, of course, with you know everything turning To technology and relying on technology, A lot of it, you don't have to think through anymore, Right, It just kind of appears for you. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, All right, Let's take a look at how markets closed on the day. Speaking of you know literacy and financial literacy, you had record highs here for the S&P, the NASDAQ composite, the NASDAQ 100 index, big tech certainly helping to lead the charge, although Apple was not a participant there- And also buying across the Treasury curve as well. Right, We didn't get any real new economic data, but a little bit of more levity when it comes to the outlook for rate cuts. Yeah, it'll be interesting to, like you know, when we kind of get into this phase where there's a little bit less news flow, and how investors interpret that. I think the bottom of your screen, though, is interesting to me as well, because we've actually seen commodities really perk up. At one point, WTI crude did reach 80 bucks, and we had gold closing at a record high, both the futures and on a spot basis, and even the Buycom index as a whole. I think it was like something like the second best week since, like October or something. So I don't know what that says, But I do think it's interesting to see that what was a dormant area, the market, now seems to be waking up, So you could call a broadening of the rally, where you could call it something that perhaps might lead to more inflation. We'll find out. This is the close on Bloomberg. All right, An optimist Guide to the Planet. That's the hit new Bloomberg original show that you really need in your life. The latest episode is out, and it focuses on farming and how one group of friends took an abandoned area in Cleveland, Ohio and transformed it into a positive force for the community. Cleveland, Ohio, was the number one epicenter in the country for the foreclosure crisis. It was anticipated that 10,000 homes will be demolished- turned out to be 18,000 homes that were demolished- Wow. I beg the question: what are we going to do with all this vacant land? Because this is not representative of my Cleveland. I don't want to see this in my town. Wouldn't it be nice to repurpose some of it for things like urban farms, so that people can have jobs? You could bring life back to neighborhoods, huh. So my two childhood friends got excited and so we- sort of super friends unite, kind of came together and said: Let's see what we can do. Keema and myself grew up with a third co-partner, Damien Forte, who suddenly passed away in 2018 from a heart attack. We had the street named in his honor. East 80 seconds. See, it's Damian Forte way. How big is it? How big is? We started, Nicola, with 1.3 acres, Just a space that you see behind him. We have now expanded to all the space behind us- A total of 18 acres. Wow. So it took us 12 years to get to this point. You did say you had to clean this whole place up. It was contaminated. How bad was it? Well, we did have the soil tested when we first got here And it had high levels of lead and arsenic and all sorts of other really nasty things. Wow, We have to show that these places matter and that we can do something dramatic to change the the community in a positive way. And you were just listening there to Nikolai Costa Waller, the host of the Bloomberg's Optimist Guide to the Planet here, and Randy McShepard, the co-founder of Read All Green Partnership. He joins us right now to talk about this initiative. And, Randy, I mean, you know community gardens aren't necessarily new, but 15 acre community gardens on a site like the one that you guys broke ground on, that had been a huge project, And I am curious as to how much help, if any, that you got from the city or the state. Well, thank you for having me First of all, excited to be here. We didn't get much help early on from the city other than identifying the lot that we ultimately started the urban farm on. We were looking for 1 to 2 contiguous acres and the city told us that there really weren't any spaces outside of this one particular area that was known as the Forgotten Triangle and it had many acres that were contiguous, but it also had burned out cars, refrigerators, you know, thousands of tires and other types of trash And they sort of said: you can have it if you're willing to invest and we'll be required to turn it around in the way that you all are hoping to do. So once we got started we started to get a bit more support from the city, But by and large this has been an entrepreneurial endeavor where we have written personal checks, we have raised money from foundations, corporations and even some of our own social enterprises. So the things that you're growing there, Randy, is there sort of income from that or is this just all sort of being given to the community? No, We certainly, by design, want to grow produce that we can actually earn income from We we, from the very beginning, made the decision that the only way we would sustain the Rural Greening partnership was to find ways to generate revenue. So we grow 3500 to Â£4000 of produce each year that we actually sell at a farmer's market that we purchased about a year ago. We sell some of that produce at our location. We have a restaurant at our location that we sometimes, you know, source for not only restaurant activities but catering activity. So it all goes back into the coffers, if you will. And yeah, it's been quite successful. It sounds like a virtuous cycle, which is kind of what you want to encourage. I'm curious in terms of what kind of unexpected benefits have come out of this partnership. What have you noticed that surprises, surprises you? Yeah, that's a great question. There are so many wonderful things that have come from this. First of all, people being excited about the possibility, the potential of the urban poor, of distressed neighborhoods that people thought could never come back. This area was called the Forgotten triangle. No one ever went there. It was a notorious illegal dumping site. We've had five weddings take place since. we've turned this place around. We have a big event every year called Fest Festival, where last September, on one day, we had 9000 people come for food, live entertainment, vendors. you know, fellowship, those kinds of things, The excitement that schoolchildren actually experience when they come. We have about 3500 students from various public, private and parochial schools come for tours. A lot of the teachers look at us and say we never thought that we'd be bringing kids to this neighborhood for this kind of an upward learning opportunity. So all of those things are big surprises to us. The fact that we've been able to sustain for 13 years and continue to grow- Yeah to the original question- even generate enough revenue to kind of keep the organization vibrant, All of that has been a surprise to us. So I want to go back to the question that remained for a statue, which was the kind of government support you got- at least it wasn't there initially. What does it look like now and what kind of outreach have you gotten from mayors of other cities? We've had just a handful of mayors from other cities visit over the years. Certainly, our current mayor, Justin Biggar, has been very supportive. He's been down at our farm on some occasions just to go and have six months. He's very focused on climate and sustainability and those kinds of things, So he sees us, as you know, partners in the work that he's trying to do. We have not received much from the state, with the exception of the Isle. Farm Bureau has been supportive. They like to send people to us for training and we do have. we're currently working with three other cities for what they call a conservation innovation grant, which is a USDA grant where we're actually trying new farming practices that can improve the field as a whole. But outside of that it's been primarily corporate funders, philanthropic organizations or individuals and earn revenue. And so- and you have- you have other folks reached out to you meaning, like other folks who want to start something similar to read, all basically looking at what you did and maybe potentially using it as a template. Yes, we have had probably since inception. we started doing our five month commercial urban agriculture training about 11 years ago and we probably had 7 to 800 people go through that training, many of them from other states outside of Ohio or other parts of Ohio. We do get occasional random requests for people to go through and then want to maybe see our business model. And then, locally, we have actually a contract with our county government where we're helping neighborhood folks identify vacant land and learn how to acquire the land And then we get sort of give them a jumpstart with getting things like soil and getting the land cleaned up and, you know, building a house and things like that. So we really want to promote the whole concept of urban agriculture. We think it's a viable business opportunity and can really help urban core communities that are distressed, Yeah, All right. Well, Randy, a lot of eyes on you right now. A lot of eyes on Cleveland, a great city that's seen better days, But obviously they got some great people still there really helping to build it back. Randy Shepherd, Riddell Green partnership co-founder. you can find him in the latest episode of An Optimist Guide to the Planet. You can catch that on the Bloomberg app, Bloombergcom, and right here on Bloomberg Television. All right, A lot of potential market moving events coming up over the next week. We're going to set you up for what to watch. Stick with us. This is Bloomberg And And a lot of potential market moving events over the next week. And a lot of those potential market moving events could come out of Washington. Voters from 15 states and one US territory heading to the polls for the Super Tuesday presidential primaries And the current president, Joe Biden, set to deliver his State of the Union address on Thursday. Bloomberg's Tyler Kendal joining us right now, not from Washington, but here in Studio two. Great to have you here in New York. I do want to start off with that State of the Union address, a critical one in an election year. What's the message that Biden is going to deliver? Yeah, definitely remain. A White House official tells Bloomberg News that we should expect President Biden to really focus on the economy in the speech. That's likely going to look like touting some past accomplishments, like legislation like the CHIPS and Science Act or the bipartisan infrastructure bill, But that official also told us that we should expect some tangible plans when it comes to hiking taxes on the wealthy and also corporations. Now, they didn't give us too many details, but we do know. for example, President Biden's been on the campaign trail saying that he would like to see a hike to the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%, So that's something that we're definitely going to be looking out for. There could also be some bipartisan proposals here, such as lowering prices for prescription drugs. That's something that the White House has been really trying to tout, And they know, and our polling is showing us- that this is something the White House is having a hard time breaking through on. when it comes to voters, Our most recent Bloomberg News morning console poll, for example, shows that he's really trailing former President Trump when it comes to voter confidence and handling the economy. Okay, So that's a wish list. when it comes to the State of the Union, Voters are going to head to the polls for primaries on Tuesday. Nikki Haley is actually still in the race, which is kind of hard to believe given how much she's fallen behind the former president- Definitely. And so Super Tuesday, like you said, there's going to be 15 states in. about a third of the delegates needed for the Republican nomination are going to be up for grabs. We've been crunching the numbers and that magic number is going to be 1215.. That's how much you need to secure this nomination, And while former President Trump won't have enough, after Super Tuesday, our numbers are projecting that he could be very close to getting to that number. Of course, like you mentioned, Nikki Haley still in the race. today She announced a 2 million campaign fundraising. All right, Tyler Kendall there with the nice preview of what to expect, And be sure to tune in here for Bloomberg. We're going to have full coverage here of Super Tuesday. Meanwhile, we push ahead to some of the other big market moving events that are going to occur over the next week here, And a big one here is going to involve Jay Powell on Capitol Hill. He's going to be speaking to Congress. I'm almost certain he's going to be asked questions about New York community banks and what that means with regard to the concerns about regional banks and how safe they are. Yeah, of course we also are going to get that State of the Union address which we were just talking about, But really I think we have to jump forward to Friday, Scarlett, because you get a big economic data point that is going to really maybe shape not only this man's future in the White House, but of course also Jay Powell and what he has to do. Right, And, of course, all the headlines from a lot of the tech companies over the earnings season has been job cuts, So we're going to see how that actually shakes out, how that plays out in the official numbers. Yeah, of course, that jobs monthly jobs report coming on Friday 8:30 am on Washington time, And we still got a quite a few earnings to sift through, including some tech that actually have some material impact on the market. Yeah, certainly Target's going to be something that everyone watches for. It's an alternative to Wal-Mart. But you know, Abercrombie Fitch got my attention because Dana Telsey was telling us that shopping there now too, I thought this was like a teen retailer. Now it's just all middle aged women shopping there. They've grown up with their customers. I mean, Oh, you mentioned it, All right. Well, don't worry, We'll be back next week with full coverage of all those earnings, full coverage of Jay Powell and full coverage of everything going on in Washington. Stick around A lot more coverage of what's going on in Washington Up next on balance of power. this has been",[239]

Not much Cash- comes with a message from Warren Buffett. It does indeed that there could be a significant opportunity ahead. But before we get to that, let's break down what we have going on with the stock, because it is up for an eighth day in a row- the longest winning streak going back to April of last year, plus opening at a record high. So investors are really liking what they see. And it's not just about that cash pile, It's also about the fourth quarter operating earnings of $8.48 billion ahead of last year by 28%. That's tremendous growth. Last year that that number came in at 6.63%, or $6 and 6.63 billion, excuse me- And it was helped out by an increase in insurance earnings and investment income amid higher interest rates and milder weather. Now, as for that cash pile, what we're talking about here is massive $167.6 billion. And, yes, Warren Buffett saying that this is amid a drought in deals. If that changes, he essentially said if there are more deals, the firm would have a shot at- quote, unquote- eye popping performance. Well, given the fact that this is a behemoth already: 28% growth- that's already eye popping. So it will be interesting to see what that could mean. And interesting not just the record high- Manny's also inching to that $1 trillion market cap.",[6]
201,cMrpsp5_0FQ,Big AI Ambitions at Apple After Scrapping Car Plans,Bloomberg Television,2024-03-01 16:41:06+00:00,"Within Cupertino. The next big thing I think comes out WWE DC. I mean, obviously Gurman breaking this story. They ripped the Band-Aid off on TV, but now it's all focused on AI. We believe the App Store, a separate app store, will be the first step And I think for developers that's important because for consumers, they're going to be able to now, over the next one, two years, be buying separate AI driven apps off of an iPhone 16 that has exclusive AI capabilities in homes built in. This is the next phase of the growth story within Cupertino. So, Dan, I mean I think what we've seen- and you've certainly explained it to us very well over the years- that Apple doesn't feel the need to be first, Even in iPhones, for example, they just need to come in with the best and most elegant product. Is that kind of the strategy we're seeing with either? Certainly not First. they're certainly not leading edge. but do you fully expect them to have a play here, an angle? Look, I mean there's 2.2 billion reasons. I mean that's the amount of iOS devices. for them, They don't have to be first because they have a golden installed base. that's unrivaled. Then, really, right now, I mean, sentiment is negative on Apple out there And I believe what the street's missing is going to be this renaissance of growth, not just a tie into the Apple ecosystem by the is going to spawn just more and more upgrade opportunities as we go into next 12,, 18 months, And that's. that's going to be huge for the sum of the parts you're keen talked about in video and Microsoft, but now it's second, third, fourth derivatives of this revolution that hit. So, Danny, you're in Asia as we speak. What's the feeling there about China and Apple and, as an end market for Apple products going forward there? Because, as you are, Well, that's probably the big issue for the stock right now. Yeah, Earlier this week in Hong Kong and in around China, it's a. it's like the, the, the video thriller, the negative, the harsh right in terms of the view right now of China attack and, I think, fears about just the economy in China. I think when you look at Apple, it all comes down to what is demand look like in economy, like that We believe to that point it has started to stabilize. I believe the street's factoring in a lot more negative than we're seeing here. I think the overall senator right now is basically anything but China And you own US tech, the air revolution. No one wants to be outside the bar at 10 pm when it goes to four. and I'm talking Paul Sweeney on this, And then we're going to go to Dana. I want to hear from both you on this. There's got to be a point where operating officers of any visible company just get angry. Yeah, In the CFO, turns to the CEO and says, look, remodeling this out the next 18 months, Paul Sweeney, let's do it now. is that Apple is now Paul, I, you know, I think, for for China and Dan, I'll go to Dan on supply for China, it's 20% of their sales, It's a huge part of their infrastructure. They have to be there that Tim Cook is over there all the time trying to make it work here. So, Dan, I mean, is there a scenario where China is not really, you know, a critical market for Apple? I mean, it's the heart and lungs of apple in Germany, but, of course, from a supply perspective, And that's that's the reality And I think Apple recognizes you have 200 million iPhones in China. They've gained some market share the last 18 months just because of what they're going through. They're not throwing in the towel. What did come on the CFO that they got? Nobody's got a profit machine like Apple. Let's start with that basic summary here. There's almost a point where, this put on Apple, They go enough and do something financially to right the ship. Is that feasible? Look, I think anything's possible. In other words, like all options are on the table in terms of where they can navigate things, And for Apple right now they are in just a massive position of strength because of the installed base, And I think they recognize Cook Hill. they'll navigate headwinds in China Again to the other side is because of what's on the horizon. It's start with the vision, So then it's a app store and then I within I can get one more in here. can I state off the screen on the Bloomberg terminal: The return on invested capital for this dog of Cupertino is 55%. I've never said that number of folks in umpteen years. exact, Hey, Dan, real quickly. what's the prognosis here on Apple's decision to back out of the car business? I think that was just Brian. was the raw data ripped, the Band-Aid off, focused on a mouse, a decade lost. but for them you can't keep putting good money after bad. They got to focus on a. this is no different than Zuckerberg in better. you know, taken away from metaverse going toward a smart move. they need to do it and look, it was a. it was a painful learning lesson, I think, for Cook.",[1]

The Indian conglomerate that is the lens will hold at least 61% stake in the most entity, with the rest going to Disney. But the final figures that excite break up will be no closer to completion of the merger because it depends upon how certain assets of Disney are treated in this merger, The key one of the case in point being the stake that Disney holds in a company called Tata Flavor. The reliance will get that or not. So we will know the exact breakup closer to completion of the merger And the announcement is being expected by Wednesday. So how will the transaction impact India's media landscape? This is a binding agreement and it will take at least a few months for the transaction to complete. Once that happens, then the most entity will hold, or will have at least or will control more than one third of the media and entertainment market in India. So obviously a big threat or big challenge to other competitors, like other rivals like Z, Netflix or Sony. So we are expecting a lot of consolidation to happen in the segment after this And a lot of the competition will have to change their strategies to match up to the most entity.",[32]
203,4WRXC4O1-GM,PeltzÂ Publishes â€˜Restore the Magicâ€™ Plan for Disney,Bloomberg Television,2024-03-05 20:44:26+00:00,"Nelson Peltz is out with a manifesto for change over at Disney. Here it is. It's a 133 page white paper entitled Restore the Magic at the Walt Disney Company. It was released on Monday and in it, helps us try and fund. management cemented its demands for an overhaul of Disney's board as well as a recasting of its business strategy. Bloomberg's Chris Palmeri has more from LA. So, Chris, a lot of demands here, some of them familiar, including adding Nelson Peltz and the former Disney CFO, Jay Fasulo, to the board, along with coming up and putting in place a succession plan to Bob Iger. And, of course, this is something that investors have been calling for for a while, along with some other things like cutting costs and clarifying a digital strategy. This is all in the lead up to a very important meeting next month, isn't it? Yeah, Disney annual meeting, a little later than normal this year, But two proxy fights, essentially two activist investors trying to get board seats- Very unusual, And this is a. this is a big one. I mean, Nelson Peltz obviously has a track record of doing these things. Whether he's successful this time we'll see next month. I mean, how much can we put, how much stock can we put in that track record, Chris. I mean, I went through this report here and it reads like a list of grievances. When I go back to other reports that I've seen from other activist investors, including Starboard and a few others, You have these lengthy reports, but a good chunk of those reports are about the solutions. What are the solutions other than putting him and Jay on the board, Right? Yeah, I also read 133 pages. not a whole lot of specifics in terms of what Nelson and Jeffries would do differently, Couple of minor things. He said that he thinks they should find a partner for their traditional TV networks- ABC- and that that's something that Bob Iger, Disney CEO, floated last year then backtracked on. There's also a recommendation in there that they do a better job of partnering, of, say, for example, selling ESPN plus along with Netflix, And that's that type of situation. But in terms of what specifically he'd do differently? no, not a lot in there. I guess this is something that everyone would wait for if he and Rossello were named to the board. Why Disney, Chris? Why is Nelson Peltz focused on this company in particular? You can look at Warner Brothers Discovery, for instance, which has done even worse since the stock debuted in April of 2022.. We know that Disney has certainly underperformed the S&P 500, but what is it about Disney that's vulnerable and therefore appealing to Peltz right now? Well, yeah, I mean, all of the big traditional media companies have gotten black. You know- Nelson does make a pretty strong case in there- that Disney has underperformed in recent years, both the financial results and the stock price performance. And Disney, though, has great assets And, unlike, say, Warner Brothers or Paramount, like you mentioned, it's not as dependent on the traditional TV business as those folks. They have a huge theme park business, For example. they've already built a very sizable 200 million or so streaming customers. So those assets make Disney a little more appealing than the- you know, the general media company right now.",[32]
204,n8UGDzNmtCc,Apple Cancels Electric Car Plans,Bloomberg Television,2024-02-28 12:29:29+00:00,"Mark Collective, Wow- Came out of the newsroom when we saw this story across here. I mean, this is a project that the company is working on for for a decade. at this point, What do we know about Apple's electric car plants? Yeah, So Apple this morning officially cancelled work on a self-driving electric car. Jeff Williams, the company's chief operating officer, and Kevin Lynch, the company's vice president of technology, who was foremost in charge of the car project, announced to the team- It's about 2000 people- that the project, called Titan internally, is winding down. There will be layoffs of some hardware people. Hardware people will have the opportunity to apply to other teams. Other people working on the project are being shifted to Apple's AI and Machine Learning Division to work on generative AI products, a key future component of the company. There will some. There will some. There will be some people move to the Vision Pro as well, with that focus on spatial computing. But this is a bombshell development. This is a very rare retreat for Apple. This is a project that they've invested over $10 billion in. They've worked on it for over ten years. It's had many fits and starts. It's had many directional changes. About a month ago, we reported that Apple had reached a make or break point for the car project. We reported that the latest incarnation of the project, after several meetings with the company's board of directors, was a new budget around a level two plus car. That was a downgrade from the original vision of a level four or a level five fully autonomous vehicle, And they also pushed back and delayed that. Since then there have been more discussions and executives made the final decision earlier this month, I'm told, to completely shutter the project. So again, this is Apple canceling work on an electric car. This is a significant development for one of the company's most ambitious attempts at a new product category in its history. So this is a very significant day for the company. Yeah, very significant. It's not like it's just, you know, an idea on the back of a napkin. I mean they have been pursuing, as you said, Mark, for over ten years. The road was rough, though, in in Apple's pursuit in terms of bringing a car to market. I mean, you know this company- for them to step up the amount of time, money, people, effort that they're put into something like this, I don't know How do you get your head around it. Does it mean just completely done? Does it mean that they could buy into something in the future Or they're just saying this isn't a market for us. Certainly, there are considerations on the table to acquire an existing car maker. Obviously, you've seen what's happened in the car industry lately. Rivian has not been doing so hot. You've seen other car companies struggling, lucid being one. Tesla has had its own ups and downs. It's a very, very thin profit margin business. It's not the typical business that Apple likes to get into. but there is some risk in abandoning this project. What if Alphabet's Google, Waymo, Amazon with Zoox, some of these other big technology companies, certainly the Chinese phone makers- they're all getting into cars. What if one of these companies comes up with a great car idea one day and successfully creates a new ecosystem of its own to rival Apple's? And they can risk pulling people away from Apple into a Google car or an Amazon car and getting them on their other products in the ecosystem. So there are certainly some very long term risks here, But in the short term this may be a good thing for Apple, being able to focus resources towards perhaps more promising areas in the short term, like spatial computing and generative artificial intelligence. Well, that's exactly where I wanted to go with you. next, Mark, to you. is this more about Apple saying no to a car and less about Apple focusing resources on AI? Or is it the other way around here? Is it all about Apple saying, wait a second? the rise in interest in generative AI over the last 18 months has just been massive and we need to go all in on this, such that we need to actually cancel our work on the car in order to do that. It's certainly not not the latter Tim. This is Apple making a decision to wind down the car project because they weren't getting anywhere. You kept getting delayed, it kept getting more expensive. They have these hundreds and thousands of employees that are brilliant people and we have places for them. Generative is a key area. Let's throw them there. There's a lot of artificial intelligence, machine learning, overlap between work on an autonomous vehicle and what needs to be done for the future of AI on phones and watches and earbuds and glasses and such, So it makes sense to reallocate those resources. But don't be mistaken: this is a decision all about cancelling the car. They just happened to have an excellent soft landing for the resources that have been invested in the vehicle project. Okay, so if you're an investor in Apple and you're saying to yourself: I'm a little concerned about the decline And iPhone sales in China. I'm a little concerned about the traditional Apple products being long in the tooth here. I don't necessarily see promise, at least right now, in spatial computing, Mark. what is there on the horizon for these investors to get excited about? Because I think on a lot of minds have been okay, well, at least Apple is working on a car here and that will be out at some point. Certainly, the Vision Pro is something that Apple is focused on. That is a big new category for them, And certainly generative eye AirPods with cameras is something I wrote about. the eventual debut of augmented reality glasses. There are certainly other things on the roadmap that could be exciting, but nothing that would drive as much immediate revenue as 100 grand car. Yeah, talk about it. Right, That really moves the needle. It's a moment, as we say, but another exclusive by you, Marc. that's really got everybody kind of rethinking some of the of what Apple's doing in the future. It's just a really, really big deal. I will say. Apple shares are still up about half a percent, But nonetheless really interesting when it comes to Apple's strategy. Mark, Thanks so much for for jumping in and telling us about your exclusive.",[1]

I know they've been looking inside Spirit for months. um, my guess is they've looked inside and they just feel like they can't control quality well enough as an outsider. they used to own Spirit- not not as it looks exactly now, but they used to own, you know those, those facilities. uh, it makes you majority of the 737 fuselage, it makes the front portion, the 787, two extremely important products. I think they've looked inside and they said: we can't control quality well enough from the outside. we got to buy this thing. do we trust Boeing to have the kind of quality control that Spirit needs? Boeing doesn't have a choice. Boeing's got to get quality control or they got a major problem on their hands and so, uh, I guess, I think, as an owner, I think it is the path, probably a good path forward. uh, I, I do think they will get the quality uh issues in hand, but it's going to take some time. uh, but they have to, they, they have no choice. yeah, I'm looking at the. uh, the stock of Boeing pretty much unchanged on the the news here, I think if I were an investor in Boeing, I would think I may or may. it may or may not make Financial sense to own this Spirit thing, but I would say it's probably the best way to move forward here. and when you talk to investors, George, how did they think that way? uh, you know, I think investors, you know, I don't know that they- you could say they all monolithically- think that way. um, I think, if they're, if they're could have been a way to keep it outside, not have to buy it. um, uh, you know, I think they, that probably would have pleased people more. I mean, there will be an unwinding required in this transaction, right? so Airbus is A320. some of the components are made Spirit. I'm I'm imagining that Airbus is not going to be, uh, interested in having, you know, Boeing as a subcontractor on their airplane. um, you know, and there their other defense products, you know, for locked and things like that. it's going to require some work to, I think, to unwind this thing a little bit. uh, in order to, to, you know, in order to pull it inside a Boeing. probably energy you would prefer not going to spend, but again, I think it's their most important. products are flowing through spirit and spirit's been a source of the problems in some of those products lately, and if Boeing is going to much higher production rates, which is where they're going to generate the cash flow they need, the profitability they need. they've got to stabilize production and I think you know they must have looked at it and said: we got to own it. and so, if you're an investor, I think you're H. okay, yeah, it's the way forward. I'd rather not have taken this path, but it's the way forward. um, this is a leading question and it could be very wrong, but does this tell us anything about how bad things are at Spirit? that this is the option? I think it does. how bad things Spirit? to me it sounds like it's so bad they got to buy it. um, and I think that's bad. right, if you're, if you're Bo, you do want to preserve cash. right, you, you don't want to go make an acquisition. you got plenty of other things to manage right now. but, uh, I think it means that, yes, the turnover at spirit's been bad. uh, the quality control. I think that's led to the quality control problems. you want to have your hand in how those line workers are being managed, how the quality control was being handled. um, yeah, I think it means it was really bad at Spirit. all right, the shares of spirit Eros systems, spr is the ticker for your Bloomberg terminal, up 14%. uh, year to-day trading has resumed here. so, uh, obviously the market signing pretty high probability that something will get done here. so, George, just looking at Boeing holistically, you know, as you've told us in the past, you know this is a scale business. you got to make as many planes as you can for that over that fixed cost base. you have talk to us about the production goals, talk just where they are in production today and where do they want to get to and do you think that's a reasonable Glide path? uh, so they are at 38 today, although they'll tell you, even though they're their suppliers are building at 38 and delivering the Boeing at 38. Boeing is not putting 38 out. so I I don't know, they're somewhere between. they're somewhere in the high 30s, let's say, depends what month it is. that that's on per month basis, just in general, sorry. and that's on the 737 y, that's their most important product. uh, on the 787, you know we're in in the, I think, fiveish, sixish area right now. uh, on on 737, uh, you know they've got goals to be into the 50s. they've um and at the end of the last expansion phase, before the pandemic, before the Max uh crashes and groundings. you know they they were. they were in the 60s, they're not going to go. the 60s airbuses, you know, for the 73- 7 Airbus is talking about going to 75 for the A320. so I think if you and I were inside the Boeing management meetings and they told you where they really wanted to go, they want to be up there near um, near Airbus. you know, taking a, a 5050 complement of this Market. is that the right place to go? yes, are they? they're talking mid decade. yes, probably pulling spirit inside. timing probably had a lot to do with that too. they thought, look, how can we stabilize this fastest? because we don't want to keep giving away share to Airbus.",[78]

208,f2QpF-7f37I,"HPE CEO Neri on Forecast, Supply Issues and Networking",Bloomberg Television,2024-03-01 15:59:11+00:00,"Thanks for joining us today here. on the back of the earnings- And it seems like the earnings picture for HP is to a certain extent similar to the earnings picture for a lot of your peers- Supply exceeding demand. However, the bottom line for HP does differ from some of your peers. Why? Well, good morning, Thanks for having me. You know, we had a what I call a mixed quarter. On the one hand, we had the very strong profitability, which is very different than our peers, I would say. But if you look at our profitability, we grew 200% at 200 basis points year over year, And that's the mix that we continue to drive as a part of our portfolio mix shift. But I continue to be the key of the story, right, the center of the story, And through the, for the five quarter since the cycle started, we booked $4 billion, but only we are being able so far to convert $1,000,000,000. And the reality remained that a big chunk of the revenue is going also through the, what I call the air, which means that you don't get the benefit in period revenue, but you get it over the longer period of time. Right, And then reality is also that we have the network in business a little bit softer than we wanted to in the back half of the quarter and that's having a short term impact, But long term, we have no concerns about our ability to compete in the network and hybrid cloud in the air space. I am curious, though, about the air. Basically, we're talking about deferred revenue, orders that are there effectively, that you still have to fill, orders that you've had trouble filling because you can't get either the GPUs or other components necessary to complete those orders. What is the lead time right now for your ability to acquire those GPUs? And, more importantly, does that backlog? are there any sort of contractual outs for those customers if you don't meet a certain timetable? Yeah, No, I will say that supply is starting to improve. We already have a low supply, but is being now held through either customer acceptances or customer readiness to accept these products, because they need the space, the power and the cooling And in some cases you know that they are taking a little bit longer than we expected and we're going to have a lower revenue convert in the back half because of those two issues are going to be much better manage. I will say lead times continue to be long. I mean in the 20 plus weeks. So this is the reality we are dealing with and we are setting the expectation upfront with customers that obviously is going to take that long time to get it, But the demand continues to be very strong. The pipeline is very strong. We see now demand in the enterprise space, in the influence inside- and this is one of the benefits remain with as a service model. because this- these systems are very expensive, need the local power. Most of the times they don't have neither the power or the cooling in the space And honestly, they don't want to outlay the massive amount of CapEx upfront. So that's why RHP Green Lake value proposition is going to help us going forward And that also will smooth the revenue linearity of the systems so that recovery in terms of lead time. does that wind up explaining why your back half of this year outlook looks a little bit better? You cut your full year guidance, but it does still look a little bit backloaded. Is that why Part of Alex, and also part because we also have a lot of systems now being installed- that takes, you know, another couple of quarters to get the acceptances. Remember that the systems will recognize revenue at the time with acceptance, not as a type of shipment, And so you have a combination of better supply and a significant number of acceptances that will will materialize to the back half. Well, what I don't understand- maybe you can help me clarify- is that Dell seems to be doing pretty well. So I'm just wondering what the difference is between you and Dell. Is it the CPU's like where? is it trickier? for you, I don't think there is that much difference, to be honest with you, But the investors think so because the stocks are reacting differently. Yeah Well, I think the networking softness is is actually affecting us. that doesn't have a networking based on it at all. And remember that we deliver amazing growth in the last two years and now you're going a little bit of a slowdown. But when it comes to the I, we booked $4 billion of cumulative orders and and we have grown equal or maybe even, in some cases, better than that. But our backlog sits at $3 billion As a. as I looked at yesterday, Dell has 2.9 billion, And the difference for us is going to be a favor for us as we go forward, because we have deep expertise in data center services. Dell doesn't own half of that. We have two data centers that now are up and operational to provide GPO as a service to customers. That would be a benefit. Third is, we have a network business to scale systems that they don't have either, particularly with HP Slingshot, and for that is HP Greenlake, and Greenlake will give customers the ability to access this technology without paying CapEx. Today, Alex, the vast majority of the action we have seen has been in mobile builders, and those are, you know, our customers do just that. a lot of capital, And then, you know, just in Egypt was a better medal. Fair enough, Antonio. I do want to talk a little bit more about the networking side of the business. A lot of analysts raised concerns on the call about the acquisition of Juniper Networks- a pending acquisition, I should say- and whether that pending acquisition did maybe cause a little bit of a chill for customers adopting new orders in the quarter. Well, I can tell you, Romain, undeniably that there was no slowdown because of the acquisition. We have not lost one single deal. And what I will tell you? the customers now are very excited, And I just came from the Mobile World Congress. As you know, that's a massive event for the communications business And every single customer and partner we talked to they were excited about this combination because through these inflection point. you're going to need more network ports, not less ports, and the ability to really bring together the native world. the cloud Native world is what customers are going to struggle And, as you think about the combination, HP will double the size of the networking business. At the core, HP will be a networking company that will provide hybrid cloud anyhow- services. From a shareholder perspective, this is amazingly accretive day one, and we have a path to create more synergies as we go forward, So I'm actually super excited about this and I can't wait to get this close. There's also, with regard to those synergies, Antonio, as you know, there's still also a lot of overlap between Juniper's business and your own networking business that you have on the books right now. How do you make sure that once that deal is complete, the cost structure is going to be favorable? I actually contest that. that statement. That is not an overlap. Let me give you a simple answer about that. We have three segments of the market: the cloud market, the service provider market, the enterprise market, insight, the networking business, the service provider and cloud market. We have zero overlap. We are not in that space. on the enterprise market. We have zero overlap in the datacenter space, because we have been a campus and branch company and in the data center we're going to drive the convergence of our air interconnect fabric, which we call a split Slingshot is a Ethernet based fabric that supports all accelerators, included NVIDIA and the and Intel. And then we're going to drive that convergence with Juniper Data Center business with an AI driven experience that will benefit us to reduce CapEx and OpEx for customers and then converge that- you know, a native, a cloud native world. on the campus and branch. you will see that we're going to integrate the mist driven technology with Aruba Central. By the way, Aruba Central has now 30,000 customers on the platform And ultimately, underneath that is the Aruba Infrastructure Services where we have the IP in silicon software and services. So the overlap is extremely minimal. but obviously customers want to see what the roadmap is going forward.",[315]

Yeah well, invariably it's going to be a bit of both, like so many companies on the planet. I mean, where I usually sit, in Berlin, we talk about this with all the executives that sell massively into China, whether it's carmakers or chips or all that sort of thing. It's everyone's been talking about a rebound in the back half of the year for two years. It just has not come. And you see that weakness now. You see it in China and you see it in the sales. I mean down 24%, Francine. iPhone sales in just the first six week of the year is absolutely mammoth. This is the biggest smart smartphone market in the world. So, yes, there is this, that question, And, of course, Apple is selling a premium product when you have a lot of competitors that have a much better price point. I mean Apple has been eroding, eroding market share. They're down now to about 60% of the market share in China. They were at 19% last year and they're losing more ground steadily. But overall, you know the overall market for smartphones was down also 7%. So there is definite weakness that is coming across across the market. So why did rivals in China, what did they do differently that actually did better than Apple. Well, one of the main issues is going to be exactly that question of the premium. There are cheaper phones, but they're also very good phones And there's also a huge amount of effort and energy in China to really get that tech independence and to sort of raise up its own producers of phones. So, for example, you know there's this question of patriotic buying right. Huawei came out with this new phone that the state media was really touting, saying that this is really a great response to us sort of tech and chip supremacy. and Huawei: in those six weeks, while everybody was down, their sales were up 64%, which is absolutely mammoth, And we should also say that this is sort of eclipsed the story. But for Apple, they have a problem in China. They've got a problem here in Brussels too with this huge fine that's coming down the pipeline. So these are all things to watch, as Apple will face problems in China and more regulatory scrutiny here in Brussels.",[1]

213,cwUrmJm9O2E,"Budget Carrier IndiGo Has Solid and Healthy Financial Basis, CEO Says",Bloomberg Television,2024-02-28 04:24:36+00:00,"[CC may contain inaccuracies]. We're seeing IndiGo among the Asian carriers the worst affected by the Whitney groundings. At last count, there was something upwards of 70 jets that were grounded. Where are you on this now? Is it getting better, Getting worse? Good morning, and thanks for having me in the studio. You know we we indeed have the challenges of the supply chain and the problem with these challenges which basically started already a little over a year ago. so that that's where where Indigo has developed actually a strategy to deal with it. So if we look to what it has effectively done in our capacity, we have been able, by a whole range of mitigating measures, to live up to our capacity guidance. So if you look to the calendar year 23,, we've been able to welcome 100 million customers on both of our flights, which we're only 78 million the year prior. So we moved up from 78 million in 22 to 100 million in 23.. So that whole range of mitigating measures in terms of actual leases, lease extensions, bringing in other aircraft, has really helped us. I think most important part for Indigo is we do have a order book of a thousand planes. with that order book of a thousand planes, We got basically a plane coming in each and every week. That, for us, makes sure that, despite all the challenges in the supply chain, we have the opportunity to deliver our capacity guidance and expand our network. Where are you on compensation talks with Pratt Whitney? You know, of course, we are in constant dialogue with them, Whitney, And we started that dialogue already over a year ago when the first supply chain challenges submersed recently that have got more severe, as we know, by some of the additional inspections to be done And, of course, we're in constant dialogue on that with. we've tried them with the, and I would rather have that discussion behind closed doors. Okay, What about what you can tell us in terms of how much that is affecting revenue? You know, again, for us it was important to live up to our capacity guidance and that we have been able. Having said that, of course, if you, if home is the fastest growing aviation market in the world, if home is a market which is hungry for capacity, where the market is expected to double from today to 2030, today there's 150 million domestic fliers. That number is going up to 300 million by 2030.. We can use every plane duration, every grounded plane because of supply chain challenges- one too many. So we're discussing that with Fred and Whitney. We take a whole range of measures And I hope that in due course of the of the year we get a better visibility on what's next. Okay, How soon do you think this can be fully resolved for your carrier? I mean, I spoke to the Cebu Pacific CEO last week. He says he sees the issue stretching till 2026.. You know, that's that's, I guess, the guidance which was given by Pratt and Whitney on what is going to be the duration of their show. I have no no reason to take a different guidance than the guidance which was given by Pratt and Whitney. Again, where Indigo probably is different than some of the other carriers is our order book plane coming in every every week, which means we are one year down the road from now. We have received another 50 aircraft, So we have a good, a good visibility and a good opportunity actually to deal with these challenges. I wish they were not there. The reality is they are there and we find an effective way of dealing with it. But even Airbus is facing supply issues. Do you think that target or deliveries that's going to be met? How realistic is that? I mean the same, the same story. We have a constant, constant dialogue with Airbus We have again. our number is very, very significant. We had our planes delivered in 23, according to the, the, the, the agreements we have made with with Airbus, And we continue to work closely to make sure that for 24 and the years ahead we'll have that exact same dynamic going forward as you take on these planes and expand capacity. What are the international routes that you're really focusing on for expansion? Yeah, you know, indigo in itself is a, I would say, a wonderful industry example and unprecedented really. So when we reached hundred million customers last year and in the year 23,. it was the first airline reaching hundred million customers in a single year, in such a short time span. So that speaks to the market and the quality of the company itself really going forward. That network we had was very much domestic, domestic, happy, if you wish. So today we operate 86 domestic destinations and 32 and some 33 international. around a quarter of our seat kilometers is international and all the rest is domestic. We operate five on the grounds: 400 domestic, a little short of 100 international Going forward. that internationalization is part of our very much part of our strategy and really matching also the plays in the taking from an economic and GDP perspective on the world stage, More and more trade, more and more FDI. So we continue to build on that. Which regions exactly are you going to prioritize? You know, traditionally Indigo is very much focused on, I would See, the Middle East type of region between India and the Middle East. We have added there, more recently, Southeast Asia. Today we flight from a different Indian cities into Singapore, for example. So we expand massively into Southeast Asia. We have recently strengthened further that scope. So we've added, for the first time in history, Indigo is flying to the African continent. So we have launched in August of last year, Mumbai to Nairobi and after that we moved up to Central Asia, back with the ability: Almaty, Tashkent, all operated out of Delhi, And we have announced actually this week, from Delhi, fly to Bali. So you see that that sort of scope is growing. when we get the embassy SLR, which is also part of our order book, we are able to further expand that scope. So I would say you can see almost a parallel between the growth of India and what the country is doing and India by Indigo really moving that scope and moving that international exposure expansion on your end and helping to make the world smaller for travelers. in a way, You're the chief of the largest carrier in the country that is now the most populous nation in the world. What is that going to mean for that demographic dividend And how do you see the air costs of the airline helping to democratize air travel in Asia? Yeah well, thank you for bringing up that point And I think Indigo has done a wonderful job there by giving air travel access to millions and millions of Indians. And if you think about it, you know going from from Mumbai to Bihar used to be like 24 hours by train. Now people go 2 hours by plane. So what it does in economic growth, what it does in accessibility, and still the numbers from an international skill are still relatively limited. as a single digit number of Indian population having a passport, Can you imagine what that number doubles. and going international, There's still a limited number of people taking air travel as compared to, for example, rail or roads. And the Indian government is very much embracing, I would say, mobility- train, road, plane- as part of the economic growth And, of course, new airports being built are really helping us to propel that forward. So today we have that: hundred million customers. We expect to double in size towards the end of the decade. So that is where, where the company is going. What is that going to mean for capital expenditure? Well, you need to raise funds. Are you going to consider tapping the international? But we we have a very healthy performance financially prior to COVID. of course, go with, for Indigo, like any other airline in the world, put a big dent in that. We have now completed five quarters of consecutive profit. So we're really out of the out of the go with five quarters of consecutive profit And the last quarter net profit. this helped us to become net worth positive again. So I would say we have a very solid and healthy financial basis. We have an order book which we have different forms of financing for. We're exploring different forms of financing for and we continue to build on that strength And, again, out of Covid, five quarter of solid profits is really helping us to solidify that. that position and that hand-in-hand with growth is really moving us forward.",[175]

IT BRINGS ME TO WHAT WE HEARD FROM THE CHIEF ECONOMIST AT APOLLO, WHO MADE NEWS TODAY WITH HIS VIEW THAT A RE-ACCELERATING ECONOMY AND A RISE IN UNDERLYING INFLATION MEANS THE FEDERAL RESERVE WILL NOT CUT RATES AT ALL THIS YEAR. WHAT SAY YOU, MARK? I MISSED THAT I DIDN'T HEAR. HE MADE THAT CHANGE. YOU KNOW IT'S A SCENARIO. IT'S POSSIBLE BUT I THINK MORE LIKELY. INFLATION WILL CONTINUE TO COME IN AND GET BACK TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE'S TARGET BY LATE THIS YEAR. THE ECONOMY WILL CONTINUE TO MODERATE SUFFICIENTLY THAT THE FED WILL CUT INTEREST RATES. I EXPECT- IF NOT AT THE MAY MEETING, IT FEELS LIKE THE JUNE MEETING- A QUARTER-POINT CUT. EACH QUARTER, A COUPLE RATE CUTS THIS YEAR IS MORE LIKELY THAN RAISING INTEREST RATES THIS YEAR. JOE, YOU HAVE BEEN POINTING TO SEASONAL FACTORS IN THE PCE DATA THIS WEEK. I WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHT ON THE FIRST DROP IN CONSUMER SENTIMENT IN -- I WONDER YOU THOUGHT ON THE FIRST DROP IN CONSUMER SENTIMENT IN FOUR MONTHS. WE READ IT MORE CLOSELY THAN POLITICAL POLLS AROUND HERE, MARK. YOU KNOW WHAT, JOE, NOT MUCH. I THINK THAT IS THE MICHIGAN STORE YOU ARE REFERRING TO. I DON'T PAY MUCH ATTENTION TO A PARTICULAR SURVEY. PEOPLE ANSWER THE QUESTIONS THROUGH THE PRISM OF THEIR OWN POLITICAL PERSPECTIVE. IF YOU LOOK AT THE RESPONSES TO THAT SURVEY BY REPUBLICANS AND COMPARE THAT TO DEMOCRATS NIGHT AND DAY, AND THAT'S WHICH IS DEPENDING ON WHO IS IN THE OVAL OFFICE PIT. I HAVEN'T PAID MUCH ATTENTION TO THAT SURVEY, THE CONFERENCE BOARD SURVEY. I LIKE THAT SURVEY. THEY HAVE BEEN DOING THAT SINCE THE 1970'S AND THAT IS MORE CONSISTENT WITH THE CONSUMERS DOING THEIR THING. AS MARY DALY WAS TALKING ABOUT, IT IS AN INDEX AND THE AVERAGE OVER TIME IS ABOUT 100.. THE LAST MONTH WAS 106.. NOT GREAT PEOPLE AREN'T FEELING FANTASTIC, BUT THEY ARE FEELING GOOD ENOUGH TO KEEP ON SPENDING. I THINK BY THAT MEASURE- THE BETTER MEASURE- WE ARE FINE. THE ECONOMY IS DOING JUST FINE. KAILEY DOING JUST FINE HERE IN WASHINGTON. I GUESS YOU COULD SAY WE ARE DOING JUST FINE BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT ISN'T GOING TO SHUT DOWN, AT LEAST PARTIALLY THIS WEEKEND, AS WE MAY BE A FEW DAYS AGO. I KNOW THE ECONOMIC RAMIFICATIONS OF A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN AREN'T AS SEVERE AS DEFAULTING ON OUR DEBT. HAD WE NOT RAISE THE DEBT CEILING LAST YEAR BUT FITCH RELEASED THEIR LATEST RATING OF THE UNITED STATES, CONFIRMING AA+, AFFIRMING THEM RATHER, AND THERE IS A NOTE ABOUT HOW DIVIDED GOVERNMENT COMPLICATED THE BUDGET PROCESS, TALKING ABOUT HOW IT HAS LED TO REPEATED EPISODES OF BRINKMANSHIP EVEN, IF NOT IN THE IMMEDIATE TERM IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC RAMIFICATIONS, HOW SHOULD WE BE THINKING ABOUT THE DYSFUNCTION IN WASHINGTON AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR OUR LONGER-TERM ECONOMIC OUTLOOK. FOR FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY MARK, IT IS CLEARLY AN ISSUE PROBLEM. OUR FISCAL OUTLOOK IS PRETTY DARK IF WE DON'T MAKE CHANGES TO FISCAL POLICY AND TAX-AND-SPEND POLICY. LOOK AT THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE'S RECENT FORECAST. THE CBO IS THE NONPARTISAN GROUP THAT DOES BUDGETING FOR THE COUNTRY UNDER CURRENT POLICY. THE DEBT TO GDP RATIO WOULD GO FROM 100% TODAY -- BY THE WAY, MORE THAN DOUBLE IT WAS BEFORE THE FINANCIAL CRISIS. 100% TODAY AND I MAKING THE NUMBER 115% CAN NEWS FROM NOW. 180%, 30 YEARS FROM NOW -- YOU CAN DO YOUR OWN FORECAST. THAT IS NOT SUSTAINABLE. LAWMAKERS DO NEED TO GET IT TOGETHER AND COME TOGETHER, FOR WHEN THEY ARE SHUTTING THE GOVERNMENT DOWN AND THREATENING TO DO THAT, WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THE DEBT LIMIT AGAIN ON EITHER SIDE OF THE ELECTION, THIS TIME, NEXT YEAR. IF THEY ENGAGE IN PIGMENT SHIP -- IN BRINKMANSHIP- OR BREACH THE DEBT LIMIT, WE'VE GOT A BIG PROBLEM. THAT IS NOT THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WE HAVE OR ISSUE, BUT THAT IS DEFINITELY A PROBLEM THAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO FACE IN THE NOT-TOO-DISTANT FUTURE, BECAUSE IT IS A CORROSIVE ON THE ECONOMY, JOE, SPEAKING TO THE STRENGTH OF THE CONSUMER. TODAY, MARK ZANDI, WE CAUGHT UP WITH JARED BERNSTEIN, WHO CHAIRS THE COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS AT THE WHITE HOUSE, WHO IS REFLECTING ON NOT ONLY CONSUMER SENTIMENT BUT OTHER INDICATORS HE IS PUTTING TOGETHER AS A COMPOSITE. HERE IS WHAT HE SAID: >>. I DON'T THINK ANYONE SHOULD CHANGE THEIR VIEW THAT CONSUMER SENTIMENT, CO CONSUMER CONFIDENCE, HAS BEEN MOVING IN A PRETTY RELIABLE WAY IN A DIRECTION SUGGESTING ECONOMIC IMPROVEMENTS HAVE BEEN REACHING PEOPLE IN A WAY. THEY WEREN'T A FEW MONTHS AGO AND THOSE IMPROVEMENTS REFLECT EASING INFLATIONARY PRESSURES, A STRONG JOB MARKET RISING REAL WAGE GROWTH, VERIZON, CONSUMER SPENDING AND GDP -- VERY STRONG CONSUMER SPENDING AND GDP, JOE. YOU HAD A SIMILAR REACTION TO THE CONSUMER SENTIMENT DATA OUT TODAY, MARK. YOU MENTIONED THE CONFIDENCE NUMBERS. WHAT ELSE ARE YOU LOOKING AT IN THE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS? TO GAUGE THE STRENGTH OF THE CONSUMER AND GET A SENSE OF THE DOCTRINE OF INTEREST RATES, MARK. THE KEY HERE, JOE, IS THAT WAGE GROWTH HAS TO CONTINUE TO BE STRONGER THAN THE RATE OF INFLATION. PEOPLE'S SO-CALLED REAL WAGES HAVE TO CONTINUE TO RISE. THAT IS FORTUNATELY BEEN THE CASE FOR THE BETTER PART OF THE LAST YEAR, AND THAT IS ONE OF THE KEY REASONS WHY SENTIMENT IS STEADILY IMPROVING. PEOPLE ARE FEELING BETTER ABOUT THINGS. THEY ARE NOT FEELING GREAT. THEY REMEMBERED TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO WHEN INFLATION WAS RAGING STRONGER THAN WAGE GROWTH, REAL WAGES WERE DECLINING AND I WAS ON -- THAT WAS UNDERMINING PURCHASING POWER. WE ARE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND ALL THE TRENDLINES LOOK PRETTY GOOD. JOB MARKET IS STRONG: 3% UNEMPLOYMENT, ROCKSOLID. THAT SHOULD SUPPORT CONTINUED SOLID WAGE GROWTH. I BELIEVE THAT INFLATION WILL CONTINUE TO MODERATE IT'S HEADED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND THAT WILL CONTINUE. AND THAT MEANS REAL WAGES WILL REMAIN POSITIVE AND CONTINUE TO INCREASE. THAT IS THE KEY REASON FOR OPTIMISM ABOUT THE AMERICAN CONSUMER. THERE IS OTHER REASONS, BUT THAT IS THE KEY REASON. IF YOU ARE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE AMERICAN CONSUMER, MORE LIKELY THAN NOT YOU WILL BE LIKE. I AM A MORE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE US ECONOMY BECAUSE THE CONSUMER DRIVES THE TRAIN AND EVEN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY. THE US IS ONE OF THE STRONGEST ECONOMIES ON THE PLANET AND WE ARE DRIVING GROWTH THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE WORLD. THE REST OF THE WORLD IS STRUGGLING BUT IT WOULD LIKELY BE A RECESSION IF NOT FOR THE SUPPORT PROVIDED BY THE AMERICAN CONSUMER BUYING LOTS OF ROUTE THE REST OF THE WORLD IS PRODUCING -- LOTS OF WHAT THE REST OF THE WORLD IS PRODUCING. THAT IS THE KEY: MAKING SURE THAT REAL WAGES REMAIN POSITIVE. KAILEY, THE RESILIENCE OF THE CONSUMER THUS FAR HAS SURPRISED MANY. IT IS A QUESTION OF THE LONGEVITY OF THE PHENOMENON. WHERE DO YOU EXPECT WE WILL BE NOVEMBER 2024 WHEN VOTERS ARE HEADING TO THE POLLS IF POLICY STAYS TIGHTER THAN WE THOUGHT A FEW MONTHS AGO. BY THAT POINT, HOW MUCH WILL WE HAVE DETERIORATED MARK. YOU KNOW KAILEY. I THINK WE WILL BE FINE, REASONABLY GOOD YEAR- NOT AS GOOD AS 2023, BUT I THINK, A GOOD YEAR. I EXPECT A FED TO START CUTTING INTEREST RATES BUT EVEN IF THEY DON'T, I WAS ONLY COUNTING ON ONE INTEREST-RATE DECLINED BEFORE THE ELECTION IN NOVEMBER. I DON'T KNOW THAT. THAT IS A BIG DEAL. BUT EVERYTHING ELSE FEELS PRETTY GOOD: 3.7% UNEMPLOYMENT RATE. REAL WAGE GROWTH IS POSITIVE. PEOPLE ARE A LOT WEALTHIER: STOCK PRICES AT RECORD HIGHS. HOUSING VALUES AT RECORD HIGHS. IF YOU OWN YOUR OWN HOME- TWO THIRDS OF AMERICANS DO. YOU ARE SITTING PRETTY ON ALL THAT EQUITY. IF YOU ARE A SHAREHOLDER- 60% OF AMERICANS- YOU ARE DOING A LOT BETTER. I THINK WE SHOULD BE FEELING TO GOOD. I WILL THROW OUT ONE WILDCARD. THE THING THAT MAKES ME NERVOUS -- OIL PRICES AND THE CAST OF A GALLON OF REGULAR UNLEADED AND MORTGAGE RATES. THE TWO THINGS I WORRY ABOUT, THE MOST IN TERMS OF WHAT IT MIGHT MEAN FOR THE ELECTION FOR SOME JOE MARK GOOD TO SEE YOU, MARK ZANDI AND MOODY'S ANALYTICS.",[124]
215,5eCFoYJJNao,Boeing safety issues lead to lower durable goods orders in US,Bloomberg Television,2024-02-27 14:38:14+00:00,"Good morning John. Well, it is worse than anticipated, down 6.1% on the headline And of course, we did anticipate a 5% drop because Boeing didn't sell any planes, just three planes in the month of January. But even ex transportation it is down 3/10. So it is not a particularly good news. I'll look up the actual numbers in just a second here. But capital goods orders- non-defense X air- this is the part that economists like, because what goes into GDP- And that was up a 10th of a percent, which is what was forecast, So it's not all bad news. Shipments: up much more than anticipated, 8/10 of a percent- And that's good news because it suggests a stronger first quarter GDP number and it in combination the capital goods orders and shipments- suggest that businesses have not yet pulled back too much on what they're ordering and spending. Business spending, if it hangs in there is what we want to see. Mike, looking ahead, now we've got some house price data. after this, In about 29 minutes time, an hour after that, we'll get consumer confidence numbers. We've been talking about it in the last hour. If you look at equity markets- all time highs. you look at labor data- unemployment south of 4% for two years. Are we slowly starting to see consumer confidence pick up. We are, And we should see it with the Conference Board numbers because we saw it with the University of Michigan numbers. Each one is designed a little separately, and Conference Board is more about jobs, And boy did we see some good news on jobs the last time. Also, number to watch for in the Conference Board is people's anticipation of what their income is going to be over the coming six months to a year. If people think they're going to make the same or more money, then that suggests that they'll continue spending at the rate that they're doing. So that's something to keep in mind. This one doesn't have the political implications that the Michigan one does. They don't break it down by political party in the top line numbers And it's not as connected to gasoline prices as, of say, the University of Michigan survey, which tends to track more closely. I do want to get your view on housing prices. There's been a number of discussions about how housing prices seem to have troughed and actually are re accelerating, even despite the fact that you are seeing mortgage rates where they are. How closely is this something that Fed officials are watching and bringing up at a time where a lot of people are locked out of homeownership. Well, they're watching it. They're not as concerned about long term locked out of homeownership because they feel when interest rates start to come down, mortgage rates will go down, There'll be a pent up demand to sell housing and we'll see a lot more inventory come on the market. The problem right now is no inventory in existing homes because nobody wants to sell their 3% mortgage And so people are just sitting there. But a lot of people want to move. They're retiring, They want to go to Florida or they're you know. they're young people who have kids to want to move out. So strategic now that she's not even saying gas. she's just asking questions leading to say: my, the key here. Let me give you one number here, Just because everybody was wondering about Boeing and aircraft orders: new orders for non-defense aircraft, which is Boeing- down 58.9% during Wow. So that's why your headline number folks So awful.",[78]
216,u92knqOyDHE,O'Hara On The ETF Evolution,Bloomberg Television,2024-02-26 18:43:02+00:00,"is real diverse, uh, spreading around, if you will, of the assets. obviously there's people, you know, chasing Tech. I don't think you necessarily need to chase Tech. you could buy a broad Market ETF like the S&P 500 and still get pretty good Tech exposure, but not have all your eggs in that basket. our flows continue to be leaning towards value. small cap has been a real big surprise for us here lately. we do have the tech side of things. we've got a data and infrastructure product, so I think we're sort of where we were last year, um, which is a little puzzling to me, because last year at least we were coming off of really an obliteration in the tech names. but we're still stuck in the same place we're. we're looking at interest rates and what the fed's going to do. we're trying to figure out whether they've actually done their job and destroyed the US economy. I'm sorry, not destroyed the US economy, but, uh, cooled things down inflation wise. and then you know earnings are always going to be the issue going forward. um, you know I'm not as impressed with people beating their earnings as I am in what they're forecasting is going to happen and when you have these reports like you got out of outto last week where they sort of tamper things down. I think we're at a level right now where the Market's priced overall, a little bit on the high end, and so you know we have to be very, very careful about bad news. I mean, you made the joke about destroying the economy, but, man, that data continues to hold up really, really well. is there a reactive uh sense to ETF flows, like big reversals that are happening, and I guess I'm just trying to understand where the biggest misprice is if inflation kind of eventually keeps coming down and the data still stays okay? you know that could be what happens, Alex. you could actually. you know they might not actually destroy the US economy. they might do it perfectly right. they may have gotten inflation under control without, you know, having unemployment Spike and without having a major impact on, you know, everybody's earnings. I think the interesting thing that's happening right now is that- and I think you need to keep an eye on that- is: look at layoffs. I mean we're starting to see somewhat of an acceleration. so I think companies are starting to think to themselves going forward, how do I increase my earnings? well, one way to do that would be on the cost Side Of The Ledger, and so, as we came out of Co- you know that was the big spur that got the big Tech names going- is they were over you know, weight, if you will, employees- and they started to cut back and that's sort of what juic their returns- and I think you're starting to see that- go sort of a little bit more broadly across the board. hey, Sean, you say, um, maybe one of the ways to play AI is through the picks and shovels strategy. talk to us about how you'd get exposure that way. well, we have two strategies there. we own the data centers in the Sou phone towers, and so you can't have ai streaming, Internet of Things, e-commerce and online gaming. you can't have that without the buildings that essentially allow for all of the transmission of the data. so that's one way to play. it would be to buy data centers and cell phone towers. we have an ETF that does that, that tickers srvr server, and then the other way to do it is to play, if you will, the software names and and the and the chipmakers, um, and those names are, you know, basically the Nvidia is in that mix, but it's not all about Nvidia. there are a lot of companies in that space. and so we have an ETF that, uh, TR RFK traffic, that basically takes everything out of the data centers and says that's what we are. um, when you talk about Alternatives- we were talking to Kathy an whistle- uh, in the last hour about Alternatives and stuff- um, I'll throw Bitcoin in there. let's throw some REITs in there too. uh, what other kind of alternative ETF flows are you seeing? well, we have a, an income story that we like, that's starting to pick up some steam. essentially, its Target is to get four times the div into the S&P 500. four, four times, yes, the ticker qdp, get it quadruple. and the way- do that, the way we do. that is about 86% of the money is basically in the S&P, by 114% of it's in t bills, and those t- bills are used to enter into Futures contracts on the dividends, and so we're able to pull forward three times, or a little bit more than 3.14 times, this year's dividend by using those Futures. and so it's really done exactly what we've expected it to do, and with all the emphasis, for example, on covered calls. you know, with the success of some of the big players in that space, we think the limitation on covered calls is that you're selling away your upside, and with a strategy like this, you don't sell your upside away, so we're starting to see some interesting flows in that area as well. Sean, how do you compete in this market that's so dominated by just literally a couple of three or four kind of ETF per providers here? how do you kind of compete and set yourself apart? uh, we like to say innovative, disruptive and unique. that's what we build. so our neighborhood at home in Malin Pennsylvania is vanguards. we know who they are, we know what they do and we know that we're not ready to stand toe-to-toe with them. if you will and fight it out on cost, we'll let State Street do that. so we build strategies. we buil an end user in mind or an outcome in mind. maybe that's EXs return or maybe that's risk management, or maybe it's something like the count series. that just takes a completely look different. look at the way you define value in this world. instead of using traditional Price to Book, we use free cash flow yield, because the stock market is primarily int intangible assets today, and so that's what we do, and, and so we've been able to accumulate, I think, a reasonable amount of assets- around 40 billion right now. I, I think there's a lot of room for us to grow and, um, you know, if you're Innovative and you're disruptive and unique- unique- and you have a Salesforce, like we do, that focuses on the financial advisors, you can continue to build a nice business. I don't have to have A5 trillion dollar business, yeah, I, just to keep growing it like we have been and and we'll continue to do that. we all, I really want to have the job where you get to come up with the names for these things, like the tickers for it. I want to do that. that sounds like a good time before we let you go. um, it's not just us that have been doing really well, right? Japanese equities- Nik record high. the CAC- the Dax record highs. what opportunities are you seeing internationally? well, we missed Japan. we probably should have had a product there because, uh, whenever Warren Buffett starts to move in an area, it's probably good to pay attention, and so he's increasing his exposure there, so he's probably right. we've seen a pretty big increase in our Global and intern ational. uh, my favorite story- and it may take patience, I'll just warn all the viewers and listeners- is Emerging Markets. I mean, you know, we have an Emerging Market product that has like a 9% current dividend, um, and it's 100 profitable Emerging Market names and I think that cycle has gone on too long. it could continue for a while, but sooner or later the Emerging Market cycle will change and if you think about historically how they do relative to us, over time they do better. it's just been a currency problem here lately, and so for long-term investors, maybe you tuck a little bit of money in Emerging Markets.",[191]
217,5Sdk1t5Kf6A,"There's Been a Regime Change in FX, Says TD's McCormick",Bloomberg Television,2024-02-28 17:37:18+00:00,"MK mccomic of TD remains bearish on the US dollar. here's the quote from him: the clear shift is in the direction of a better Global growth engine. we pushed back on the dollar rally in October, underscoring that the US exceptionalism theme was waning. Global growth- not just the US- is improving, creating Tailwinds for Global equities, a weaker dollar and outperformance of cyclical assets. Mark McCormack is with us now for more. Mark, let's get into it. regime change- that's what you think. walk us through what's changed. so in the context of the FX Market, there's been a dramatic regime change. we went from two years of focusing on a couple factors that relate to all the things that are happening around the world. we had carry outperform, which we had countries in Emerging Market of higher yields, those currencies outperformed, which was quite interesting in itself because this came through a Fed tightening cycle. the other side of it was the terms of trade, which is commodity momentum. so what we've been dealing with for two years in FX was G10 inflation, which was a dollar trade, uh, carry, which was a dollar trade in G10, and then terms of trade, which generally more Global. so I think what we've seen in the last 6 months, since the bare steepening of the US curve and the breaking of risk appetite through the summer. what we've seen is markets are now shifting a little bit more towards risk, but what I think what we're seeing is the regime is changing. we don't know what's on the other side. uh, there's so many conversations we have with clients is: is the world going into recession, are we going to have high inflation or are we going to see disinflation? so what we're seeing now, and what I think is really interesting, is that G10 itself in the world is pivoting more towards growth. we're carrying I. what we see in our models is less focus on inflation. so if inflation is going up, you don't want to buy the currency anymore. what we're seeing is that growth is being upgraded, largely because what the market cares about has changed in the last 6 months. well, let's get to the menu. in G10, we'll go through some numbers. so: Sterling 126, the Euro 108, doll Yen 150ish. yes, where do you want to play this story? fre one, yeah. so I think you want to play through a mix of G10 and emerging markets. and that's what's interesting about effects, because what we're seeing is now in the way that we analyze the markets. we're seeing G10 and Emerging Markets participating at the same time to basically collaborate against the dollar. so if you think about what's high quality in Emerging Markets, you've got India, you've got Mexico, you've got Brazil, you've got Colombia, so you've got the carry story, um, and you've got some high quality growth story. but I think India is the the key thing you want to be looking at. another thing that we really like is Korea. Korea is correlated to the global gr story, which this is where I think everyone's been wrong. everyone's been focused only on us exceptionalism. but if you look at leading indicators, nowcast data, surprises, data Trends, all these things in Europe and in Asia, everything is participating at the same time. so last year we went through a wave of us looks great, China and Europe are underperforming. at one point, China and Europe look great, the US is underperforming. what we're seeing for the first time is all three regions are firing in the same direction and that is positive for Global growth Dynamics. it's pos positive for equities, so that's good for Sterling. it's good for Euro. I don't think euro is the the best way to trade this, and the yen is also more of a boj feature. so the way that we like playing the G10 is: you're selling the Swiss versus the Y because the sb's done boj is ready to go. I think there's Market spending way too much time listening to what the boj says, because they are never going to speed food you, they are always going to surprise. and we have the wage negotiations coming up and then, following that, we have a boj meeting, which, to me, is very, very live.",[343]

Chesapeake Energy and eqt Corp, two of the largest producers of natural gas, have announced production cuts for 2024 in an attempt to bring some equili I back into the market. the cumulative effort appears to have stemed some of the recent selling pressure, as natural gas has rebounded to just under $2 in early March. the question remains, even with the production Cuts: will demand stabilize to the point to offset excess?

I would say no. however, as has been pointed out out, policy makers need to feel confident that the declining inflation Trend will continue to move lower for an extended period. recent data has indicated that six-month Trends are at, or below the 2% Target, but fed officials, along with other Central Bankers, don't believe this is a big enough sample to begin to cut rates, particularly with the January US inflation data demonstrating a backup, as both CPI and PPI came in hotter than expected. another Factor shifting expectations is a strong labor market and economic data in a solid growth pattern. should the consumer begin to lose confidence and the labor market begin to weaken, I don't believe the fed and other central banks will wait too long to begin to cut rates, even if the eurover year inflation remains above 2%.","[107, 115]"

I mean, I would take it first from small cap, which has been, you know, a relative underperformer, battered and bruised. but I think you do have to lighten up if, if you've enjoyed 24% return over the last four months, which is what you've gotten- November, December, January, February- four months, right, that is impressive. you'd be wise to take a little profit there to the conversation you were having earlier. remember and recall um Sage words. wisdom says bull markets die in Euphoria, right, um to the point. there is no downside that anybody sees at this point. there is. we are starting to approach a little bit of euphoria here and I think you have to set that context correctly. let's get into that word: Euphoria. so sevita subani has come out over at Bank of America. she's gone to 5,400 from 5K. she says any signs of euphoria are thematic and secular. so we're talking about AI, Nvidia, we're talking about glp1, we're talking about Nova Nordisk. outside of that, where are you seeing what you would describe as Euphoria? I think you're. you're seeing it in, you know well. you're definitely seeing it in technology. you're definitely seeing it in consumer discretionary. you're definitely seeing in com Services- all the leaders that have continued to lead. for markets to really make that next leg higher, you've got to have three things happen: right. you got to have um bread widen out- right. narrow markets die painful deaths, right. I mean 2023 was the narrowest market, only to 2007. we know what happened in 2008, right. and if you go back and look at other narrow markets- 20, 20, 1999, 2021- remember 2021 to 2022, what happened in 22 big negative Returns? what happened in 1999, in 2000? right. so narrow markets don't sustain that leadership. history teaches you that lesson over and over again. so you need breath, the wi out. you need earnings to participate better. fourth quarter numbers: right. we'll take the earnings growth. but think about it this way: if companies, even large cap companies, if their wages are still growing four, 5, 6%, right. but their Top Line- we just saw the total sales number grow at three, let's call it- I can't. I can't have my biggest expense line as a, as a Company CEO or CFO growing at 4, five% and my Top Line growing at three, without starting to lay people off without starting to roll the economy over in that sense.",[207]
222,1eFkjdYK1xc,Citi's Clark Sees Weaker Job Growth,Bloomberg Television,2024-03-08 12:11:44+00:00,"DANI, GOING AGAINST THE TREND HERE. IT ISN'T LIKE. 145,000 IS BAD BUT IT IS BELOW CONSENSUS. WHAT GOT YOU THERE, VERONICA? IT IS STILL A SOLID PACE OF JOB GROWTH, WHERE WE WERE BEFORE WE HAD THE STRONG 300 K+ IN JANUARY. THAT IS THE CRUX OF OUR FORECAST. THAT WE SEE SIGNS THAT HIRING A SLOWING DOWN AND IT IS TAKING LONGER FOR PEOPLE TO FIND WORK IF THEY LOSE THEIR JOBS. THERE ARE NOT LARGE OUTRIGHTLY OFFICE BUT WE ARE EXPECTING THE TREND FROM OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER TO SHOW UP AGAIN IN SOFTER PRIVATE SERVICES- PAYROLLS MANUS. THAT IS A LEFT-HAND CALL: 145,000.. IT IS GOOD TO BE A LITTLE CONTRARIAN, BECAUSE CONSENSUS IS SO CONCENTRATED AT THE MOMENT. IN THIS BULLISH NARRATIVE YOU GO FOR SLIGHTLY HIGHER WAGES NUMBER. CAN YOU SQUARE THOSE TWO AWAY FROM ME, VERONICA? THEY ARE SOMEWHAT RELATED. WE HAVE SEEN THE SLOWDOWN IN HOURS WORKED AND THAT'S USUALLY A LEADING INDICATOR FOR LABOR MARKET ACTIVITY PULLING BACK THAT STRONG WAGES NUMBER THAT WE HAD IN JANUARY- THAT WAS BECAUSE HOURS WORKED- FELL A LOT. THE TREND IS STILL FALLING. THERE ARE MAYBE MECHANICAL ISSUES. WHERE WE ARE MAY BE LOSING WORKERS IN RELATIVELY LOWER WAGE JOBS AND THAT BOOSTS THE AVERAGE WAGE, DANI, WE HAVE PINNED EXPECTATIONS TO 353,000. THAT WE GOT LAST MONTH. THAT KIND OF FIGURE HAS MEANT THAT ALL OF THE BEARS ON THIS ECONOMY HAVE DECIDED TO THROW IN THE TOWEL. DEUTSCHE BANK IS ONE OF THE FIRST TO CALL A RECESSION AND SAY THAT MAYBE WE WON'T GET A RECESSION. VERONICA, YOU AND THE TEAM ARE STICKING WITH THIS CALL. WHY ARE YOU NOT SWAYED BY THE RECENT DATA? VERONICA, WE ARE TRYING TO STEP BACK AND NOT GET TOO OVERWHELMED BY WHATEVER. THE LAST MONTHLY DATA POINT WAS THERE SEEMS TO BE A LOT OF REGENCY BIAS OUT THERE AND WE ARE LOOKING AT THE BIGGER MACRO TRENDS. WE HAVE SEEN FOUR TO SIX MONTHS AT LEAST OF HIRING SLOWING DOWN AND HOURS WORKED, PULLING BACK ALL OF THE SIGNS THAT YOU WOULD EXPECT TO SEE SIX TO NINE MONTHS BEFORE YOU GET A WEAKER LABOR MARKET. THESE THINGS CAN HAPPEN LINEARLY. LAYOFFS ARE THE LAST STEP IN THAT EQUATION AND WE ARE LOOKING TO SEE THAT AS WE ARE GETTING TO THE SPRING. THERE ARE ISSUES OF READING INTO DECEMBER AND JANUARY DATA, WHERE IT IS A LOW ACTIVITY TIME ANYWAY AND YOU ARE LOSING JOBS. THERE ARE POSITIVE SEASONAL ADJUSTMENT ISSUES. WE ARE PAST THAT WITH THIS FEBRUARY PRINT MANUS WITH THAT RECESSION. IS IT BECAUSE TO LOWER JOBS NUMBER AND IDIOSYNCRATIC WAGES RISING? I TAKE IT THAT YOU ARE GOING TO TAKE THE OTHER SIDE, THIS MARKET IS MOVING TO LESS THAN THREE RATE CUTS. THE POSSIBILITY OF ONE RATE CUT OUTSIDE OF LEFT IS APOLLO AT NONE. WHERE ARE YOU EVEN YOUR RECESSION CALL AND THE TIMING OF THOSE CUTS? VERONICA, WE THINK THAT THE FED WILL START CUTTING ENGINE BUT ARE PENCILING IN 125 BASIS POINTS THIS YEAR JUNE, AND EVERY MEETING AFTER JUNE PROMISED THAT BY THE TIME WE GET TO CUTS IN JUNE, YOU WILL SEE CLEARLY WEAKER ECONOMIC ACTIVITY DATA. DANI, IF WE HAVE THE ENVIRONMENT WHERE THE FED CUTS EVERY MEETING AND WE GO INTO A RECESSION, WHAT IS THE WAY OUT OF RECESSION? HOW DIFFICULT WILL IT BE TO GET REAL, SUSTAINABLE GROWTH BACK INTO THIS ECONOMY? VERONICA, SOME PEOPLE MAYBE CALL IT A MILD RECESSION. WE WOULD SAY RUN-OF-THE-MILL RECESSION. WE AREN'T EXPECTING A DEEP DOWNTURN LIKE 2008 OR 2020, BUT THIS IS JUST A RECESSION BECAUSE RATES ARE RESTRICTIVE AND THINGS SLOW DOWN WHEN THE FED LOWERS RATES. I THINK YOU WOULD BE COMING OUT OF IT INTO NEXT YEAR, BUT IT IS ALMOST THAT TYPE OF SLOWDOWN. THAT'S NEEDED TO REALLY GET INFLATION UNDER CONTROL. JANUARY CPI WAS A GOOD EXAMPLE. WE HAVE NOT SEEN THE EVIDENCE OF A TRUE SOFT LANDING. YOU WILL HAVE THE SLOWDOWN OR STICKY INFLATION MANUS. YOU ARE COMING ON WITH NON-CONSENSUS VIEWS. THE GUIDANCE FROM THE FED AT THE MOMENT IS POTENTIALLY THREE LESS THAN THREE, BUT YOU SAY THAT IT WILL MOVE AT EACH MEETING. HERE WE ARE BEING GUIDED THAT IT COULD BE ONE IN AUTUMN AND DONE, SO YOU ARE PUSHING AGAINST THE WIND. WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THIS TIME THE CYCLE OF CUTTING WILL BE SIMILAR TO THE PAST, BECAUSE THAT IS NOT WHAT. WE ARE BEING GUIDED BY LAGARDE OR POWELL, VERONICA. IT COMES DOWN TO THE ACTIVITY DATA. IF WE SEE LABOR MARKETS SLOWING MORE. THAT'S A SITUATION WHERE THE FED THEMSELVES WOULD EXPECT THEY ARE CUTTING MORE. IT REALLY DOES COME DOWN TO THAT IF WE HAVE ACTIVITY DATA HOLDING UP AND WE DON'T GET THE RECESSION, IT STILL SEEMS LIKE POWELL. THE FED WANTS TO BE CUTTING MANUS. IS IT, AT ANY LEVEL, A REAL RATES HEADWIND IN THIS ECONOMY? VERONICA, THEY ARE PROBABLY WORRIED ABOUT THAT. THEY PROBABLY SAW THE SAME SIGNS THAT WE DID LAST FALL THAT THE LABOR MARKET WAS LOOSENING AND THEY WANT TO AVOID THAT RECESSION. THEY'RE WILLING TO CUT AND MAY BE THE INFLATION MANDATE A LITTLE BIT.",[75]
223,er_F0hcJJRc,Nikkei Record; Citi's Livingstone sees 'green shoots' | The Pulse with Francine Lacqua 03/04,Bloomberg Television,2024-03-04 13:18:59+00:00,">>. NEWSMAKERS AND MARKET MOVERS. THIS IS ""THE PULSE"" WITH FRANCINE LACQUA. FRANCINE, GOOD MORNING EVERYONE AND WELCOME TO ""THE PULSE"". I'M FRANCINE LACQUA. IN LONDON, THE RECORD RUN CONTINUES FOR GLOBAL MARKETS: JAPAN'S NIKKEI: 225 TOPS, 40,000 AFTER ANOTHER, ALL-TIME HIGH ON WALL STREET. TESTIMONY FROM CHAIR POWELL IS IN FOCUS THIS WEEK. CHINA SET TO UNVEIL STRATEGIES FOR REVIVING THE ECONOMY AT THE NATION'S TOP POLITICAL ANNUAL GATHERING. THE US SAYS ISRAEL HAS AGREED TO TO A SIX-WEEK CEASEFIRE IF HAMAS RELEASES VULNERABLE HOSTAGES, AMERICAN AND JORDANIAN PLANES START DROPPING AID INTO GAZA. THIS HOUR WE WILL BRING TOP GUESTS. WE WILL SPEAK TO THE CITIGROUP CHIEF, CLIENT OFFICER, DAVID LIVINGSTONE, AND WE WILL SPEAK TO THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF ZOETIS, THE WORLD'S LARGEST PRODUCER OF PET MEDICATION, AND THE CHAIRMAN OF THE ITALIAN COFFEE COMPANY, ILLYCAFFE. LET'S LOOK AT EUROPEAN MARKETS. THEY MAY GIVE US INDICATION OF WHAT'S AHEAD. WE HAVE A BUSY WEEK IN TERMS OF CENTRAL BANKS, ALSO DATA OUT OF THE US AND A NEW FORECAST FROM THE EUROZONE. THAT COULD GIVE MADAME LAGARDE, AND THAT IS TO SAY THAT THE NEXT MOVE IS DOWN. BUT ALSO WAIT FOR WAGE GROWTH TO SEE EXACTLY THE TIMING OF THAT GLOBAL MARKETS OVERALL. WE'RE ON A TEAR, YOU CAN SEE. EUROPEAN MARKETS ARE PAUSING. AFTER THIS RECORD HIGH, AFTER SIX WEEKS OF GAINS. GLOBAL MARKETS HAVE HIT FRESH RECORDS: THE NIKKEI CLOSING ABOVE 40,000 RIM. THE FIRST TIME IT COMES AT THE START OF A BIG WEEK WHICH INCLUDES THE CHINA, NPC, THE FED, TESTIMONY AND ECB FORECAST AND UK BUDGET. JOINING IS OUR VERY OWN, JUSTINA LEE, OUR MARKETS REPORT. THERE IS QUITE A LOT GOING ON THIS WEEK. IT ALL HAS TO DO WITH THESE RECORD HIGH EQUITIES. I DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL SUPPORT THEM. LET FRIDAY BANK OF AMERICA WAS THE LATEST TO SAY THEY CAN GO 5% HIGHER FROM THAT RECORD CLOSE FRIDAY. WHAT WILL SUPPORT MARKETS JUSTINA? IN THE US AND JAPAN, THERE ARE TWO VERSIONS OF THE GOLDILOCKS NARRATIVE LAST WEEK. NOTABLY, IN THE US THE CORE PCE NUMBER WAS SOMETHING THAT INVESTORS WERE COMFORTABLE WITH. THAT MAY BE. THE FED DOESN'T NEED TO BE A LOT MORE HAWKISH. IT WAS NOTABLE THAT THE S&P KEEPS GOING UP, BITCOIN KEPT GOING UP. CARVANA WAS UP BEYOND MEAT. IT WAS KIND OF LIKE THE PEAK OF THE PARTY RIGHT THERE. IN CHINA WE'RE SEEING THE SAME, WHERE WE SAW FOREIGN INVESTORS RUSH IN BECAUSE THE YEN WAS WEAK. MAYBE INFLATION WAS PICKING UP. CORPORATE PROFITS WERE PICKING UP. AT THE SAME TIME, THE BOJ WAS GOING SLOW. IT IS NOTABLE THAT. NOW WE'RE SEEING MORE LOCAL INVESTORS. THERE WAS A SECURITIES BROKERAGE APP THAT CRASHED. AND THAT IS ALWAYS A TELLTALE SIGN. FRANCINE, WHEN YOU LOOK AT SUPPORTS, IS IT BECAUSE MONEY NEEDS TO GO SOMEWHERE AND BONDS ARE TRICKY? OR IS THERE UNDERLYING STRENGTH? FOR EXAMPLE, IN SOME OF THE EARNINGS STORIES BUT ALSO FUNDAMENTALS AND THE ECONOMY GETTING BETTER, JUSTINA, IN JAPAN AND THE US, YOU DEFINITELY SEE CORPORATE PROFITS SUPPORTING THAT BULLISH STANCE, ESPECIALLY IN THE US. WHERE EVEN? AFTER A FEW STRONG YEARS, YOU STILL SAW PRETTY STRONG CORPORATE EARNINGS GROWTH. A LOT OF THAT WAS CONCENTRATED IN THE TECH SPACE. THAT EXPLAINS WHY NVIDIA IS STILL GOING UP ON AN INDEX LEVEL. THE US INDEX IS VERY TECH DRIVEN. YOU CAN TALK ABOUT CONCENTRATION ALL YOU WANT, BUT FOR ANYONE INVESTING IN THE BENCHMARK, THAT HAS BEEN GOOD NEWS SO FAR. FRANCINE, WHERE ARE YOU FINDING THE MOST INTERESTING STORIES? THIS IS A BIG WEEK BEHIND. WE HAVE JAY POWELL, TESTIMONY AND A NEW FORECAST FROM THE ECB. IT COULD GUIDE THE ECB TO SAY: WE WILL GET A CUT. LET'S LOOK FOR WAYS GROWTH TO SEE WHEN THE TIMING OF THAT IS JUSTINA. WITH THE US ECONOMY, THERE HAVE BEEN SOME SIGNS THAT IT MIGHT BE RE-ACCELERATING. LAST WEEK WE HAD A POLICY ECONOMIST SAYING: MAYBE THERE WILL BE NO RATE CUTS THIS YEAR AT ALL. THAT WILL BE A SURPRISED TO MARKETS. THIS WEEK WE'RE GETTING POWELL'S TESTIMONY TO CONGRESS AS WELL AS THE JOBS GROWTH NUMBER. ON FRIDAY. THAT WILL BE A CLEAR INDICATION OF WHETHER THERE IS EVIDENCE BEHIND THE RE-ACCELERATION THESIS, FRANCINE AND A LOT OF FOCUS ON FISCAL POLICY WITH THE BUDGET ON WEDNESDAY, JUSTINA, BOTH HERE AS WELL AS IN CHINA, WHERE? HERE PEOPLE ARE LOOKING TO SEE WHETHER THERE ARE MORE POLICIES TO SUPPORT LISTINGS IN THE UK MARKET, THE FINANCIAL MARKET IN PARTICULAR, AFTER THE CONCERNS ABOUT A LOT OF COMPANIES NOT LISTING IN THE UK AND THE MARKET GENERALLY SHRINKING. FRANCINE, IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO? WE HAVE AVOIDED SHUTDOWN IN THE US. THAT IS A GOOD THING. DOES IT GO BACK TO TREASURY AUCTIONS, JUSTINA? ANOTHER BIG ONE WILL BE THE TARGETS COMING OUT OF CHINA. ECONOMISTS ARE EXPECTING THE TARGETS TO SAY ROUGHLY THE SAME 5% GDP TARGET BUT ALSO NOT NECESSARILY BAZOOKA STYLE STIMULUS BUT PEOPLE WILL LOOK FOR COMMENTS AROUND HOW CHINA PLANS TO SUPPORT CONSUMPTION AND ACHIEVE WHAT THEY CALL HIGH-QUALITY GROWTH, INSTEAD OF THE OLD EXPORT DRIVEN MODEL, FRANCINE. WE HAVE A LOT OF BIG SPEECHES. TOMORROW, IS IT THE PROPERTY SECTOR? MORE POLICIES TO SUPPORT GROWTH IN CHINA, JUSTINA. WHEN WE LOOK AT THE STOCK MARKET, A LOT OF THE SUPPORT MEASURES HAVE BEEN COSMETIC. THEY ARE MORE ABOUT STOPPING PEOPLE FROM SELLING STOCKS. PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR MORE STRUCTURAL SUPPORT. THAT WOULD BE AROUND THE PROPERTY MARKET- HOW THEY WILL ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO BUY MORE APPLIANCES. IT WILL BE AROUND HOW THEY PLAN TO SUPPORT KEY INDUSTRIES SUCH AS ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND BATTERIES AND RENEWABLE ENERGY. ADMIT THOSE DETERIORATING RELATIONS WITH THE US. FRANCINE- WE ARE LOOKING AT PREMARKET ART-HOUSE MANAGEMENT. BRIGADE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT HAVING BOOSTED THEIR OFFER FOR MACY'S BY 14%. AFTER THE RETAILER REBUFFED A PROPOSAL, MACY'S IN JANUARY REJECTED THE BID SAYING THE OFFER LACKED COMPELLING VALUE. THE COMPANY HAS UNVEILED A RESTRUCTURING THAT INCLUDES PLANS TO CLOSE ALMOST A THIRD OF ITS US LOCATIONS. WHILE GROWING IS BLOOMINGDALE'S AND BLUE MERCURY BRANDS VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS CALLS FOR CEASEFIRE IN GAZA- THE LATEST ON NEGOTIATIONS. NEXT THIS IS BLOOMBERG, FRANCINE. THE US SAYS ISRAEL EFFECTIVELY AGREED TO A SIX-WEEK CEASEFIRE IN EXCHANGE FOR VULNERABLE HOSTAGES. HAMAS OFFICIALS ARE HEADING TO CAIRO TO OUTLINE THEIR POSITIONS. THESE THINGS COULD TURN QUITE QUICKLY. IT IS UNCLEAR. WHETHER THE OPTIMISM THE US SAYS THEY WILL PUT ON A CEASEFIRE WILL COME TO FRUITION >>. THE US HAS ISRAEL AGREED TO THE BROAD TERMS BUT THAT STILL HAS TO BE PRESENTED TO HAMAS. WHAT WE ARE HEARING IS THAT HAMAS OFFICIALS WILL STILL GOING TO CAIRO FOR CONVERSATIONS. WILL ISRAEL TURN UP. THEY NEGOTIATED THROUGH INTERMEDIARIES, LIKE QATAR IN EGYPT. THERE ARE OUTSTANDING ISSUES BEFORE THEY CAN AGREE TO THE TERMS OF A CEASEFIRE THAT INCLUDES THINGS AROUND: THE CONDITIONS OF THE HOSTAGES, THEIR WHEREABOUTS AND NAMES, WHICH HOSTAGES ARE STILL ALIVE, THE ISRAELI HOSTAGES INSIDE GAZA AND THEIR CONDITION. HOW HEALTH THEY ARE. THEY ISRAEL ONCE ALL THAT BEFORE THEY DISCUSS A PROPER CEASEFIRE. HAMAS ONCE UNDERSTANDINGS ABOUT WHETHER THEY CAN MOVE TROOPS NORTH OF GAZA. IT IS POSSIBLE ALL OF THIS COULD STILL FALL APART FRANCINE. HOW MUCH PRESSURE IS THERE FROM THE US. WE HEARD THE VICE PRESIDENT'S TONE CHANGE CALLING FOR CEASEFIRE AND THE US SENDING AIR AID >>. THE TONE FROM THE US IS INCREASINGLY ONE OF EXASPERATION, BOTH PUBLICLY AND BEHIND THE SCENES, WITH ISRAEL THAT IS OVER THE HUMANITARIAN SITUATION INSIDE GAZA, MAKING THE POLITICAL POINT SAYING: WE KNOW THAT JORDAN AND OTHER NATIONS HAVE BEEN DOING AIR DROPS. THE US IS NOW DOING THEM DIRECTLY, EXPRESSING DIRECT CONCERN ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING INSIDE GAZA. YOU CAN SEE THE TONE FROM KAMALA HARRIS AND JOE BIDEN IN RECENT WEEKS. THE REALITY IS, ISRAEL SAYS THEY FEEL, THEY HAVE TO DO THIS. THEY NEED TO DO WHAT IS NECESSARY TO ERADICATE HAMAS. THEY HAVE GIVEN A DEADLINE FOR THEIR HOSTAGES TO COME BACK TO AVOID AN OFFENSIVE IN RAFAH IN THE SOUTH OF GAZA, THAT EVERYBODY IS CONCERNED ABOUT. REGARDLESS OF THE PRESSURE FROM US, THE UK, EUROPE. ISRAEL SAYS THEY HAVE TO PUSH FORWARD FRANCINE. THERE IS AN ISRAELI CABINET MEMBER GOING TO THE WHITE HOUSE >>. HE IS A NUMBER OF THE WAR CABINET GOING TO THE US. POTENTIALLY HE HAS MUCH MORE OF A CENTRIST THAN BENJAMIN NETANYAHU. THEY HAVE CLASHED AT HOME AND BEEN POLITICAL OPPONENTS. THEY ARE IN THE WAR CABINET TOGETHER. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE WAR CABINET THEY HAVE TO AGREE TO START AN OFFENSIVE IN RAFAH. THE US IS HOPING THEY CAN PEEL HIM OFF AND GET HIM TO URGE FOR A STAY IN THE OFFENSIVE. BUT IT SHOWS THAT THE US IS TRYING EVERYTHING IT CAN TO STAVE ISRAEL OFF. FRANCINE ROS MATHIESON, WHO HEADS OUR EMEA NEWS DESK. THE UK CHANCELLOR, JEREMY HUNT, CONSIDERS TAXCUTTING OPTIONS IN WEDNESDAY'S BUDGET. WE WILL DISCUSS THAT WITH DAVID LIVINGSTONE, THE CHIEF CLIENT OFFICER AT CITIGROUP. THAT'S NEXT. THIS IS BLOOMBERG â™ª. FRANCINE. MY NEXT GUEST IS CHIEF CLIENT OFFICER AT CITIGROUP, A NEW POSITION CREATED LATE LAST YEAR. UNDER HIS PREVIOUS ROLE AS CHIEF EXECUTIVE IN EMEA, HE HELPS, NAVIGATE THE PANDEMIC AND LED THE RESPONSE TO THE RUSSIAN INVASION OF UKRAINE AND SANCTIONS AGAINST MOSCOW. HE IS A MEMBER OF THE EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT TEAM AS THE WALL STREET GIANT OVERSEES ITS BIGGEST RESTRUCTURING IN TWO DECADES. DAVID, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. YOU HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY BUSY OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS WITH THE RESTRUCTURING, BUT ALSO WITH THE DIFFICULTIES A LOT OF FINANCIAL BANKS HAVE FOUND THEMSELVES IN. ARE YOU SEEING ANY GREEN SHOOTS, PAUL? IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CAPITAL MARKETS AND M&A ACTIVITY, YES, WE ARE. THIS YEAR HAS BEEN A BUSY PERIOD, PARTICULARLY IN DEBT. CAPITAL MARKETS, AS TREASURIES HAVE TAKEN THE OPPORTUNITY OF CLARITY ON INTEREST RATES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF LIQUIDITY. M&A IS AFTER 10 QUARTERS OF MUTED ACTIVITY, AFTER THE BOOM OF 2021, THERE ARE GREEN SHOOTS BECAUSE THERE IS MORE CONFIDENCE, AS CORPORATE LEADERS SAY. WE CAN SEE A PATH OF WHERE INFLATION AND INTEREST RATES WILL GO AND PERHAPS GROWTH WILL BE FRANCINE. ARE YOU SURPRISED? WE HAVEN'T SEEN MORE CASUALTIES BECAUSE OF HIGHER INTEREST RATES. DAVID, INTEREST RATES ARE HIGHER, BUT NOT HIGH THEREFORE. THE ABILITY TO MANAGE IT DEPENDS ON HOW LEVERAGED YOU WERE GOING INTO THIS PERIOD OF RAISING RATES. ALSO, THERE IS A PERIOD OF MANAGING THROUGH THAT, TAKING ADVANTAGE WITH HEDGING AND OTHER THINGS. WE HAVEN'T BEEN SURPRISED, BUT WE HAVE BEEN POSITIVELY ATTUNED TO THE RESILIENCE IN THE MARKET FRANCINE. WHEN YOU SPEAK TO CITI CLIENTS BECAUSE OF THE RESTRUCTURING YOU HAVE PUT IN PLACE, WHAT DO YOU GET ASKED THE MOST DAVID, I WILL CHANGE ONE WORD. IT IS REORGANIZATION, NOT RESTRUCTURING. THAT IS IMPORTANT. WHAT JANE FRASER ANNOUNCED IN SEPTEMBER IS HAVING OUR STRUCTURE CATCH UP WITH OUR STRATEGY. OUR STRATEGY REMAINS THE SAME: THE WORLD'S MOST INTERNATIONAL BANKING ORGANIZATION, AND THAT REMAINS THE CASE. BUT OUR STRUCTURE DIDN'T FIT THE PROFILE OF WHAT WE WANTED TO BE NOW. SO WE HAVE SIMPLIFIED, TAKEN OUT LAYERS AND PUT GREATER EMPHASIS. HENCE MY NEW ROLE ON DELIVERING TO CLIENTS FRANCINE LAST WEEK. YOU ARE THE TALK OF THE TOWN WITH THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE -- JOINING FROM JP MORGAN DAVID, WE ARE VERY EXCITED. HE IS AN EXCELLENT BANKER. HE IS VERY WELL RESPECTED BY CLIENTS AND FOR HIS INSIGHT AND JUDGMENT OUR BANKING BUSINESS IS SIGNIFICANT FOR US AND HE WILL BE IN CHARGE OF OUR INVESTMENT, CORPORATE AND COMMERCIAL BANKING ACTIVITIES. IT IS A STATEMENT OF OUR AMBITION IN ALL OF THOSE AREAS TO HAVE SOMEONE OF HIS STATURE. HE IS ATTRACTED BY THE GLOBALITY OF CITI AND THE STORY OF WHAT WE CAN DO FOR CLIENTS FRANCINE. DO YOU KNOW WHERE HE WILL BE BASED? DAVID, HOPEFULLY ON AN AIRPLANE WILL BE HIS MANDATE. HE WILL BE VERY INTERNATIONAL BY NOT ONLY HIS BACKGROUND BUT THE BUSINESS NEED. FRANCINE, CANARY, WHARF, OLD DO WELL IN THE COMING YEARS. IS THAT AN ATTRACTIVE PLACE TO BE, DAVID? THE CANARY WHARF GROUP ARE DOING AN EXCELLENT JOB ON POST-PANDEMIC RECOVERY. IT IS NOT WHAT IT USED TO BE, BUT THAT IS A GOOD THING, BECAUSE THE RETAIL AND SERVICES AND ENTERTAINMENT SIDE ARE STRONG AND YOU ARE SEEING SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE LIFE, SCIENCES AND OTHER TENANTS USING THE CANARY WHARF ESTATE. FOR US, IT'S BEEN OUR HOME FOR 25 YEARS AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE SO. FRANCINE, ARE YOUR CLIENTS BANKING DIFFERENTLY, COMPARED TO FIVE YEARS AGO, BECAUSE OF AI AND TECHNOLOGY, BUT ALSO DIFFERENTIATION IN WALL STREET BANKS, DAVID. THEY ARE BANKING DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE THEIR BUSINESS MODELS ARE CHANGING. IF YOU LOOK AT THE EFFECT OF DIGITIZATION EVEN BEFORE YOU GET TO BLOCKCHAIN OR AI, YOU ARE SEEING BUSINESSES GO GLOBAL MUCH MORE QUICKLY. THEY CAN MOVE THEIR OWN E-COMMERCE INTO VERY GLOBAL MARKETS QUICKLY. THEY NEED A DIFFERENT TYPE OF BANKING SERVICES EARLY IN THEIR DEVELOPMENT, NOT ONLY THE PAYMENT TO WORKING CAPITAL MANAGEMENT BUT INSIGHT INTO HOW TO OPERATE BEFORE THEY BUILD THEIR OWN CAPABILITY. FRANCINE DOES THAT. MEAN BEING CLOSER TO YOUR CLIENT IN DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS, ACTUALLY HIRING IN PLACES WHERE IT IS TRICKY FOR CLIENTS TO KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON, DAVID, BOTH OF THOSE BUT THAT IS THE FOOTPRINT WE ALREADY HAVE. IF YOU LOOK AT THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR EXAMPLE, AFRICA AND LATIN AMERICA. THEY ARE PLACES WHERE CLIENTS ARE EXTENDING NOT ONLY THEIR OWN BUSINESSES BUT ALSO SUPPLY CHAINS. THAT IS SOMETHING. WE ARE SET UP TO SERVE FRANCINE. WE HAVE A BIG UK BUDGET ON WEDNESDAY BUBBLY IMPORTANT FOR THE TORIES IF THEY WILL NOT LOSE THIS ELECTION. WHAT ARE YOU EXPECTING, DAVID? A LOT OF IT HAS BEEN PRE -APPROVED BECAUSE THE CHANCELLOR DOES NOT HAVE SIGNIFICANT FREEDOM. THE UK BUDGET IS 1.2 TRILLION POUNDS. THE ESTIMATES ARE THAT HE HAS 18-20,000,000,000 POUNDS OF FREEDOM OVER THE FIVE-YEAR FORECAST PERIOD. THAT IS NOT A GREAT DEAL OF FLEXIBILITY. SO WE ANTICIPATE SOME MODEST INCREASE IN TAX TAKE BUT MOST OF THAT BEING GIVEN BACK THROUGH. SOME RELIEF AROUND NATIONAL INSURANCE AND LOWER TAX RATE RELIEF BUT THAT IS NOT VERY SIGNIFICANT WHEN YOU ARE MANAGING 1.2 TRILLION POUNDS. IT IS ON THE SPENDING SIDE WHERE MOST OF OUR CLIENTS WOULD SAY. THAT IS WHERE REFORM IS NEEDED AND MORE CLARITY IS REQUIRED BY THIS GOVERNMENT OR FUTURE GOVERNMENTS. FRANCINE, IF YOU LOOK AT THE POLLS, IT IS LIKELY THAT LABOUR GET IN. HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO LABOUR? WHAT YOUR CLIENTS WORRY MOST ABOUT? A LABOUR GOVERNMENT, DAVID, OUR CLIENTS WORRY MOST ABOUT POLICY SETTINGS. THE UK ISSUES ARE AROUND COMPETITIVENESS, CORPORATE TAX RATE, LABOR, PRODUCTIVITY AND PLANNING AND INFRASTRUCTURE. THEY ARE THE ISSUES OUR CLIENTS IN THE UK ARE MOST FOCUSED ABOUT. THAT IS WHAT THEY ENGAGE WITH GOVERNMENT, AND I SUPPOSE WE DO TOO ON THOSE DIMENSIONS. FINANCIAL SERVICES REFORM HAS BEEN VERY SOLID UNDER THE CURRENT CHANCELLOR BUT MOST OF THE MANSION HOUSE AND OTHER INITIATIVES ARE LONGER-TERM IN THEIR IMPACT BUT MOST CLIENTS ARE FOCUSED ON WHAT. IS THE CONTINUED REFORM AGENDA IN THE UK, FRANCINE, WHAT ABOUT NON-DOM'S, DAVID? NOT THAT RELEVANT, FRANCINE? IT DOESN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO YOUR CLIENT BASE, DAVID. NO, FRANCINE, ARE YOU BULLISH OVERALL ABOUT THE UK? THERE IS SO MUCH DIVIDING POLITICS ELSEWHERE IN THE WORLD I HAVE HEARD THE UK LOOKS RELATIVELY STABLE, COMPARED TO OTHER COUNTRIES. DOES IT MAKE IT ATTRACTIVE, DAVID, FROM A POLICY POINT OF VIEW? THERE ISN'T A HUGE GAP BETWEEN THE MAJOR PARTIES BUT THE UK RETAINS ALL OF ITS ATTRACTIVE FUTURES- TIME ZONE, LANGUAGE, LAW- ALL OF THOSE THINGS- BUT CAN'T RELY ON THOSE FOREVER. THEREFORE IT NEEDS TO KEEP UP THIS PACE OF STRUCTURAL REFORM IN THE ECONOMY TO GET GROWTH BACK. THE DISTINCTIVE THING IN THE UK TO WORRY ABOUT IS LABOR PRODUCTIVITY. WE'RE SEEING OTHER PLACES IN THE WORLD RECOVERING FASTER, POST-PANDEMIC FRANCINE. YOU MENTIONED THAT CITIGROUP HAS A BIG GLOBAL FOOTPRINT, GEOGRAPHICALLY. WHERE ARE YOU MOST EXCITED ABOUT, DAVID? THE UNITED STATES. THE US REMAINS A FLEXIBLE ECONOMY. WE HAVE SEEN THE LEVEL OF RECOVERY BEING TRANSLATED INTO STOCK MARKET VALUATIONS. FRANCINE, THE PRODUCTIVITY IS CREDIBLE. DAVID, WE WILL SEE THE JOBS REPORT LATER THIS WEEK. I THINK THAT IS A MARKET WHERE WE STILL SEE SIGNIFICANT UPSIDE. GENERALLY AND FOR US AT CITI, FRANCINE, THIS IS ANIMAL SPIRITS COMING BACK FOR DEALS IN THE US, DAVID, NOT JUST DEALS UNDERLYING ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND VIBRANCY. WHICH DOES NEED FINANCING? IT NEEDS THE SUPPORT THE BANKING SYSTEM CAN GIVE IT. FRANCINE, YOU WILL HAVE TO COME BACK SOON. GREAT CONVERSATION WITH THE DAVID LIVINGSTONE, THE CHIEF CLIENT OFFICER AT CITIGROUP. WE WILL LOOK AT THE ANIMAL HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY. WITH THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF ZOETIS, A LISTED COMPANY, WE DISCUSS VACCINES, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND CONSUMER SPENDING. NEXT, THIS IS BLOOMBERG â™ª. FRANCINE, THE RECORD RUN CONTINUES FOR GLOBAL MARKETS. TESTIMONY FROM FED CHAIR, JAY POWELL IS IN FOCUS FOR INVESTORS. THIS WEEK, THE US SAYS ISRAEL HAS ESSENTIALLY AGREED TO A SIX-WEEK CEASE-FIRE OF HAMAS RELEASES HOSTAGES. AMERICAN PLANES START DROPPING AID INTO GAZA, PLUS STRATEGIES FOR REVIVING THE ECONOMY AT THE NATION BEIJING SCRAPS THE PRESS BRIEFING BREAKING THREE DECADES OF CONVENTION. GOOD MORNING, WELCOME TO THE POLLS, HAPPY MONDAY. ZOETIS FOCUSES ON LIVESTOCK AND HOUSEHOLD PETS BY DISCOVERING AND MANUFACTURING HOUSEHOLD --, VACCINES AND MEDICINES. IT HAS SURGED SINCE THE PANDEMIC AND IS PROTECTED BE WORTH ALMOST HALF TRILLION BY 2030, UP MORE THAN 50%. I AM PLEASED TO BE JOINED BY THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF ZOETIS. I KNOW YOU ARE HERE FOR A COUPLE DAYS. WHEN WE SAW WHAT ZOETIS DID, SO MANY IN THE NEWSROOM SAID IF THEY HAD TO START BUSINESSES, IT WOULD PROBABLY BE A THING THEY WILL GO INTO BECAUSE OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR PETS HAVE GROWN SO MUCH. HAVE YOU SEEN THE SPEND OF HOUSEHOLD PER PET GO UP? >>. IT IS A PHENOMENAL INDUSTRY WITH INCREDIBLE MACROECONOMICS BEHIND IT. YOU LOOK AT THE INDUSTRY HISTORICALLY: IT HAS GROWN AROUND 5%. ZOETIS HAS GROWN ABOUT 3% FASTER THAN THE INDUSTRY OVER THE LAST 11 YEARS AND WITH THAT GROWTH WE HAVE DELIVERED 625% TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN. SO IT HAS BEEN DRIVEN BY INNOVATION ACROSS OUR COMPANION ANIMAL AND LIVESTOCK PORTFOLIOS, FRANCINE. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH YOU HAVE GROWN? IS IT ALSO NEW BUSINESS MODELS? MOST PEOPLE LOVE THEIR PETS SO MUCH. UNLESS THERE IS A CONCERN WITH HOUSEHOLD INCOME. YOU GIVE THEM THE BEST, KRISTIN. OVER 90% OF PET OWNERS WOULD PAY WHATEVER IT TAKES TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR PET. ZOETIS HAS BROUGHT A BUNCH OF NEW SOLUTIONS. A LOT OF THE SAME TECHNOLOGIES YOU SEE BROUGHT TO HEALTH CARE. SO WE HAVE TWO OSTEOARTHRITIS PRODUCTS THAT YOU CAN GET AT YOUR LOCAL VET. WE MAKE DERMATOLOGY ANTIBODIES. WE DO AI GENERATED DIAGNOSTICS, SUCH AS OUR IMAGES PLATFORM. SO THERE ARE A LOT OF NEW PRODUCTS AND BUSINESS MODELS: ACROSS BOTH, COMPANION, ANIMAL AND LIVESTOCK FRANCINE. THERE'S ALWAYS A COST OF HOW MUCH VETERINARIANS TAKE AND INSURANCE MODELS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. BUT IS THAT CHANGING? THERE ARE MORE MODELS NOW TRYING TO GO FOR CHEAPER PET CARE BUT I GUESS, MORE EXPENSIVE SOLUTIONS IF THE ANIMAL IS ACTUALLY SICK >>. PET OWNERS WANT TO TREAT THEIR PETS. THE WAY THEY TREAT THEIR FAMILY AND THEIR OPENNESS TO NEW SOLUTIONS IS DIFFERENT. YOU ARE SEEING INSURANCE PRODUCTS EXPANDING IN EUROPE OR YOU HAVE SEEN INSURANCE PRODUCTS TAKE OVER BECAUSE THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE IF THERE IS A CRISIS, THEY HAVE THAT AVAILABLE TO THEM. BUT YOU ARE SEEING PET OWNERS ENGAGE IN THE HEALTH OF THEIR PET IN DIFFERENT WAYS. THEY ARE SPENDING MORE TIME ONLINE GLOBALLY. THEIR ENGAGEMENT IN PET CARE AND WILLINGNESS TO SPEND ON DIAGNOSTICS DEMONSTRATES THE MARKET IS EXPANDING FRANCINE. IS IT CHEAPER TO USE AI SOLUTIONS, KRISTIN? IT IS JUST PROVIDING BETTER CARE. IF YOU TAKE YOUR DOG TO THE VET AND THERE IS AN IMAGES PLATFORM, THERE WE CAN LOOK AT YOUR END -- URINE AND FECAL AND GIVE YOU A DIAGNOSIS. WE CAN GET YOUR VET ON THE LINE WITH AN EXTRA PATHOLOGIST TO NOT JUST TELL YOU WHAT IT IS, BUT POTENTIAL TREATMENT PATHS FORWARD. THE QUALITY OF CARE WE CAN BRING TO THE VET CLINIC IS WHY PET OWNERS ARE WILLING TO PAY. THEY FEEL THEIR PET IS GETTING THE BEST PET CARE, SOMETIMES BETTER THAN WHAT THEY CAN SEE FOR THEMSELVES. FRANCINE, WITH THE COST-OF-LIVING CRISIS, ARE YOU HAVING TO KEEP COSTS DOWN? KRISTIN, WE HAVE TOLD PEOPLE GLOBALLY -- POLLED PEOPLE GLOBALLY- AND SAID: IF WE REDUCE YOUR INCOME, HOW WOULD THAT AFFECT WHAT YOU WOULD SPEND ON PET CARE? THAT OWNERS WOULD NOT SPEND ANY LESS WE SOMETIMES SEE THEY WILL REDUCE WELLNESS CARE LIKE MAYBE DELAY AN APPOINTMENT, BUT IF THEIR PET IS SICK, THEY ARE WILLING TO SPEND WHATEVER IT TAKES. FRANCINE, I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER YOU HAVE A GEOGRAPHICAL COMPANY -- COUNTRY UCS, THE EL DORADO. KRISTIN, WE DELIVERED 12% GROWTH IN THE UK AND THAT IS ORGANIC GROWTH. THAT IS MY POINT. WHEN YOU BRING INNOVATION TO THE MARKET AND IMPROVE THE STANDARD OF CARE, PET OWNERS ARE WILLING TO PAY. SO WE GREW 7% LAST YEAR. THIS YEAR, OUR GUIDANCE IS FOR 7% TO 9% GROWTH. FRANCINE, DO YOU WORRY ABOUT BEING AN ACQUISITION TARGET FOR THE BIGGER PHARMA GROUPS, KRISTIN, WITH A MARKET CAP AROUND $90 BILLION, THERE ARE NOT MANY WHO CAN AFFORD US. MY FOCUS IS ON CONTINUING TO GROW THE COMPANY AND RAISE THE STANDARD OF CARE. WE ARE GROWING 3% FASTER THAN THE MARKET FRANCINE. WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE YOUNGER GENERATION HAVE A DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIP TO PETS. IS IT A STRONGER ONE? HOW IS THAT GOING TO SHIFT KRISTIN? 50% OF PET OWNERS ARE MILLENNIALS AND GEN Z AND THEY SEE THEIR PETS DIFFERENTLY. WHEN OUR PARENTS HAD PETS, MAYBE THEY WENT INTO THE HOUSE. THESE PETS ARE NOW ON THE BED. THEY HAVE OUTFITS, THEY HAVE STROLLERS. WE ARE IN A DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR PETS AND I THINK MILLENNIALS ARE DRIVING THE INCREASE IN SPEND AT THE VET CLINIC, WHICH AT THE US LAST YEAR WAS 7%. FRANCINE. WHERE DO YOU SEE THE BIGGEST MARKET, KRISTIN? GLOBALLY, WE OPERATE IN 45 MARKETS DIRECTLY AND SELL IN ORCHIDS ACROSS THE GLOBE. WE ARE SEEING TREMENDOUS GROWTH IN EUROPE AND THE US. I JUST GOT BACK FROM AUSTRALIA WHERE WE GREW 17% LAST YEAR. WE SEE THE GLORY OF -- GROWTH OF POPULATION, MEANING A LOT MORE PETS AND PEOPLE. THE MACROECONOMICS THAT DRIVE ANIMAL HEALTH ARE STRONG FRANCINE. WHERE ARE THE BIGGEST MARGINS? WHEN YOU LOOK AT PET CARE, THAT COULD BE NUTRITION KRISTIN, PET CARE MARGINS ARE HIGHER THAN LIVESTOCK. WE PRIMARILY MAKE MEDICINES, VACCINES, DIAGNOSTICS, SO WE ARE NOT IN THE FOOD-NUTRITION SIDE OF THE BUSINESS. PET CARE IS A HIGHER MARGIN THAN LIVESTOCK. FRANCINE, COULD YOU GO INTO NUTRITION? OR IS IT NOT AN ATTRACTIVE MARKET, KRISTIN? OUR FOCUS IS ON INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. WE SPENT OVER $4 BILLION ON OUR R&D AND I THINK WE LOOK AT THINGS WHERE WE CAN CREATE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND DIFFERENTIATE AND DRIVE INNOVATION IN SPACES WHERE YOU SEE THAT THOSE ARE SPACES. WE FOCUS ON FRANCINE. ANY ACQUISITIONS, KRISTIN? WE HAVE COMPLETED A BUNCH OF SMALL ONES IN MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES. OUR FOCUS IS ON EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES THAT WILL DRIVE INNOVATION OVER THE FUTURE. FRANCINE, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US TODAY. WE WILL TAKE A LOOK AT HOW CHANGING CONSUMER CONCERNS WAY ON THE COFFEE INDUSTRY. SO, FROM THE PET INDUSTRY TO THE COFFEE INDUSTRY, A PERFECT DAY ON THE PULSE. THIS IS BLOOMBERG â™ª. FRANCINE. SOME OF THE WORLD'S BIGGEST COFFEE EXPORTERS. WHILE CHANGING CONSUMER HABITS AND SUPPLY CHAIN CHALLENGES ARE WEIGHING ON AN INDUSTRY WHICH IS ALSO GRAPPLING WITH THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE, ALSO ON THE RADAR FAR-REACHING NEW EUROPEAN UNION GOALS AIMED AT PREVENTING DEFORESTATION. SO LET'S DISCUSS ALL OF THIS WITH ANDREA ZOETIS -- ANDREA ILLY, WE KNOW YOU'RE BRILLIANT. MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN OUR NEWSROOM ARE OBSESSED WITH COFFEE. I AM PUTTING MYSELF INTO THIS CATEGORY. WE WILL HAVE A GOOD CONVERSATION ON TRENDS AND ALSO DEFORESTATION. YOU HAVE WORKED ON AGRICULTURAL WAYS TO BE FAIRER. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS? ANDREA FIRST GOOD MORNING. IT IS IMPACTFUL IN THE SENSE THAT IT PUTS REGULATIONS INSTEAD OF INCENTIVES, WHICH ARE DIFFICULT TO MATCH FROM PRODUCING COUNTRIES BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT EQUIPPED TECHNOLOGICALLY TO PROVIDE GEOGRAPHICAL ABILITY THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION REQUIRES IN SUCH A SHORT TIME. BUT I THINK, WITH A LOT OF WORK AND PRIVATE INVESTMENT, WE WILL BE ABLE TO AT LEAST FOR THE MAJORITY OF COUNTRIES TO MAKE IT, AND THIS IS POSITIVE IN A SENSE THAT IT WILL CERTIFY THAT COFFEE IS NOT GROWN IN DEEP FOREST AREAS -- DEFORESTED AREAS. IT IS ALREADY NOT GROWN IN DEFORESTED AREAS. SO I AM A LITTLE BIT PERPLEXED WITH THE EVALUATION OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, WHICH CONSIDERS 7% OF THE COFFEE GROWN IN THE FOREST AREAS, WHEREAS IN MY FIGURES IT IS MORE OR LESS 0%. MANY REGIONS WHERE COFFEE IS GROWN ARE NOT TRACED. SO HOW CAN YOU REALLY MAKE AN ASSESSMENT? SATELLITES ARE NOT FULLY RELIABLE. YOU NEED TO COMBINE SATELLITES WITH LOCAL CHECKS, WHICH IS BEING DONE NOW. SO IT IS COMPLEX, BUT EVENTUALLY I THINK IT WILL HAPPEN FRANCINE, SO YOU DO NOT THINK THERE SHOULD BE A DELAY IN THIS LAW. ANDREA, THERE IS A REQUEST FOR DELAY BECAUSE OF THE STRONG IMPACT, BUT I THINK THE EUROPEAN MISSION IS PUSHING BACK. SO THE EASIEST WAYS TO MAKE A GOOD COMPROMISE ABOUT THE LEVEL OF THE DETAIL OF THE ABILITY WHICH IS REQUIRED. THIS IS SOMETHING ON WHICH THE EUROPEAN UNION DID NOT PROVIDE DETAILS, AND THIS IS WHERE THERE IS THE NEGOTIATION SPACE TO FIND A DECENT COMPROMISE. FRANCINE, YOU HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS FOR QUITE SOME TIME TO TRY TO MAKE AGRICULTURAL WAYS MORE SUSTAINABLE, MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY. ARE YOU WORRIED? WE ARE IN A PERIOD WHERE WE CARE LESS ABOUT TECHNOLOGY AND DOING GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE OF THE NUMBER OF CRISES WE FACE. ANDREA, YES, COFFEE IS DRAMATICALLY IMPACTED BY CLIMATE CHANGE. 50% OF SUITABLE LAND WILL NOT BE SUITABLE ANY LONGER AS A CONSEQUENCE OF CLIMATE EVENTS. BUT REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE PROVES TO BE SUCCESSFUL, NOT ONLY IN BECOMING MORE RESILIENT TO CLIMATE CHANGE. YOU NOURISH THE SOIL WITH ORGANIC CARBON, SO THE SOIL BIODIVERSITY PRODUCES OFFENSES AGAINST PATHOGENS, SO YOU GET RID OF MOST OF THE FERTILIZERS AND PESTICIDES AND EVERYTHING, AND ON TOP OF THIS, YOU MAINTAIN PRODUCTIVITY WITH LOWER COSTS. FRANCINE, BUT IT IS MORE EXPENSIVE. ANDREA. IT IS NOT FRANCINE, SO I HAVE PEOPLE DELAYED PUTTING THAT IN PLACE ANDREA, THEY DO NOT DELAY, THEY ARE SKYROCKETING. WE HAVE LUNCH THIS, TO OUR GREAT SATISFACTION. 80% OF THE GROWERS WORKING WITH ZOETIS -- WORKING WITH ILLY- ADOPTED REGENERATIVE PRACTICES AND THE COFFEE AWARD HAS BEEN WON BY A BRAZILIAN COFFEE. FRANCINE- THIS IS FOR ILLY, ANDREA. THIS IS NOT ONLY FOR ILLY, BECAUSE OTHER COMPANIES ARE FOLLOWING THE SAME PATH. IT IS BECOMING A TREND. THE OTHER POSITIVE ASPECTS IS: THERE IS NOW AN AWARENESS THAT WE NEED TO CREATE COFFEE RESILIENCE FUND, TO INVEST 0 BILLION IN THE NEXT 10 YEARS IN ORDER TO ADAPT COFFEE PLANTATIONS AND IMPROVE PRACTICES, POSSIBLY REGENERATIVE OR SIMILAR, AND ALSO INNOVATING THE PLANTATIONS WITH MORE YOUNGER AND RESILIENT PLANTS. FRANCINE- OVERALL THERE ARE ALWAYS REPORTS SAYING THEY HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT CHILD LABOR IN THE COFFEE INDUSTRY. NOT NECESSARILY ILLY, ARE YOU HAPPY WITH THE WAY PRACTICES ARE GOING? ARE THEY FAIRER? ANDREA, THINGS ARE CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVING ALL THIS FAIR TRADE AND CERTIFICATION SCHEMES. REINFORCED ALLIANCE DID CREATE A LOT OF BENEFIT IN TERM OF THIS KIND OF SOCIAL ISSUES BUT ALSO THIS LEGISLATION IS ENFORCING ASPECTS LIKE CHILD LABOR AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS. SO THIS IS GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. FRANCINE, HOW ARE COFFEE TASTES CHANGING? WE HAD A REPORT SAYING ASIAN COUNTRIES WILL DRINK MORE COFFEE THAN THEY DID 5, 10 YEARS AGO. ARE OUR TASTES CHANGING? IN THE KIND OF COFFEE, WE WANT TO DRINK ANDREA. THIS IS A TREND TOWARD: MORE PREMIUM TASTES AND GOURMET COFFEE PREPARED USUALLY ESPRESSO STYLE. THE ORIGIN OF THE TASTE IS THE ITALIAN ESPRESSO. THIS IS A TREND STARTED 20 YEARS AGO WHICH IS CONTINUING. SO MORE AND MORE COFFEE SHOP CHAINS AND FARMS PRODUCING PREMIUM COFFEE. THIS IS NOW A ROBUST TREND OF GROW IN EXCITEMENT THAT CONGRESS MORE AND MORE SPACE ON THE TOP OF THE PYRAMID, AT LEAST 12% OF COFFEE BEING GOURMET. FRANCINE: LAST TIME YOU WERE ON, YOU SAID THERE WAS A POSSIBLE IPO IN 2026.. IS THAT STILL ON THE CARDS? ANDREA: ABSOLUTELY. THIS IS A NECESSITY BECAUSE WE HAVE A PRIVATE EQUITY FUND. OUR GOOD INVESTOR WILL HAVE AN EXIT AND IT WOULD BE THE IPO. THIS CONSISTENT WITH A WORLD-CLASS ORGANIZATION LIKE I, LIKE TO DESCRIBE A FAMILY CONTROLLED BUSINESS, A MANAGEMENT LED BUSINESS, WHICH IS THE BEST COMBINATION OF BOTH AND FOR THAT, A CHALLENGE TO COMPANIES PROGRESSING PERFORMANCE WISE, IMPROVING OUR FINANCIAL RATIOS. WE ARE JUST LAUNCHING AN EXTRAORDINARY INVESTMENT PLAN FOR DOUBLING PRODUCTION CAPACITY, BUT ALSO DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS, AND CONSISTENT WITH THIS REGENERATIVE MODEL. SO EVERYTHING IS IN PROGRESS AND POSITIVE. FRANCINE: I HAVE QUESTIONS FROM VIEWERS ASKING IF IT IS OK TO HAVE A CAPPUCCINO AFTER MIDDAY. ANDREA: ABSOLUTELY TYPICALLY WOULD REPLACE DESSERT AFTER LUNCH. MANY PEOPLE DO IT PARTICULARLY -- MAY BE PEOPLE FEELING THERE ARE LESS CALORIES. YOU GET THE COMBINATION DESSERT AND COFFEE AT THE SAME TIME. FRANCINE, THERE YOU GO. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. COMING UP FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THREE DECADES, THE CHINESE PREMIER ESCAPING A PRESS BRIEFING IN BEIJING, WE DISCUSS WHAT IT MEANS FOR INVESTORS AND POLICY. NEXT, THIS IS BLOOMBERG â™ª. FRANCINE. CHINA'S MOST IMPORTANT POLITICAL GATHERINGS BEGIN IN BEIJING LATER. TODAY, EATERS ARE SET TO UNVEIL THEIR TARGETS AND STRATEGIES TO REVIVE THE ECONOMY. THE PREMIER WILL NOT BE HOLDING A BRIEFING AT THE CLOSE OF THE ANNUAL NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS- A SURPRISE MOVE BY THE PREMIER. HOW UNUSUAL IS THIS? >>. IT IS CERTAINLY A BIG DECISION. WE HAVE BEEN HAVING THESE ANNUAL BRIEFINGS EVERY YEAR SINCE 1993.. ONE REASON WHY IT IS SUCH A SHOCK IS IT IS REALLY THE ONLY OPPORTUNITY THEY GET EACH YEAR TO SEE CHINA'S NUMBER TWO IN AN UNSCRIPTED CANDID AND HUMAN LIGHT, AND THAT IS IN PART BECAUSE OF HOW PREVIOUS PREMIERES HAVE USED THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY. SO THE PREDECESSOR FOR THE CURRENT PREMIER USED TO JOKE WITH REPORTERS ABOUT HIS OWN STRONG PROVINCIAL COMMENT AND ACCENT, AND HE WANTS TRIGGERED A NATIONWIDE DEBATE ABOUT POVERTY. SO IT WAS A CHANCE TO SPEAK DIRECTLY TO PEOPLE. I THINK CANCELING THE BRIEFING IS AN IMPORTANT SIGNAL ABOUT HOW XI JINPING INTENDS TO PROCEED WITH HIS THIRD TERM: A LIMITING THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK DIRECTLY ABOUT POLICYMAKING DECISIONS, AS WELL AS DIMINISHING THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT ROLE OF THE PREMIER WITHIN CHINA ITSELF. FRANCINE, WHAT WILL INVESTORS BE WATCHING FOR? >>? THE BIG ITEM WILL BE THE GDP TARGET. THE BIG THING INVESTORS WATCH EVERY YEAR CONSENSUS IS THAT WE WILL SEE IT AROUND 5%. BUT THE THING INVESTORS WILL BE LOOKING FOR IS THE TYPE OF LANGUAGE AROUND THAT 5% TARGET. HOW CONVINCING THEY ARE. AND POLICYMAKERS SAY: WE WILL MAKE THIS OR MIGHT THEY BE LOOSER AROUND LANGUAGE AND ANYTHING THAT COMES BELOW 5% IS GOING TO BE IT HIS APPOINTMENT FOR THE MARKET. FRANCINE, WHAT ARE THE EXPECTATIONS FOR FISCAL STIMULUS? >>. PROVIDED, WE HAVE THAT 5% TARGET. THAT IS WHEN TO BE TOUGHER TO REACH THAN IT WAS LAST YEAR, BECAUSE LAST YEAR WE WERE COMING OFF THAT LOW BASE BUT CHINA WAS REBOUNDING. THE EXPECTATION IS TO GET TO THAT KIND OF LEVEL THIS YEAR. WE WOULD HAVE TO SEE FISCAL STIMULUS ENFORCING SWIFTLY AND MORE FORCEFULLY, PARTICULARLY WATCHING FOR ANY OTHER KIND OF SUPPORT FROM THE PROPERTY MARKET WHICH CONTINUES TO BE A DRAG ON THE CHINESE ECONOMY. FRANCINE, THANK YOU. WE ARE ALSO LOOKING AT MACY'S JUMPING PREMARKET. AFTER, BRIGADE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT BOOSTED THEIR OFFER FOR THE COMPANY. AFTER, THE RETAILER REBUFFED A PREVIOUS PROPOSAL. MACY'S REJECTED THE BID FROM THE INVESTOR GROUP, SAYING THE OFFER LACKED COMPELLING VALUE. NEXT BLOOMBERG BRIEF WITH DANI BURGER AND MANUS CRANNY IN NEW YORK: WE WILL HAVE A FULL ROUNDUP OF MARKETS. WE HAD A BIG DAY, FRIDAY, WHERE WE START RECORD HIGHS AT THE BANK OF AMERICA SAYING THEY EXPECT US INDICES TO STILL GO HIGHER. SO A FULL ROUNDUP OF BIG DATA IN MARKETS. THIS IS BLOOMBERG.",[75]
224,msEw--yRp-I,Apple China iPhone Sales Plunge | The Pulse with Francine Lacqua 03/05,Bloomberg Television,2024-03-06 10:49:46+00:00,"Newsmakers and Market movers. This is the pulse with friends who like Well. good morning everyone and welcome to the Pulse and Francine Lacqua here in London with the conversations that matter. And here's what's coming up on today's program. iPhone sales plunged 24% in China over the first six weeks of the year as Apple's troubles in the country deepened. China sets a growth target of around 5%. that is described as ambitious, As the Premier Li acknowledges. the challenges facing the world's second largest economy, plus the Supreme Court rules that Donald Trump can appear on the ballot in November. ahead of Super Tuesday, We'll bring you the latest in the race for the White House. Also a little bit later. this hour we speak to Hamdi Okoya, the founder and chief executive of Chobani, the best selling yogurt brand in the US. He's spearheading a campaign along with 70 major firms, including Amazon, Bank of America and Bloomberg, to connect, recruit and train refugees in the workforce. Now let's take a look at the European market map. A lot of the focus, of course, here in Europe is also what we'll hear from the testimony of Jay Powell. The other thing we watch for is Rafael Bostic, who, also on the website and in a speech yesterday, let understand that it's in the third quarter that he's inspecting. cuts then followed by a pause and he's worried about the exuberance, possibly in the business community, Now stocks edging a little bit lower. China's new targets have many, many questions from many analysts in terms of how much stimulus and support they'll bring together- And of course it's. I guess the market is now shifting from China to Jay Powell a little bit later on, and then the jobs report also later in the week. So Apple's iPhone sales in China declined by 24% over the first six weeks of the year, pushing it to fourth quarter alone. Smartphone vendors in the country, that's according to the latest data from Counterpoint Research. Now the California tech giant lost the title of China's best selling smartphone maker to Chinese company Vivo, who appears to have done a better job of targeting the budget segment of the market. You can see Apple down 1%. To discuss Apple and China, Let's get straight to Bloomberg's Oliver Cook in just a moment, But first let's go to Beijing, where China has set its annual growth target of 5%, matching last year's figure, raising expectations of more stimulus. Bloomberg's chief North Asia correspondent, Stephen Engle, is following the story. So good morning to both of you, Stephen. how difficult will the target be to be achieved. It will be difficult, And I'm saying that with good confidence because the premier, Li Keqiang, said the same thing. He said it's not easy for us to reach these targets. We need policy support from all fronts. So there it is. But he didn't really lay out any specifics on what kind of stimulus that would be coming down the pipe, because there are numerous headwinds, obviously in the Chinese economy, be it property, which is ongoing, be it consumer confidence- And Oliver is going to talk about that- and the drop off for Apple. Obviously big ticket consumer items have been falling all across the board on the consumer front, whether it's cars, refrigerators, obviously houses, But we'll get to that a little bit later. But there's also fiscal debt issues at the local government level. There is ongoing entrenched deflation across the board. So for Lee Chong, the premier, to set the, the GDP target as the same target as previously, a year ago, is quite ambitious because of all those headwinds And we all know that a 2023 was not a pretty picture for the Chinese economy. They also set a target for 3% CPI. We're in deflation here, so they must be confident that they can reach that 5% growth target and 3% CPI. The big question: and why the markets kind of reacted with a ha and a shrug- is: where's that stimulus going to come from, Right? So, Stephen, my question is: how much stimulus are we actually expecting then? Well, Xi Jinping, for one, has been steadfast in saying- and he said it 128 times in various speeches last year- He wants high quality development. That essentially means they're going to sacrifice some GDP growth for more sustainable growth, But we don't know where that's going to come from, because he is also launching a have been launched in right in the middle of a derisking and deleveraging campaign, in particular in property. We have not seen huge rescues of property developers. We have seen state support, though- and we saw it in the work report today- in the tune of long term. essentially, central government issued bonds to the tune of Â¥1 trillion. That will help- you know, you know- bridge the fiscal gap, because they also said the ratio from GDP to GDP, the budget deficit to GDP, at just 3%. So that indicates they're not really willing to roll out large fiscal stimulus because they don't want to exacerbate those debt burdens at the local government level. So they're in a, they're in a quandary, And they admitted fully that they is going to be a tough task. They need consumer confidence to come back. They need exports to rebound a little bit, But that's an external situation out of their control. But they don't want to exacerbate the debt problems. Stephen, thank you so much for Stephen Engle there, of course, following this party conference very closely. Let's also talk Apple. iPhone sales in China declined by 24% over the first six weeks of the year, pushing it to the fourth among smartphone vendors in the country. That's according to the latest data from Counterpoint Research. Let's get straight to Ali Crook. Ali, is this an Apple story or a China story? Yeah, well, invariably it's going to be a bit of both, like so many companies on the planet. I mean, where I usually sit, in Berlin, we talk about this with all the executives that sell massively into China, whether it's carmakers or chips or all that sort of thing. It's everyone's been talking about a rebound in the back half of the year for two years. It just has not come, And you see that weakness now. You see it in China and you see it in the sales. I mean, down 24% for an iPhone Sales in just the first six week of the year is absolutely mammoth. This is the biggest smart smartphone market in the world. So, yes, there is this, that question, And, of course, Apple is selling a premium product when you have a lot of competitors that have a much better price point. I mean, Apple has been eroding, eroding market share. They're down now to about 60% of the market share in China. They were at 19% last year and they're losing more ground steadily. But overall, you know, the overall market for smartphones was down also 7%. So there is definite weakness that is coming across across the market. So why did rivals in China, What did they do differently that actually did better than Apple? Well, one of the main issues is going to be exactly that question of the premium. There are cheaper phones, but they're also very good phones And there's also a huge amount of effort and energy in China to really get that tech independence and to sort of raise up its own producers of phones. So, for example, you know, there's this question of patriotic buying. right, Huawei came out with this new phone that the state media was really touting, saying that this is really a great response to us sort of tech and chip supremacy and Huawei. in those six weeks, while everybody was down there, sales were up 64%, which is absolutely mammoth, And we should also say that this is sort of eclipsed the story, But for Apple, they have a problem in China. They've got a problem here in Brussels too, with this huge fine that's coming down the pipeline. So these are all things to watch as Apple will face problems in China and more regulatory scrutiny here in Brussels. Oh, thank you so much, Oliver Crook, there in Brussels. Now, later today, Oliver also speaks to the EU commission's competition chief, following that big news of Apple being fined and said to have hit a US government roadblock. Meanwhile, while attempting to sell an AI chip tailored for the Chinese market, it's part of Washington's crackdown on the export of advanced technologies to the country. Bloomberg has learned AMD had hoped to gain a green light from the Commerce Department to sell the AI processor to Chinese customers. The chip is said to have a lower performance than what AMD sells outside of China and was designed to meet US exports restrictions. Not to talk about all of this, We're also joined by Arnav Das, global market strategist at Invesco Asset Management. Thank you so much for joining us. A lot of the focus, of course, is on China, on how a lot of the big conglomerates you know actually sell to China, but also what the China consumer's looking at. How do you view China going forward? Well, look, I think they've had a very different experience of the pandemic than the rest of the world, particularly the West. right here in the west, We had big fiscal transfers. China had a much more responsible approach to fiscal policy And so ordinary people had to bear the burden of the lockdown Right, So they didn't have the kind of income effect that we all got from fiscal transfers. They had to bear a fall in the equity market, a fall in the real estate market. We had the opposite here, right, So you had positive income effect, positive wealth effect. We made out like bandits right During during the pandemic. they had the opposite. So I think a large part of what's going on at the moment is kind of macro. right is that consumers, households, are still repairing their balance sheets and nursing their wounds from the pandemic and from the real estate market. What does that mean for policies? Will policymakers really step in? I mean, we've been waiting for some kind of extra stimulus. I mean, there's a fragile real estate market. There's, as you say, also they're suffering from geopolitics between the US and China, Right, And I think a lot of these things will continue. They're sort of structural, like the geopolitical rivalry. There's also the demographic transition that China is already going through has been exacerbated right by the pandemic. So, look, I think there is some stimulus and they are doing, you know, some measures to accelerate growth, But I think they're they're taking a kind of responsible approach in a way Right. They don't want to have another debt binge and other kind of fiscally pushed credit binge that drives the real estate market or drives infrastructure right through the roof. I mean. so, you know, one of your colleagues was saying how Xi Jinping wants higher quality, more sustainable growth. Right, I think that's right. If they get 5%, What do they need to do to actually achieve 5%? Well, I think that's going to have to come. You know, if they're going to hit 5%, it's an ambitious target that's aspirational. If they get close to it, it'll be because productivity is rising, rather than because of demographics or big increases in capital, that associated with debt, Right. So I think the question that we have to ask ourselves is: where is that productivity boom going to come from? And I think you know they have in mind I, they have in mind the EVs, They have in mind, You know, high tech of various kinds green technology And that can help. The question is whether it's big enough to move the needle, enough to substitute for real estate and infrastructure And I would say, you know, probably come in somewhere south of five. Interesting Ana. thanks so much. Ana stays with us and we'll have plenty more, of course, on China And we'll talk a Fed as well. Much more to come. We have a full roundup of markets. This is Well. Raphael Bostic, the Atlanta Fed president, says he expects the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates once in the third quarter before pausing. His comments also come ahead of a testimony from the Fed chair, Jay Powell, who's set to appear at Congress tomorrow. We're now joined by Noor Al Ali from our Markets live team And we continue the conversation with Arnab Das, global market strategist, Invesco Asset Management. So thank you both for sticking around or coming on. When you look at the Fed- I mean, there's been last year- the markets, frankly, were all over the place where it's been a soft landing, no landing, And they were kind of like zigzagging- Do you feel more confident that we have a clearer path? that was committed in, you know, communicate in what kind of inflation will get and what that means for the Fed. Look, I think we're pretty much done with the tightening process. I guess they put the idea. some of them, some of the family members and Larry Summers, of course- put the idea of another hike back on the table. We think that's quite unlikely. We're probably done. The real question is: how fast is inflation going to come down And in order to let the Fed start cutting rates, in order to maintain the real rate where it is and not have this kind of passive tightening Right? So I would say I think we're looking at that in the second half of the year. Maybe it feels a bit like Waiting for Godot, Right, Because we've been talking about talking about this for a long time. But you know, the flipside of that is that the that growth resilience right. The labor market is, as you note, Right, Very strong, economy strong, the consumer strong. The economy overall is strong. There are pockets of weaknesses And people talk about this kind of rolling recession. You know we're in the kind of camp that says: you know, everybody tries to come up with a cliche: right, Ours is bumpy landing, Not a soft landing, Not a hard landing, Not even what blinder, Alan Blinder, called a soft landing, but one that, like you said, has a lot of volatility, a lot of zig zagging, because, you know, the longer financial conditions remain easy and the longer the labor market remains tight, the higher, longer and higher for longer will prevail And some stuff is going to start to come under pressure as that happens. And that I mean, what do you see as coming under pressure? I know there's there's a lot of chatter about, you know, productivity, which could also change under some policies. We have a big election. Bitcoin was one of the things that people point at. certain Mark Jp morgan is saying: well, this is a sign of frothiness in the market, 100% Right, And you've seen, you know those. those risky assets come off the highs. you know European futures into the morning and, as they've opened in US stock futures as well, Bitcoin as well, all have really kind of. you know- I don't want to say you know there's sort of a temporary pullback that you've seen and dare I say it could it be, you know, on the back of that somewhat disappointing or lukewarm reception that investors had out of China. but also, you know, preparations for a potentially more hawkish than expected POWELL Later And I think that's sort of feeding into the overall theme that perhaps you know that risk asset rally is going to take a breather Now. momentum is very much there. You know there aren't a lot of reasons that are stopping these stocks from rallying, even though we've had. you know, as you said, Waiting for Godot is a very good kind of way to describe the idea that there's not much that's going to pull stocks lower, because all the momentum points to the fact that, you know, we're pretty much in the rally. We've had the Fed push back. Now whether or not Powell kind of sets it up for a more hawkish set up could be quite interesting as well, And that's what we're seeing in the markets today. What's the good news that's left in the economy, Arnab? And I guess this is the only question that markets should really ask themselves. Well, I think you said it: productivity, right. I mean, we've had a resilient economy. we've had growth holding up, labour market holding up, inflation falling, Right. So the residual clearly is that productivity is rising. Some people are even talking about a productivity boom. That may be overstating it, but it does seem that there's something structural changing in the US economy and maybe in the world as a whole, Right, Partly as a result of the pandemic, partly as a result of the geopolitics, partly as a result of industrial policy. These are not things that are easy to get right. Right, And it's actually probably much easier to get them wrong, if history is any guide. But I think the US has done something here which is which is working right. It may not be winning the election for Sleepy Joe, Right, But it is. it does seem to be working for the economy and for labour. Do you worry that, actually, the economy overheats? And if there is a mismatch between, I guess, what President Biden has put in place, why are Americans not feeling it? Well, I think there is a risk, but I think it's just a tail risk. I think the big picture here is that inflation is coming down, Labour market is tight, but wages are not taking off Right, So I think it's working generally very well. Why is it not working politically? Well, I think that you know sort of levels versus rates of change. Right, We're all talking about how inflation is coming down. Right, The rate of growth of prices is coming down. What people have been hit by is a big, a big shock to real incomes and real wealth. Right, They're feeling the level as being much higher of prices And other kinds of pressures that ordinary people feel And, of course, for ordinary people in the US, the margins are not very big, Right, So I think you can sort of understand where the average Joe is coming from, Right, Yeah, And I don't know how this feeds into the markets, but of course we look at kind of the repercussions across the board, 100%. And to your point about the US consumer, you know that resilience of the US consumer has been something that's awfully noted, you know, especially in the tax season. That's why a lot of people say, well, you know, you see that risk sentiment really pouring into those, you know, riskier assets than normal. That's what's been driving. you know the tech gains. Of course there's also that momentum of it, Right, You know AIG and its impact on the consumer and job habits and patterns have really changed the dynamics of the consumer today And I think you know we've had a lot of pessimism coming out of 2023 now and there's so much of it that's been misplaced that I think the rally can continue into stocks. You know, I'm I'm the resident pessimist in my team and I'm always the one that's looking for the contrarian view. But it's really hard for me to look at the data out there today and say, oh, that's going to be the thing that's going to drive us out there. But unless you get a steady stream of data that really points to that pain that you're talking about, there is no point for markets to stop rallying. At least, that's what traders see. That's what traders see until they're wrong. Thank you both for joining us: Noor Ali from our market live team and Art Das, global market strategist at INVESCO Asset Management, Coming up. the most important day so far in the race for the White House has arrived. Yes, we're talking Super Tuesday. That's next, And this is Bloomberg. Now the US Supreme Court says Donald Trump can appear on presidential ballots this November. The unanimous decision overturned a Colorado Supreme Court ruling barring him from running again due to his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss. Now it comes as Colorado and 14 other states hold primaries today, on Super Tuesday, the biggest day so far in the 2024 race for the White House. Now let's bring in Bloomberg's critic, Gupta. Good morning, So. was the Supreme Court decision a shock? Good morning, friend. It wasn't a shock in terms of the actual result. There is an expectation. There's so much momentum here for President Trump. It would have been a real shock if he had had been allowed to run. The shock comes in the fact that this was a unanimous decision At the end of the day, both liberal and conservative justices, both ultimately agreeing that this actually doesn't hold in court, but for different reasons. Fran the liberal suggesting here that's actually a question of whether or not states even have the right to enforce the Constitution when, at the end of the day, it is a federal declaration and that is a power that only Congress can do. Conservatives, on the other hand, are saying that that's actually more of a story of whether or not Trump is actually criminally indicted at the end of the day. So, again, two different takes on. what if, at the end, a unanimous ruling in that President Trump can actually run on the ballots and if he does indeed need to be taken off the ballot? that's only something that Congress can enact And, pretty frankly, Donald Trump is expected to win big today. So what happens to his only challenger, Nikki Haley? Well, that's going to be the question, right? Does she end up dropping out? Does she run as a third party candidate? The issue with Nikki Haley is she has so much donor backing- far more donor backing than President Trump has- and, given the legal fees that have really amounted to him. He needs that donor backing. So it's not just about the 64 point margin of victory, by the way, that he has in the polls right now against Nikki Haley on a national basis. It's also about the fact that if Nikki Haley drops out after Super Tuesday, is he able to kind of scoop up some of the donors that she had And does she actually endorse President Trump for the general election at a time when she's been very outspoken about really being the anti-Trump candidate, being the fiscal conservative candidate? On the other hand, you've got President Biden, for example, also trying to see if he has the backing of Democrats. Remember, in the Michigan primary it was a great example of the fact that several people came out and said they were uncommitted, simply as a protest of a foreign policy stance. Both could be longer term trends in the general election, Fran, Great Thanks. so much, Kirti Gupta, there with the very latest, of course, on the US election. It's a big day, Super Tuesday. stay what? Stay with us for special coverage of Super Tuesday That starts at 9 pm New york times. It's middle of the night. I would still get up and watch it on Bloomberg TV Coming up. we'll look at the launch of Tent UK, a partnership where leading companies committed to actively supporting refugees and their workforces. Now, iPhone sales plunged 24% in China over the first six weeks of this year As Apple's troubles in the country deepened. China sets a growth target of around 5% that it describes as ambitious, As Premier Li acknowledges the challenges facing the world's second largest economy. plus, the Supreme Court rules that Donald Trump can appear on the ballot in November. ahead of Super Tuesday, We'll bring you the latest in the race for the White House. Well, good morning everyone and welcome to The Pulse. I'm Francine Lacqua here in London Now. this week is also the launch of the UK coalition, where leading companies commit to actively supporting refugees in their workforces. 70 firms are backing the initiative to connect, recruit and train refugees, including Amazon, Bank of America and Bloomberg. The Global Ten Partnership is made up of more than 400 companies worldwide across different industries. Spearheading the campaign is Hamdy Olukoya, the founder and chief executive of Chobani. Now, after moving to the United States, Hamdi launched Chobani in 2007,, which became $1,000,000,000 brand and is today the best selling yogurt in the US. Mohammed Ulukaya joins us now. Thank you so much for joining us. This is an exciting day because it's also the launch of 10th UK. How did the initiative actually start? I mean, this is trying to give refugees a chance, but also economically, to be financially independent. Have companies been forthcoming? I mean, I have to say when the light launched that it was in the back of Chobani success, which I tried to dig in and find out what happened here. And in my journey I realized that when we start Chobani from this old factory in upstate New York with few people and as we grew and hired more, one of the most remarkable thing that we've done, after hiring everybody local, is letting refugees was settled legally, nearby towns to come in and be part of Chobani. And the question was then, and same as what it is today: what are the, what are the obstacles for a refugee to be part of a job? It is language, it's transportation, simple as it is, not having a driver's license or cars, or not having the perfect right training for the job that is available, and the unknown. Who are these people, where they come from, what's going to happen? And I think job answers all of that stuff- and what happens the minute they get a job, that's the minute they stop being a refugee and companies benefit from it, as Chobani did, And I I i credit. most of the success of Chobani has been diversified workforce, but everyone can come in and put their best to it. But how important is it, for example, to do so? I know you've had initiatives around the world. You started in the US, you had one France and now in the UK. I mean, the UK is a small, open economy with an extremely tight labor market, right, How much of a difference could this make? Well, here we are. This is the last, the biggest lunch that we had. We had Mexico, 50 of them. We had other countries, we had 11 countries, 400,, as you said, 400 multinational large companies. This is the biggest coalition we lunch to the day, which is 70 companies. Some of them are British, iconic brands like BP, and, and, and, and some of them are, you know, international Marriott and Bloomberg. We have, we have data that 20% of the companies- ten, ten or more employee companies- are having a shortage of labour, Can't fill it And some numbers over a million. We have 500,000 refugees here in UK. Half of them are Ukrainian, Some of them are from Hong Kong, some of them from other countries, legally saddled, ready to work and having a hard time to find jobs. So what it does is connect them together and share experiences globally. and we connect with each other- partners of the companies- and work tirelessly through the years And our office here in UK in the service of companies to make sure that it's a success. Why do you think chief executives want to do this? Is this because they want to do good, because it's the right thing to do, Or is it really to fill a vacuum in the workforce? I think we call this win, win, win, win, win and it never ends. It continues to win. I mean, is good for the refugees. It is the minute they have their back to their life. Second companies benefit from this dramatically, dramatically: Culture, productivity, innovation, you know, commitment for long term, Massive, massive effect. But what you see is you get rewarded by the population. We did a study in UK. Most of the population rewards companies who are higher in refugees and young talent want to join the companies who are high refugees and be part of this humanitarian crisis. So we have this global humanitarian crisis, but yet companies are leaning forward. is really creating an environment for everyone to join and be part of the solution? In the end, you have a companies who are leaning forward now and doing that for business to right for humanity and community are the ones who are going to be relevant in the future And long time. We speak to a lot of chief executives that say, look, it's actually harder, much harder to push a social agenda, to push a, you know, climate change agenda, Right, Because of politics right now. Would you agree with that? that it's actually harder to be a chief executive that does good? Yes, this is a big question and I think no one questions this tomorrow's question. are going to raise companies? They are pure purpose of to make money for their shareholders. That idea is an old idea. Everybody knows it. Now, when you are for common humanity and community and environment, these are not against the business or success of business. The only question is you have to look at all dimension of the business to implement, to truly not just check the box, and you have to commit for a long time And that is basically come down to the shareholders of these companies need to ask the CEOs to commit to these values for a long time And everybody I would say we broke all the records. I will tie it back into commitment to humanity. Do you do worry. I mean, it's very difficult to not to look at, you know, American television without talking about the US-Mexico border, about, I guess, anger or even hate in certain cases, also in certain parts of Europe, against immigrants. How does this end? Well, the saddest part, and I am, I'm a Kurd from Turkey and I moved when I was 21 years old from Turkey to New York And I didn't want to move And I had to move. I had to move And I got a new life for myself And I hope that I created some better world surrounding me. Migration is a reality, is going to be here and be here for better. If it's not conflict, it's going to be, you know, famine, it's going to be environment And it has been throughout the history, throughout the year, And every single study shows- and I'm talking about orderly migration, shows- that the communities and companies and the cities and towns who welcome and create an environment for everyone to be proud of, they get the benefit. in the end, Innovation happens. I mean, look at this country. This country is on the backs of migrations and it creates so much throughout the world and there's always leading And and that's a reality. Unfortunately, politics is politics And you look at the reality in the US, right after the last election and after politics, all the cities and you know the states that they know how the refugees and and and illegal immigration does in their communities. They want them in their towns and villages because always something new comes up and it's the reality. Politics is going to happen, But we have to do what's right for the long term, for people and for communities. And I also wanted to talk to a little bit about Chovanec. So people look at you as really, you know, the poster child of a clever businessman that's made it in not that many years. You've also recently done an acquisition, So now you have coffee. A coffee is an Italian. It really speaks to me. But how are you expecting that market to grow and how do you expect the two to play? you know yogurt and and coffee. Yeah, I think in the US and I had an attempt in the UK- people don't know I was talking to the. my drivers were coming here. I tried to enter in this market and the market in Australia. we had number one in Australia and one day I might have my cup. I love this country. Food is an exciting place. Back to natural, back to good grades, especially the post-pandemic reality, And you know ingredients, of course, accessibility- these are major, major things. So we built Chobani with a very simple idea: Good food is filled with good ingredients and accessible price and available for all. And that idea worked. And now we're expanding. So we added oat milk, We added coffee creamers, which is food and design. in in Italy, in Florence, My friends, they designed the packaging and now we're adding coffee. I think the food and beverage is having the second spring, in my opinion. But is it changing? I mean, we speak a lot, you know, also to Novo Nordisk because of Cmpc and some of these, you know, weight loss drugs. What's the relationship going to be? I think I think post-pandemic people understood the food is extremely important, how they consume, what they consume. I think it's hard to break it true, because these companies are major, big companies, They've been around for a long, long time. For a startup to stay independent and break through it and disrupt a category like coffee- I mean, you're talking about ready to drink coffee. In the US, the major brand is got 43 grams of sugar, that's 30 sugar cubes in a bottle of cup, And that's just, that's just wrong. Real innovation, good innovation, That's what people bring with lack along is coffee that people drink cold. Now, just like in Italy, you know you have your expresso. but there's this new trend: 75% of the people they consume their coffee called, even in the wintertime, even in New York. But can this? can it be wholesome ingredients, very little sugar, Not not too much, And it can be a daily habit, because 90% of population, adult population, drinks coffee almost every day. This is benefits that more and more coming out. by giving something that's a little bit more, I guess, fitness conscious, You know you'll get through. This is the way the trend is going Exactly. And you know we're all busy during the day. You know we're busy moms, busy dad, busy workers. You know what is feeling you. naturally, I think it's it's food, it's well-being And it's surrounded, you know, with friends and family. These are all important, But stuff like food we can make it better. It's be proved that Chobani it's simple, without preservatives, something that we can name and pronounce the ingredients. Even myself, who I learn English later, it's extremely important. I think it comes down to one simple things is: maybe coffee doesn't apply to that, but any food, as I see, we make, if we don't serve to our children, our family. we shouldn't be serving anybody else. Good benchmark: How big do you want to grow? And actually I know there was talk about a possible IPO. Yes, Is this something that's still on the cards? Still in the cards? We have not made that decision. Companies in a very healthy place. We grow double digit volume and and and dollar gained shares And it's pretty amazing what's happening at Chobani. I contribute to all the people that that passionately work at the place. We have no pressure. our employees are 10% owner of company and I want them to get an access to the wealth that we have generated, and that would be a reason I would do it. And second is to grow this company further. I personally believe I'm not big into you know making what- 3 to 6 billion- But as you grow, your impact get grows and you get to do more things, and it gives me a little smile. So we'll see. I mean, we have quite a bit of options. One of them would be that: And what do you attribute your success to? People are really, of course, America, upstate, New York, Idaho. I mean, America is a magical place, but the people, people I work with every day- refugees, immigrants, people come from what backs of background and do the right thing. Everybody wants to do the right thing And the business is a great environment for everyone to come and join and focus on the common goal: make good food, build life around it and make the world a better place. That's not war, It's just having fun. And I could talk to you for another hour, but we do. I thank you. Look at you are the founder and chief executive of Chobani now coming up, But we talk geopolitics and Gaza ceasefire talks stall as Israel delay sending negotiators until Hamas answers queries. We'll have the latest on the war next, And this is Bloomberg. Well, hopes for a cease fire in Gaza have been dampened as Israel delay sending a negotiator to Cairo for talks with Hamas. Now Israel says it will not do so until Hamas provides a list of the Israeli hostages it intends to free in return for a pause in the fighting. Bloomberg's EMEA news director, Roslyn Matheson, is here. So where are we with the cease fire talks? Well, the ceasefire talks, as much as they are a very much bogged down in Cairo. Israel has not, as you said, decided to send a delegation for now. There is a Hamas presence there. There are conversations going on, but it's very difficult to get any traction with that Israel present, as you say. The major sticking point seems to be that Israel wants an update on the status of all its hostages inside Gaza, who they are, where they are, their health and so on, before it agrees to have the proper conversation around a ceasefire. Hamas says that's too difficult at this point in time And so we can't even get to the point where we've got people properly around the table having that conversation. We knew the talks had been bogged down for days. The question is: is there any kind of way through in the next few days? Is there a path forward before we get into Ramadan, into the, into the Islamic holy month, a holy period when Israel has indicated it might be prepared to go forward with its offensive inside Gaza. The real impetus is to get this cease fire done before we get into Ramadan itself. We're also. the US says the situation in Gaza is simply intolerable. Israel denies that people are starving. How is that possible? Well, what we've seen is a lot of photographic evidence that people are in quite desperate states inside Gaza. Of course, when you've got a war and you've got a lot of people moving around quickly, you've got people fighting, you've got aerial bombardment. there's a lot of disruption, And that just means that people's daily lives are affected, no matter what their ability to access food, water, medicine, shelter and so on, regardless of anything else. Israel's point is, they say there is actually a decent food supply, water supply and so on inside Gaza. They accuse Hamas of deliberately disrupting those supplies and not allowing people to be properly fed. International aid agencies- those who have some kind of look inside what's happening inside Gaza- say the situation is in fact very, very dire. Some aid is getting in, but it's not getting distributed well, Of course. we know they're now resorting to air drops as well. You know it's very clear that there is a significant humanitarian problem going on inside Gaza, regardless of where the supplies are going at the moment. More developments also in the Red Sea. What can you tell us about that? Well, we know the Houthis say they've hit another ship in the Red Sea. Of course they sank one, their first ship. that sank recently after drifting for several weeks. We know the Houthis are keeping up that campaign of targeting shipping in the Red Sea. It does seem to type it a bit, but it's enough that most ships are still opting to take the long way round. So they're achieving that goal really, which is just to force shipping to make those major diversions. We also have reports that some undersea cables may have been damaged in the Red Sea. It's very unclear if that's due to Houthi action or perhaps the ship just dragging its anchor, But either way again, how on earth you repair undersea cables at the moment in the Red Sea is a very difficult question. So again, further disruption for supply chains, possibly for the Internet and so on, because of what's been happening in the Red Sea. Well, thank you so much. Ross Mathison there, head of our news room here in EMEA Now coming up evidence that investment is returning to the UK, As chief executives tell us they're more optimistic than a year ago. Be looking at the bullish case for Britain. That's next, And this is Bloomberg. Now, the UK's reputation as a global investment destination hit a low last April when Microsoft president Brad Smith said the European Union was a more attractive place to start a business. Yet ten months later, 4100 chief executives tell us confidence is recovering. for all the talk of British decline, Official figures actually suggest the UK remains the world's top investment destination after the US, trumping even China or Bloomberg. Radio anchor Caroline Habiger has been talking to Britain's business elite over the past few months, and she joins us now, Caroline. there's been some great reporting. You've been speaking basically to anyone who's anyone see. So what's changed is: is sensible Britain back? Well, perhaps last year, if you remember, it was pretty dismal for the UK. I think we did hit rock bottom in terms of sentiment. It wasn't just Brad Smith. Lots of other businesses were very critical of the business landscape in the UK, from Dyson to AstraZeneca, Listed in the US, if you recall. By the end of the year, though, the data and sentiment did seem to shift, And so Philip Baldrick and I did another sort of deep dive. Berenberg, Deutsche Bank economists were looking at the silver linings for the UK economy and asking whether there's actually a more bullish case to be made for the UK. So the WPP chief executive, Mark Reid, saying that actually, this year could be one of those years where we feel a little bit better as the year progresses. We also had a lot of positivity from other CEOs, for example, the CEO of British Land, the Legal and General Investment Management CEO, Michelle Scrimshaw, and also the Lloyd's of London CEO, John Neal. He was saying that actually, the insurance business is looking really positive. He was looking to the US, where most of their growth is, saying that there is a big business, that what we do here in London is really unique in terms of insurers. He was a bit more worried about financial services overall, but even he was saying that he does feel much more positive now. Have a listen to what he said Now. we've seen a wealth of de-listing on the footsie. We've seen real challenges around investment funding in the UK. We need to get that back on track. You know, part of the livelihood and well-being of UK PLC is as a global financial services centre. So that was John Neal, the CEO of Lloyd's of London, speaking to me. He was saying that the backdrop is better. He was more positive because of the government's Mansion House reforms, the Windsor framework, when it comes to the UK's relationship with the EU. He does also- and this is quite important- want to see a two term government. So there is very much a realisation at the heart of business in the UK that we need policy making for the long term And, as Michelle Scrimshaw said, something that transcends government in terms of policy making. So I wonder whether, when you speak to chief executives, whether they think: look, actually the UK is a good house in a bad neighborhood because of everything that's going around the world, or whether they really think there's real progress. Yeah, I think that's a big question, isn't it? I do think the positives are: inflation is coming down. There could be an interest rate cut. Wages have been improving. for the past six months. We've seen wages gain. The Marks and Spencers chairman, Archie Norman, who spoke to me last year when we did the reporting about Britain being adrift and on investible, came back to speak to us at the start of this year and he was saying: look, people are genuinely better off. That's better for the customer, But also that does signal that actually there may well be recovery. Business investment also went up last year and, longer term, there is more positivity about artificial intelligence. Maybe that could deliver big productivity gains for the UK. WPP CEO Mark Reid was saying they were already implementing it and it's creating 20 to 25% greater productivity for some of their employees. Here's what he said about AI. I think it's a massive opportunity for us. I mean, at one level you could say, well, we're large language models, they're all being created in America, But actually what you can do with AI is get access to these models extremely cheaply, because we're a service based economy. It could make our service structure much, much more productive, much, much more efficient, And I just think we have to lean into it and embrace it. So that was the WPP CEO, Mark Reid. Look, there is a bit of a disconnect between business people and investors. We didn't live pulse survey on investors. Almost half of them think that the UK's living standards are going to go down in the next five years. Only 17% were positive. So there is still a bit of a disconnect, but some more optimism ahead of the budget, Caroline. thanks so much, Caroline. head there from Bloomberg Radio Up next to bloomberg, brief Dani Burger and Manus Cranny. in new york We have a lot of news. It comes to bitcoin super tuesday. so us politics and, of course, the fed in china. This is bloomberg.",[1]
225,1eFkjdYK1xc,Citi's Clark Sees Weaker Job Growth,Bloomberg Television,2024-03-08 12:11:44+00:00,"DANI, GOING AGAINST THE TREND HERE. IT ISN'T LIKE. 145,000 IS BAD BUT IT IS BELOW CONSENSUS. WHAT GOT YOU THERE, VERONICA? IT IS STILL A SOLID PACE OF JOB GROWTH, WHERE WE WERE BEFORE WE HAD THE STRONG 300 K+ IN JANUARY. THAT IS THE CRUX OF OUR FORECAST. THAT WE SEE SIGNS THAT HIRING A SLOWING DOWN AND IT IS TAKING LONGER FOR PEOPLE TO FIND WORK IF THEY LOSE THEIR JOBS. THERE ARE NOT LARGE OUTRIGHTLY OFFICE BUT WE ARE EXPECTING THE TREND FROM OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER TO SHOW UP AGAIN IN SOFTER PRIVATE SERVICES- PAYROLLS MANUS. THAT IS A LEFT-HAND CALL: 145,000.. IT IS GOOD TO BE A LITTLE CONTRARIAN, BECAUSE CONSENSUS IS SO CONCENTRATED AT THE MOMENT. IN THIS BULLISH NARRATIVE YOU GO FOR SLIGHTLY HIGHER WAGES NUMBER. CAN YOU SQUARE THOSE TWO AWAY FROM ME, VERONICA? THEY ARE SOMEWHAT RELATED. WE HAVE SEEN THE SLOWDOWN IN HOURS WORKED AND THAT'S USUALLY A LEADING INDICATOR FOR LABOR MARKET ACTIVITY PULLING BACK THAT STRONG WAGES NUMBER THAT WE HAD IN JANUARY- THAT WAS BECAUSE HOURS WORKED- FELL A LOT. THE TREND IS STILL FALLING. THERE ARE MAYBE MECHANICAL ISSUES. WHERE WE ARE MAY BE LOSING WORKERS IN RELATIVELY LOWER WAGE JOBS AND THAT BOOSTS THE AVERAGE WAGE, DANI, WE HAVE PINNED EXPECTATIONS TO 353,000. THAT WE GOT LAST MONTH. THAT KIND OF FIGURE HAS MEANT THAT ALL OF THE BEARS ON THIS ECONOMY HAVE DECIDED TO THROW IN THE TOWEL. DEUTSCHE BANK IS ONE OF THE FIRST TO CALL A RECESSION AND SAY THAT MAYBE WE WON'T GET A RECESSION. VERONICA, YOU AND THE TEAM ARE STICKING WITH THIS CALL. WHY ARE YOU NOT SWAYED BY THE RECENT DATA? VERONICA, WE ARE TRYING TO STEP BACK AND NOT GET TOO OVERWHELMED BY WHATEVER. THE LAST MONTHLY DATA POINT WAS THERE SEEMS TO BE A LOT OF REGENCY BIAS OUT THERE AND WE ARE LOOKING AT THE BIGGER MACRO TRENDS. WE HAVE SEEN FOUR TO SIX MONTHS AT LEAST OF HIRING SLOWING DOWN AND HOURS WORKED, PULLING BACK ALL OF THE SIGNS THAT YOU WOULD EXPECT TO SEE SIX TO NINE MONTHS BEFORE YOU GET A WEAKER LABOR MARKET. THESE THINGS CAN HAPPEN LINEARLY. LAYOFFS ARE THE LAST STEP IN THAT EQUATION AND WE ARE LOOKING TO SEE THAT AS WE ARE GETTING TO THE SPRING. THERE ARE ISSUES OF READING INTO DECEMBER AND JANUARY DATA, WHERE IT IS A LOW ACTIVITY TIME ANYWAY AND YOU ARE LOSING JOBS. THERE ARE POSITIVE SEASONAL ADJUSTMENT ISSUES. WE ARE PAST THAT WITH THIS FEBRUARY PRINT MANUS WITH THAT RECESSION. IS IT BECAUSE TO LOWER JOBS NUMBER AND IDIOSYNCRATIC WAGES RISING? I TAKE IT THAT YOU ARE GOING TO TAKE THE OTHER SIDE, THIS MARKET IS MOVING TO LESS THAN THREE RATE CUTS. THE POSSIBILITY OF ONE RATE CUT OUTSIDE OF LEFT IS APOLLO AT NONE. WHERE ARE YOU EVEN YOUR RECESSION CALL AND THE TIMING OF THOSE CUTS? VERONICA, WE THINK THAT THE FED WILL START CUTTING ENGINE BUT ARE PENCILING IN 125 BASIS POINTS THIS YEAR JUNE, AND EVERY MEETING AFTER JUNE PROMISED THAT BY THE TIME WE GET TO CUTS IN JUNE, YOU WILL SEE CLEARLY WEAKER ECONOMIC ACTIVITY DATA. DANI, IF WE HAVE THE ENVIRONMENT WHERE THE FED CUTS EVERY MEETING AND WE GO INTO A RECESSION, WHAT IS THE WAY OUT OF RECESSION? HOW DIFFICULT WILL IT BE TO GET REAL, SUSTAINABLE GROWTH BACK INTO THIS ECONOMY? VERONICA, SOME PEOPLE MAYBE CALL IT A MILD RECESSION. WE WOULD SAY RUN-OF-THE-MILL RECESSION. WE AREN'T EXPECTING A DEEP DOWNTURN LIKE 2008 OR 2020, BUT THIS IS JUST A RECESSION BECAUSE RATES ARE RESTRICTIVE AND THINGS SLOW DOWN WHEN THE FED LOWERS RATES. I THINK YOU WOULD BE COMING OUT OF IT INTO NEXT YEAR, BUT IT IS ALMOST THAT TYPE OF SLOWDOWN. THAT'S NEEDED TO REALLY GET INFLATION UNDER CONTROL. JANUARY CPI WAS A GOOD EXAMPLE. WE HAVE NOT SEEN THE EVIDENCE OF A TRUE SOFT LANDING. YOU WILL HAVE THE SLOWDOWN OR STICKY INFLATION MANUS. YOU ARE COMING ON WITH NON-CONSENSUS VIEWS. THE GUIDANCE FROM THE FED AT THE MOMENT IS POTENTIALLY THREE LESS THAN THREE, BUT YOU SAY THAT IT WILL MOVE AT EACH MEETING. HERE WE ARE BEING GUIDED THAT IT COULD BE ONE IN AUTUMN AND DONE, SO YOU ARE PUSHING AGAINST THE WIND. WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THIS TIME THE CYCLE OF CUTTING WILL BE SIMILAR TO THE PAST, BECAUSE THAT IS NOT WHAT. WE ARE BEING GUIDED BY LAGARDE OR POWELL, VERONICA. IT COMES DOWN TO THE ACTIVITY DATA. IF WE SEE LABOR MARKETS SLOWING MORE. THAT'S A SITUATION WHERE THE FED THEMSELVES WOULD EXPECT THEY ARE CUTTING MORE. IT REALLY DOES COME DOWN TO THAT IF WE HAVE ACTIVITY DATA HOLDING UP AND WE DON'T GET THE RECESSION, IT STILL SEEMS LIKE POWELL. THE FED WANTS TO BE CUTTING MANUS. IS IT, AT ANY LEVEL, A REAL RATES HEADWIND IN THIS ECONOMY? VERONICA, THEY ARE PROBABLY WORRIED ABOUT THAT. THEY PROBABLY SAW THE SAME SIGNS THAT WE DID LAST FALL THAT THE LABOR MARKET WAS LOOSENING AND THEY WANT TO AVOID THAT RECESSION. THEY'RE WILLING TO CUT AND MAY BE THE INFLATION MANDATE A LITTLE BIT.",[75]
226,AVf642I71T4,"Apple EV Reversal, Talks To Avert US Shutdown | The Pulse with Francine Lacqua 02/28",Bloomberg Television,2024-02-28 19:19:48+00:00,"Newsmakers and Market movers. This is the pulse with friends who like. Well, good morning everyone and welcome to the Pulse and Francine Lacqua here in Paris with the conversations that matter. And here's what's coming up on today's program. Bloomberg reveals Apple is ditching efforts to build an electric car and switching its focus to AI and mixed reality headsets. The European Commission president says Ukraine's allies should consider using profits from frozen Russian assets to buy weapons from Kiev, warning Europe must prepare for the risk of a wider war. Plus, congressional leaders meet President Biden's efforts to avoid another US government shutdown ramp up. So good morning everyone. Take a look at the European markets map. We also have a full focus on banking in Paris. We're launching our newsletter today And I hosted a great event with some of the top bankers to talk about also increasing headcount in the country. Now European stocks: for the moment a little bit of a struggle to get traction. US futures also slipping again. Traders bracing for a lot of economic data in the second half of the week. that will help determine the path of monetary policy. And, of course, in terms of the actual stocks we watch, we look at Apple and Klarna. who's potentially looking at an IPO in the US? Now let's bring in bloomberg's Norah al Ali to talk about the markets. nor a lot of the focus still on that data coming, of course, from the US a little bit later on. I think there's also the preferred indicator of the fed to look at inflation. What are you looking at today? Yeah, absolutely, Francine. And you do see that rates traders are actually starting to succumb to the idea that perhaps the Fed was on to something with their dot plot. and now you're seeing that they're actually betting, that they're betting on Fed rate cuts of about 325 basis points cut, So that puts it around 75.. It's pretty much in line with the dot plot. We've had some reporting overnight on that And you're starting to also see that that bond bull market really seeping into the idea. We, you know we had the New Zealand Central Bank news earlier today as well, Less hawkish than expected. You know that dovish tilt that's starting to kind of feed into the idea, or add to the idea, that perhaps that bonds. now you know they could be getting that, that bullish momentum that we've been waiting for for quite some time now. So nor is there anything else. I know there's been a lot of talk, of course, of Japanese equities, some contrarians and actually what Japan will do next. Is there anything outside what we talk day in, day out that we should keep an eye on? Yeah, absolutely. Look, I think with the yen here, you know, and concerns about or speculation that the Bank of Japan is going to raise rates is definitely going to get that yen in a direction that potentially may not be favorable for stocks. But you know, as you heard from our cover more recently in the other shows, perhaps even yesterday, you'll see that Japanese stocks are really rallying. You know, if you look at- and I did this amazing chart today that looked at all stocks performances globally since Covid, so sense that that dip that we've seen in 2020.. And you'll see, in fact, that Japanese stocks, along with the US- even though now Japanese have outperformed recently- have really been star performers relevant relative to pretty much everywhere else in the world. If you look at China, though, however, they really lagged and they've really underperformed, So you can see that the story there is shifting for Japan. Obviously, US stocks have been rallying on that tech, you know, on that tech rally in that feed, And now, with speculation of us pushing back those Fed rate cuts and the dollar being surging, I think there's potentially room for a pullback, But the idea of momentum is still very much there for stocks And it feels like it would be a fool's errand to go against that right now. Nora, thank you so much, Nora al-Ali, there from our markets team, Let's continue talking about the markets. We're also joined by recent events. global markets strategist at Jp morgan Asset Management, Vassell, Thank you so much for joining us today. It does feel like a big week towards the end of the week in terms of data points that we're getting from the US. apart from you know, growth of inflation, do you have a metric to look at to see whether, first of all, you know growth continues in the US and whether a soft landing is definitely a given? But the US is all about the US consumer, obviously, since it accounts for 70% of GDP, So it's clearly the health of our consumer. but inside that we're still monitoring almost on a daily basis the health of the market, which obviously supports income growth in the US. Inflation is an important barometer as well. We're not seeing that in the West, In the US, Europe, US. finally, wage growth outpacing inflation so clearly does provide a boost to purchasing power. This should obviously continue to support Consumption in the US is another element which has supported growth quite meaningfully over the last couple of years. It's obviously fiscal policy. in an election year, we would expect obviously no major change to the fiscal policy, but the fiscal stance would inevitably, in 2025 and beyond, probably become less supportive. But to your question, clearly US consumption remains by far obviously the most important element to assess the health of the US economy. I mean, there's a lot of questions about the labor market And of course we'll look at the dot plots to try and give us an indication of how quickly or how far the Fed can start cutting rates. It's very clear- Well, at least for now, it's very clear- that the next move is probably a cut. But how do you navigate the markets in this environment? Well, I must say that the market expectations since the beginning of the year have become a bit more realistic. We were a bit surprised by the effect by the 18 December to pre committing 2 to 3 rate cut for this year, which the markets interpreted that seven or eight rate cuts to receive, which was then a bit a bit exaggerated. Obviously, we are, looking at the market, really expecting something like three or four read growth in the second part of the year which, in your view, is more realistic given the economic backdrop that we have just described. So, from a market perspective, I think that of the market movements in the beginning of the year have been more seen- you know, don't know any more- builds on the expectation that we will have massive rate cut later this year. I heard you discussing fixed income markets. It's clearly an environment where, again, I find I believe it's really time to boost, catch, get cash at work and come back on the fixed income markets. when ten year yields dropped to treatment eight at the end of last year, You just to be a bit too fast, too low. And no, we have recreate some value again, not only for sovereign bond in terms of the duration of the credit market at the moment and not only in the US, that are ready to the place to be in the current environment and rate cuts will come probably not as fast and as much as expected at the start at the end of last year, of the start of this year, But it will be enough, obviously, to provide a massive tailwind of fixed income asset class. Is there a danger that actually, if cuts don't come sooner rather than later, then it counts like a policy mistake And that's when you start some of the labour market dynamics and some of the economy unravelling. When, at the moment, you continue to see inflation trending down, We think upon the way in which we, we, we, we- expect to see, But we are still looking at both in the US and Europe and inflation getting close to 2% by by year end. So clearly an environment where the central bank can deliver those, those rate cuts I would say for fixed income market, whether we have three or four rate cut won't make a major difference. If you enter the market at the moment only for the currency, you'll get already on credit markets And in terms of duration, it's worth considering And you know that ultimately later this year and maybe at the start of 2025, you will have these rates get coming which we provide on top of these nice carry that you have at the moment, decent capital gains. So the story is the same this year and it has been after every. it's the end of tightening cycle in the US and globally. Once the Fed and central banks start to hydrate, it is a perfect environment to push, get that worked, certainly in fixed income market and to some extent on equity markets, And we have seen this again since the start of the year. So what's your take on earnings so far in 2023?? There were a lot of forecasts going into the year of, you know, lower returns or certainly lower margins. It seems to have been a pretty good crop in terms of earnings overall. But there's this difference between if you do well and you give back to shareholders, then you're okay, But if you disappoint, you really get slammed in the markets. Yeah, clearly I know when I say that, I think that the market movements in the beginning of the year or elsewhere, spoken in the rate expectation there also helps you, because there really is this promise is based on good earnings foundation too. Last year we saw that especially US equity market was almost priced for perfection. Given this, a boom tech concentration within tech that we've seen last year and we've seen that those tech companies, as I've read that- effect on promos. really you've seen strong earnings growth from that part of the market And, as you mentioned, also tech companies also increasing their dividends, increasing their share buyback program And so- and it's a very central theme that we have at Jp morgan Asset Management- globally- ability of corporate to hand over cash to to to shareholder, either in buybacks or in dividends. Clearly, the dividend theme is one one global theme which is to us very attractive in the current environment. We've seen historically that at the end of a tightening cycle dividend equities tend to do well. You'll find them in the US, a bit more in Europe and you find them more and more in Japan. Japan is clearly a market where you see this reform of corporate governance leading to a higher and overall cash to shareholders. So it's really an overarching theme. I would say to earnings season was clearly good in the US, Thank you. So you see, to the tech sector, a bit, a bit less encouraging in Europe, where obviously it's a bit more dispersed, you have a bit less. We don't expect. obviously in Europe health care was quite so far, but it's fair to say that it's hard for European equities to outgrow US equities at the moment. So if you look at a part of the market- and I'm thinking of the Magnificent Seven, but also a part of the tech in general, it does seem priced to perfection. What will be the support to to some of these valuations going forward? Well, as long as they continue to deliver on the earnings front like they've done so far last year, I believe we should continue to remain exposed to the sector. We should look at the impact of air beyond the tech sector. I will be disruptive for plenty of sector, including our own sector, Jp morgan Asset Management. On our investment platform, we use AI to help us managing or funds on behalf of a client. It will be important also in the healthcare sector. It is going to be disruptive in many sectors. so it's all role as asset manager to indentify, which are the sector which are going to benefit from in the future. No, to speak obviously about your sector, the media sector rely already a lot on air, since many air in terms of production of content and so on. So, clearly, this technology disruption and it's an investment theme which is for long term investment seem as I would describe, which we need to capture as an asset manager. Yeah, No, eye on the pulse muscle. You're absolutely right that the trend for media has been going that way. Vincent Evans, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, Joining us, of course, to talk about the markets now Coming up. why have biggest banks- have the biggest banks on Wall Street- then ramping up their stock numbers? in Paris, We'll discuss that next And this is Bloomberg, Now the heads of major US banks in France, including Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, say Paris is the new trading hub in continental Europe since Brexit. Now, speaking in our Paris bureau, they said the pool of talent and new political measures have really boosted the profile of France. despite high labour costs, Paris, for us, is a hub. Clearly it's our continental Europe, But we've grown from 250 employees to more than 900 now. We had 170 people before Brexit. Now we are more than 400 and we have extended the office open in a second trading floor to be able to go up to a 600 without having to move again. A lot of things have happened already and that's why we have 400 people on the ground today and we will probably continue to grow, but at a different space. in the end, We we will have tripled our, our headcount in Paris between before and and post-Brexit, And we feel that this may go further in the future. What really made the difference is the is President Macron, which is a measure he took to to make France more, more attractive, And also, in my view, what really made the difference more than anything is whether the pool of talent, the mathematics, French school etc. is actually looked at from everywhere in the world as something that that's really that has momentum. The most challenge is the on the overall labour cost In France. the labour market is complicated. In France, you know having more flexibility- something that is important to all of us- And when you grow headcounts in an important way, it becomes more and more important. We are a cyclical industry and that we need to be able to be flexible on the headcounts. You need to tell the juniors, the graduate: if you want to have an international career, you can go to London, you can go to New York, but you can also go to Paris, because Paris is becoming much more international now. Well, the heads of these major US banks in France were speaking, of course, an event organized by us here in the Paris bureau. That's why I'm here to promote our Paris newsletter. Subscribe to the website. Subscribe to the newsletter. It's really great fun. O'Donnell, who is also then interviewing a regulator, was there And it's worth it to understand the dynamics that if you don't live in the country, sometimes you miss. Now let's also bring in our city editor, Katherine Griffiths, who's been following the UK post-Brexit finance and story regulations. Katherine, thank you for joining us. I mean it was interesting seeing it from the French point of view, because a lot of the Parisian, I guess- chief executives of some of these big hubs of Wall Street banks were saying they also need to convince their guys back home. So the chief executive, Jane Fraser's, of This world and of course, the head picks that they need more head count because it's so difficult to get rid of people and they're so much more costly because of everything that goes with it. So who currently has the upper hand when it comes to Paris and London Gosh? I think probably London still has the upper hand. but we've seen all these trends: certainly lots of jobs moving to Paris, but in overall numbers still quite small. But then I think, increasingly actually, people are coming up against this point about the labour laws. So, as some of your people that you interviewed have just demonstrated, Banking is a cyclical business, finance is a cyclical business and people get paid a lot of money, And so, the way those institutions work, they need to be able to lay off people when needed, And you know those people pop up somewhere else. But the laws in France are prohibitive to people being able to do that. The severance pay is just enormous in comparison to places like, say, London or New York. So, Kathryn, again, To what extent is the labor law- So nothing really to do with finance- that's holding Paris back? Yeah, I think so. I suppose that there's a sense of hub, isn't there? Just as London's huge value is is the things it brings together here, the the law and the professional services and also all the banks and the asset managers and all the rest of it, And that's the kind of hugely precious thing. And Paris is understands that, everyone understands that around the world, this nature of of hubs being so valuable, and is trying to create one. but one important slice is is the labour laws. It's it's so key, particularly when you're in an industry where people get paid lots of money. And, Catherine, some of the banking executives here at the event yesterday were also complimenting Emmanuel Macron's policy that remember he talked about, you know, rolling the red carpet, rolling out the red carpet for a lot of financiers and financial services company to come to Paris. How does the UK government compare? Yeah, I think the UK government doesn't compare terribly favorably, at least sort of in the sort of world of kind of anecdotes that pop up about this. So banks feel very pleased with the engagement from Macron personally and from sort of senior emissaries he sent over to London to kind of engage with senior bankers, particularly some of the US banks. come over to Paris and we're listening, What is your laundry list of things that are important to you? And they feel that they kind of convey these messages and they get sort of conveyed to the trust or and and they're actioned or at least listened to And there's a sort of sense of efficiency. I think in the last few years people have felt frustrated here in London that UK politics have been so tumultuous- I mean, they have in France too to an extent- but there is certainly a sense that people are really listening in the UK government, or haven't been. Maybe there's a see, a sense actually perhaps in the last year or so, that it's improved, but also a sense that of people being jaded and wary of not being listened to in the years after the Brexit vote. Katherine, thank you so much. Our city editor there, Catherine Griffith. Now we'll have plenty more, of course, on this story. Also. Bloomberg understands that Apple has abandoned its a decade long effort to build an electric car. We'll have more on our Bloomberg scoop next. This is Bloomberg Now. Bloomberg understands that Apple has abandoned its decade long effort to build an electric car. It's to shift some of the team's 2000 staff to its generative division. For more on all of this, we're joined by Bloomberg's Alex Web. Alex, good morning. So how did we actually get here? It's really been a decade of fits and starts. They started this project back in 2014 under the slightly ominous name project Tides, And, of course, it's elicited plenty of titanic metaphors as a consequence. When I was reporting on, I was from San Francisco back in 2016,, and that's when they first tamped back their ambitions in the space, realizing that it was actually pretty complicated to make a car. They, over time, they then tamped it back. They decided they weren't going to build a car, but they were going to build autonomous driving systems. Then they saw how Tesla went sort of stratospheric and they said: you know, we are going to, But they didn't say: But internally, they decided what? they are going to build a car. Finally, though, with the slowing of the electric vehicle market over the past few months, over the past year or so, it seems as though that's driven some of the decision making here. The crucial thing, of course, is the one time that Tim Cook spoke about the his company's automotive ambitions on the record. He said they saw self-driving cars as the greatest challenge, But of course now we're in a very different environment for artificial, for artificial- intelligence. There are a lot of very, very big AI brains working on Apple's self-driving vehicle. Moving those people to other applications may be more beneficial for Apple's core business, which is, of course, selling iPhones. Alex, thanks so much as always. Alex Webb, of course, will join us throughout the day to also understand how big a blow to the TV world and to Apple This is now Coming up. we'll talk insurance, and I will be joined by Mario Greco, the chief executive of Zurich Insurance, to take a look at how air is also changing the insurance industry. That's coming up shortly, And this is Bloomberg. Now Bloomberg reveals that Apple is ditching efforts to build an electric car and switching its focus to AI and mixed reality headsets. The European Commission president says Ukraine's allies should consider using profits from frozen Russian assets to buy weapons. 14th warning: Europe must prepare for the risk of a wider war. Plus, congressional leaders meet President Biden's efforts to avoid another US government shutdown ramp up. Well, good morning everyone and welcome to the Pulse and Francine Lacqua here in Paris. So artificial intelligence is bringing about sweeping changes across industries And, of course, the technology redefines how business functions and speak to clients. The insurance sector, for example, is facing a pretty big change through digitization and customer facing, but also back end channels. In the last three years, Zurich Insurance has invested over $1.8 billion in technology And for more on this and the wider industry. I'm delighted to be joined by Mario Greco, the chief executive of Zurich. Mario, as always, thank you so much for giving us a little bit of your busy schedule to help us understand the insurance world. When you look at, I know this could be facing, for example, cybersecurity, but it's also how you speak to clients to capitalize on some of the relationships. How, how, where do you see the use of AI actually ending? The great majority today of our investments in AI is on customer facing initiative solutions. We use AI to deliver better services to customers, to understand the risks better and to improve customer satisfaction. Of course, the issue with the AI is: where will I go and what dangerous threats will I create over time? But at the moment is an incredible benefit for us in customer satisfaction and customer developments and that's the reason we are investing so heavily into it, both in technology and in people, Meredith, There's, of course, a large number of the population worldwide that is still not insured. Can I also help with this insurance gap, as it were, by making it more affordable? Yeah, One thing, Francine, that I'd like to clarify, and this is because often I hear discussions on gap of protection and climate. I don't see that. I think people find opportunities to insure themselves for climate. It could be expensive, but it's out there. There are other forms of insurance- for pensions, for health, for cyber- which are really not there, And this is where we as an industry and the governments and the association, the stakeholders, have to find solutions for, because there are reasons why this kind of risks are not insured today, And I don't think I will, well, will help in finding the solutions. I think we need a different approach from governments, from stakeholders, in allowing the solutions to be available to people, And this is a really interesting, of course, topic that also, I guess, touches generative. I don't know whether there are things because of climate change, but also because of our use of AI, that you see becoming more insurable, or are there products or events that you think going forward will be much more harder to insure? I don't think they will become harder. I think they will become more expensive And I don't think honestly that this, that this price differential, is unfair, because what's happening through a, through digital, through computer, is that we understand better the individual risk that some factories, some plants or some houses or you know some specific installations and locations to represent, Which means that all the other people will pay less because they're not subsidizing these risks, And so it targets the riskiness of to individual risk elements, which again is it is fair. Now what to do sometimes will need some social solutions, because some risks could just become excessively priced and too expensive, And then we need to figure out what to do. A lot of this also it's about prevention, And you know we've been investing a lot on working with the customers on prevention. This has been the highest growth part of our business over the last four or five years and we continue to invest on the team of people to do prevention with our clients. Our targets were net zero that the world has set itself still achievable, or do we need to get ready for a world where temperatures have risen by 1.5% or 1.5 centigrade? And what does that mean for the insurance sector? I think we're already in the situation that you described. I think the world is already warmer, I think we are already there And I think we need to face the consequences of this, which makes prevention so important, And it means also working very quickly and dynamically with all the people to minimise the impact. I'm very concerned about heating. We've been working with the number of big cities on what to do about heating of their cities and then the impact on their citizens. I'm very concerned about water shortage and availability of water, and these are all the things that we we are keen to work with, you know major, with organisation, with governments, with individuals. We're afraid in that scenario. So do you worry that? you know the risks? there are more risk of us social inflation keeping on rising And, of course, this is a term that describes, you know, insurers claim costs that are increasing above the economic inflation. Yeah, but not that much, Honestly. I mean, social inflation has been there forever. It goes up and down, It changes depending on the years And it's, it's And we're never going to get rid of it. I don't see today this is a major threat to the insurance results in our books. We have a relatively limited impact because we have shrank casualty exposure, which is where social inflation manifest itself over the past year. So I see it, but I don't think that for us or for the industry, this is the biggest risk over the next year. And as, of course, one of the most important chief executives of one of the largest insurance companies, What keeps you up at night? What are you worried about the most? Look, if I, if I look back and if I think about the last three years, what should have been worrying me three years ago? where the potential for a pandemic, the potential for a war in Europe, the potential for a war near to Europe, the potential for a recession, the potential for high inflation? Luckily, I did not see any of these things coming and so I slept quite well. But this is what. if I wake up in the night, I keep thinking about what am I missing, Seeing what I have not yet understood, that it's coming on us. It is the unforeseen, the unexpected that really a company as big as we are, you know, tries to anticipate everything, But we do not anticipate any of this things that are just mentioned, And this is really what keeps me awake at night. You had a good set of results and you gave back to shareholders. Is there a danger that this is not only Zurich but your industry at large? financial services at large are in a race to give back to shareholders, which is very much appreciated if you're a shareholder, but that means you're taking away capital from from natural investments that maybe need doing. Yeah, we're very mindful of what you say and we consider that continuously. In our case, we have a business model which is run for cash. We want to create continuous cash, And so we think it's fair to give back a portion of this cash each year, which, for us, is 75% of what we create in profits each year. We want to give it back to shareholders. This is our commitment, But we keep investing heavily each year on developments like digital. We keep investing on the skills of our people, One of the things I'm very happy about the growth of the skills of our colleagues around the world. over the past year, We have kept growing the base of our employees, and so we take a long term view on everything we do, And with that, I think that our distribution policies are healthy, sustainable and wise. By the way, I understand what you mean and we're very, very mindful and careful in that. Maria Greco, as always, thank you so much for joining us In London today, the chief executive of Zurich Insurance. Now let's bring you also some breaking corporate news that just crossed the Bloomberg terminal. Bloomberg understands that KKR is exploring options, including selling its controlling stake in India's JB chemicals and pharmaceuticals, amid interest from potential buyers. Shares of the company, which is known as JB Pharma, have climbed 68% in the past 12 months, valuing the firm at just over $3 billion. Now coming up, we talk US politics, as the deadline for avoiding another partial shutdown approaches And, in another bout of dÃ©ja vu, we also discuss the Michigan primary results and what that means for a Biden Trump rematch. That's next, And this is Bloomberg. The threat of war may not be imminent, but it is not impossible. And the risks of war should not be overblown, But they should be prepared for, And that starts with the urgent need to rebuild, replenish and modernize member states armed forces. Well, that was the European Commission. President Ursula von der Leyen is speaking this morning at the European Parliament in Strasbourg on European security and defence. Now, to discuss European and US politics, we're also joined by Bloomberg's EMEA news director, Ross Matheson. Ross, Thank you as always, because I know you're very busy, but I always love your analysis on trying to understand what comes next. How significant are these comments on defense from von der Leyen, Also after what we heard from Emmanuel Macron a couple of days ago? What's this interesting to say? European leaders much more vocal, talking out loud what they were probably thinking for some years, And that's that Europe really for decades neglected its own defense, probably relied a bit too much just on the fact that NATO's existed Collective defense umbrella of deterrence while not supporting their domestic defense industry, is not building their own equipment, And certainly we've seen that show up in the shortages now that many countries in Europe are facing because they've sent so much equipment over to Ukraine in its war against Russia. So real realization that a fundamental shift needs to happen here. The question is how, how do they get an image back into their domestic defense sectors? How do they get the equipment that they need and how can they work collectively more than just using the idea of NATO itself in future defense? Because the question is, with Russia succeeding more on the ground in Ukraine in the longer term, what Vladimir Putin's goals when it comes to the rest of Europe? So do US politics. Congressional leaders have also expressed confidence in trying to find a way forward in avoiding this partial government shutdown. What if they don't? Well, that's the question. If they don't? I mean they're talking more positively after that meeting yesterday involving US President Joe Biden, But they are running the clock on this to avoid a partial government shutdown. And we've been here before, three or four times already in recent times, with Republicans- hard line Republicans- holding up these deals in Congress. If they don't get it, the immediate economic impact won't be massive and it could be made up over time as they get backdated wages and so on. But it has, of course, unnerved ratings agencies in the past and markets will be watching that closely. But what it really tells us is the state of politics right now in the US, the climate in Congress. almost nothing can get done. It's not just this government shutdown that's being held up, but obviously also a big package of aid for Ukraine, some aid for Israel, the question of the border with Mexico and migrants. All those packages are sitting stuck in Congress at the moment because we're in the election cycle. The Republicans have their position, Democrats have their positions and no one seems willing to wait to do So. meanwhile, both Trump and Biden claimed victory in their party's Michigan primaries. What do these results actually tell us about? the mood around President Biden Was interesting because obviously Joe Biden and Donald Trump had a fairly clear path to victory in Michigan From the results we've seen. But we did see around almost 15% of Democrats. those they decided to go for no committed in Michigan, which was really a protest against Joe Biden for his handling of what has been the relationship with Israel, for its war against Hamas in Gaza, And there's growing concern obviously about the civilian casualties that we've seen in Gaza. And Michigan has a large Arab population and they were obviously voting with their feet there. But it also just points to that broader question that not all Democrats see Joe Biden as the best candidate for them come November. Obviously he is the main candidate being the sitting president, But there are those reservations about him around his age, around his capacity and also about his policies, including his handling of this conflict. So it's interesting to see just how significant that level was. Rose, thank you so much. Our Bloomberg EMEA news director, Myles Matheson, Now, of course, will continue keeping a very close eye on US politics and a possible government shutdown to Nigeria. Also in the country, Central bank has delivered a jumbo rate hike to tackle runaway inflation and stem the collapse in the country's currency. We're now joined by Bloomberg's Andre Ganga in Kigali. Just how bad is Nigeria's inflation crisis? It really is, because the cost of basic goods and services are skyrocketing. Inflation is at 29.9%, with food inflation at 35.4%, And the trickle down effect is: Nigerians cannot afford to put a plate of jollof on the table because the cost of rice per kilogram has increased 98%, Onions 97. Tomatoes 81%, in a country where 40% live below the poverty line. And in acknowledging this, the central bank Governor Limited also attributed it to high cost of energy. He also pointed a finger of blame at insecurity in food producing regions and also pass through effects of the exchange rate. This explains why we saw that jumbo rate hike: to try and mop up excess liquidity, Also to try and ensure that they bring down inflation, manage the volatility of the currency. But until that happens, Nigerians will be out in the streets continuing to protest the high cost of living. Thank you so much And your Ganga there. on the very latest, of course, in Nigeria Coming up, Massey says its plans to close almost a third of its US locations. Well, we have the details. next, And this is Bloomberg, Fashion is quick, easy, easy to change, Like in the kind of aesthetic. it's very difficult to change a system Right, And I think that that comes down to who makes decisions, And the people that make decisions in fashion don't typically look like me. They aren't typically women all the time. When we look at who's at the helm at the Big East High Street players, it tends to be the same type of people, And so I honestly think there's a lot of work to be done. Progress is definitely happened, but you only have to look at the last, like New York Fashion Week, which is the biggest and the most commercial, to see that you know there's so much tokenism around what inclusivity really means, And I think that, especially when it comes to size, we're back where we were 20 or 30 years ago, when you'd have one single black model that would walk down the catwalk. Now we're in that same situation where, you know- I can't remember the stat, but I think it's- less than 3% of models that came down the catwalk were about the size 12.. I mean, a size 12 is like less than average, And so there's just so much work to be done there, And it almost size is the last allowed taboo. Well, that was, I'm agreed to, the chief executive and co-founder of the inclusive fashion brand Good American. She's also the founding partner of Shapewear, a label Skims, which was valued at $4 billion last year. Now you can see that full interview on Leaders with Locke at 9:30 pm in New York today and then tomorrow at 6:30 pm in London. we discuss her rise to the top, how she measures success and why diversity remains elusive in the world of fashion, So you don't want to miss it. She was really an inspiring conversation. Now some big retail news out of the US. as Macy's says, it plans to close almost a third of its US locations. That's as the department store chain tries to fight off a pair of activist firms seeking to buy the company. Meanwhile, Lowe's says its sales will fall further this year as consumers continue to hold off from sprucing up their homes amid higher mortgage rates. Now let's go now to bloomberg's. dasha of on yourself, Dasha. thank you for joining us at macy's and lowe's, Neither painting a very positive picture in the US. Is there any reason to be positive? That's right, It's not. it's not looking great, But I guess the very different situations and Macy's case- it is trying to make the case that it's better off as a retail and long term with its physical stores and it's trying to kind of bridge that gap between the valuation- that enormous, up to $8 billion valuation- of its real estate assets, And then you know where it's, where it's trading on the market and in this way fight the very, the very aggressive effort to take it over by all accounts. But I think in terms of the consumer, I think in low, low we see that there's just a lot of uncertainty And I think in the past, when interest rates have been high, people would actually renovate their homes instead of moving. Now it seems like you're not even seeing that people are extremely cautious and that caution is expected to extend into this year. It's also expected to see declines. The consumer goods company Nurofen Manufacturer Reckitt also missed sales estimates. It's now forecasting weaker growth. What does this tell us about Europe's consumer landscape? Absolutely, I mean, I think with. the incredible thing is that so many different things went wrong And I think it's got all of these external factors. particularly in the US has got an issue with coming off that boom that it experienced because of formula shortages. So its formula was in very high demand, but now it's dealing with increased regulation in that market. It had an early cold and flu season back in 2022, which has, you know, made 2023 look weak, as all of these things are happening at the same time. But I think fundamentally what it's seeing is that price rises are coming off, but volumes are continuing to fall. It's the more extreme version of what other other consumer goods groups are grappling with, because they are actually beginning to turn things around and volume to come back to growth. But Reckitt, because of this plethora of issues, including those will say, the Middle East, where revenue was lower than expected because, because, because local staff were misrepresenting it. Even so, there's all of these different issues, but also consumer issues underlying them, Dasha. thank you so much. as always. Dasha, A funny and safe now Coming up. we'll have plenty more, of course, from Paris. Also, be sure to subscribe to our new Paris Edition newsletter. That's why we're in Paris today.

ADP doesn't contain government jobs, so they're not going to match up exactly, but the track record is they've been way off in recent months, of course: 107,000 last time and we got 353,000 for January payrolls. the other news that they put into this is their new pay numbers and the median change in annual pay for job stayers: 5.1%, for job Changers 7.6%. so not a lot of slowing in that. it'll be interesting to see how this Compares with what we get on Friday guys, because of course the FED would be looking numbers more like adps than what we've been getting from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",[90]

I mean, I would take it first from small cap, which has been, you know, a relative underperformer, battered and bruised. but I think you do have to lighten up if, if you've enjoyed 24% return over the last four months, which is what you've gotten- November, December, January, February- four months, right, that is impressive. you'd be wise to take a little profit there to the conversation you were having earlier. remember and recall um Sage words. wisdom says bull markets die in Euphoria, right, um to the point. there is no downside that anybody sees at this point. there is. we are starting to approach a little bit of euphoria here and I think you have to set that context correctly. let's get into that word: Euphoria. so sevita subani has come out over at Bank of America. she's gone to 5400 from 5K. she says any signs of euphoria are thematic and secular. so we're talking about AI, Nvidia, we're talking about gp1, we're talking about Nova Nordisk. outside of that, where are you seeing what you would describe as Euphoria? I think you're. you're seeing it in, you know. you're definitely seeing it in technology. you're definitely seeing it in consumer discretionary. you're definitely seeing in com Services- all the leaders that have continued to lead for markets to really make that next leg higher. you've got to have three things happen: right. you got to have um bread widen out- right. narrow markets die painful deaths, right. I mean 2023 was the narrowest market, only to 2007. we know what happened in 2008, right. and if you go back and look at other narrow markets- 20, 20, 1999, 2021- remember 2021 to 2022- what happened in 22 big negative Returns? what happened in 1999, in 2000? right. so narrow markets don't sustain that leadership. history teaches you that lesson over and over again. so you need breath, the wi out. you need earnings to participate better. fourth quarter numbers: right. we'll take the earnings growth. but think about it this way: if companies, even large cap companies, if their wages are still growing four, 5, 6%, right. but their Top Line- we just saw the total sales number grow at three, let's call it- I can't. I can't have my biggest expense line as a, as a Company CEO or CFO growing at 4, five% and my Top Line growing at three, without starting to lay people off without starting to roll the economy over in that sense.",[207]
229,2PCUTSCfhXo,Apple Wants to Make More Wearable Devices,Bloomberg Television,2024-02-26 15:20:51+00:00,"What are you hearing and how seriously should we take some of these considerations? Yeah, thank you for having me. So what I'm hearing is Apple is looking at all sorts of new wearable devices to augment the AirPods and the Vision Pro and the Apple Watch. One thing they looked at a few years ago was a smart ring similar to what Samsung introduced formally this week, But I don't actually believe the Smart ring is currently still in development or something that Apple is planning at this point to bring to market. But more interestingly are how they can blend AR- And I imagine you had warm air devices right- And so one consideration is smart glasses- not a AR glasses, but smart glasses with clear lenses but that use special speakers and external cameras that use a AI right in voice control. The cameras can see what you're looking at and then you can use your voice to help understand your surroundings, So you can use your voice sort of like you normally would with with Siri, And there would be a sort of upgraded type of AirPods with better battery life and new sensors. The other thing they're looking at is simply adding that same technology into AirPods, So having AirPods with cameras in it so they could identify your surroundings and you can use all sorts of AI and air features with that. It's really have a better understanding of the world around you. Now, ultimately, like I said, I don't think the ring is going to come to market. I do believe the AirPods will get cameras and additional sensors. however, one day- and I do believe they're taking a very close look- if they're going to release sort of non ar display glasses as a stepping stone to those eventually coming out, probably five years from now. So, Mark, do they compliment the iPhone or replace it? Yeah, I think all of these products are complementary products to the iPhone. I think there was a lot of discussion a few years ago about the idea of augmented reality glasses replacing the iPhone. My take on that has changed. I don't necessarily think the iPhone is going to go anywhere, Just like people thought that iPads and and bigger smartphones would cannibalize laptops. Right, Laptops have gone absolutely nowhere. But will they change in form factor? Will the phone eventually become the laptop? I think that everyone is going to still carry phones for decades to come. You still need that sort of main device. You need that product with that bigger display. But AR glasses will eventually arrive and to augment that, I think the bigger shift is going to be from, perhaps, the watch or the ring that some people are doing, So more of those head worn portable products. I'm just sitting here trying to imagine a world where people are even more distracted and separated from other people in the reality and then instead kind of communicating with them in some sort of technological or metaverse, if you will, that's been left for dead. I mean, is that the reality that we're talking about? when some people were talking about the idea that some of these wearables would replace the need to be glued to a screen, but you're saying: that's not it at all. This is just another way to reach the metaverse. You know, I don't think the metaverse is influenced here. I don't think this has much to do with the metaverse. I think that the alternate vision are these augmented reality glasses. This won't be in the next two years. This won't be under 5000 dollars. This is going to be five years from now and very expensive, The idea being that you're getting all that information you normally get on an Apple Watch into your fields of view, And I think there's room for multiple products. Right, I think there's room for the Vision Pro at home as sort of a entertainment and content consumption device, maybe as a computer replacement- Right. I think that's a very viable situation. And then on the go- right. Instead of normally using your Apple Watch as you're out and about, you have those augmented reality glasses. You can use them to do your music playback. You can use them to do your voice control, your text messages, your phone calls on the go- things you normally use for a phone as you're walking down the street or you're walking amongst the office- Right. Whereas maybe you would use the phone when you're sitting down for a little bit more complex task. And if you want to get real work done, maybe you're using a Vision pro or an iPad or a laptop or some such. But the big idea is that all of these products need to work together and integrate, And Apple is not going to let each product cannibalize each other. They're going to leave room for the products to work better together, because they technically want consumers to own everything. They don't want you to choose between one product or another. They want you to have a watch on your wrist, glasses on your face, a phone in your pocket- Right. A vision pro at home to do more. a laptop do even more than that, Maybe an iPad for the airplane? Well, if you're buying the glasses, why would you need to buy the Vision Pro? Is it that much? Would it be that much better? Well, there would be different use cases. right, The glasses would be an augmented reality only product. It wouldn't be all encompassing, It wouldn't be extraordinarily immersive, Like the Vision Pro is right. So if you need to sit down to watch a movie, you're going to want to use a vision pro versus a AR glasses. The other thing is: is computing performance right? The glasses will have enough performance. that has to be balanced enough to have proper battery life. Right, So you would wear those throughout the day. But if you want to get real work done, you need better performance. to do photo editing or video editing or to watch a 3D movie, You're going to need the Vision Pro. So they are two distinct products. Because you know Tim Cook and Mark Zuckerberg aren't the best of friends. Do you see Matt and Apple being bigger competitors with each other in the years to come? Absolutely. I think that mirror has taken sort of the Android and the Google role in this exciting world. You know Android has not shown their extroversion yet. I expect them to do that this year at the earliest, by next year and the beginning of next year at the very latest. But certainly, you know, the big approach that matter should be taking is looking to license some of their hardware patents, some of their expertise, some of their operating system to third parties and get the metal operating system into services and platform on to as many third party devices as possible, just like Android did with their, with their smartphone approach, And Apple is going to continue to release their own first party devices and create everything in-house. So yeah, I certainly see them in a battle for years to come. Metal is way closer than apple to bringing AR glasses to market. Apple is probably five years from now, but the reality is you need to balance high quality displays, processing performance and battery life, And that takes time, And Metta has simply, just you know, been at this a little bit longer and more extensively than Apple. Apple, obviously their headset launched a decade nearly after Oculus, which may require to build its first devices. So, yeah, but at the same time, Apple's done pretty well for a first generation product. There's two dimensions to this story that I'd love to continue discussing. One I know Lisa is interested in, and it's data: how Apple manages that story against, say, a matter. the other one- and you alluded to it, Mark- what has happened to Google as a company? So Alphabet? why are they at the forefront of these conversations in a way that we would have imagined they would be a few years ago? Yeah, the Google question is certainly interesting One. it is a head scratcher. They had such a strong hold over the smartphone market with Android and it is a big, colossal failure for the Google. I think that they completely missed the boat on an augmented reality or virtual reality or mixed reality operating system. They worked on it for many years. They were really at the forefront of this, but they really missed out. What they really needed to do was sort of create this extra equivalent to Android and licensed it to as many headset makers as possible. Right now, they're working with Samsung on a mixed reality headset for release, I believe, early 2025. that they believe will compete with the Vision Pro, But at this point, I think it's too little, too late. Their best bet- and I don't anticipate this necessarily happening- is figuring out a way to partner with Metta and going in it together, because they are so behind at this point. Now, one fun fact is that the Metta X, our operating system, is based on Android, so a lot of the underpinnings are there. It's just about how they decide to bring such a partnership to market and against this particular collection. The interesting thing about Apple is that what you're doing on the devices is kept on the device, whereas we're not sure how Metta is handling that data.",[1]
230,Dn66jS0t7Jo,Chinese Top Officials Defend 'Around 5%' Economic Growth Target,Bloomberg Television,2024-03-07 00:10:34+00:00,"[CC may contain inaccuracies]. Last year we cut the reserve- the required reserve ratio, or are twice- by 25 basis points each. Last month it was cut by another 50 basis points. That means we released about Â¥1 trillion in long term liquidity at a time. At present, the statutory reserve ratio is 7% on average and there is still room for future cuts. Obviously, Governor Pangong Xiang there, who sees a possibility of multiple cuts for Chinese banks, and he, along with China's finance and commerce chiefs, have defended Beijing's plan to grow the economy by around 5% this year. Greater China senior executive editor, John Liu joins us now from the capital And clearly the overwhelming reaction from markets and economists have been that this is a hugely ambitious goal without the fiscal intention to back it up. What are we hearing from Beijing? Well, I think what we're hearing from Beijing is an attempt to explain how they're going to get to that 5%. As you said, Heidi, that is the big question being asked by finance, by markets. We we saw the 5% goal, but we also saw the government keep its deficit at about 3%, So there's not going to be a lot of additional fiscal spending. Where is this growth going to come from? We heard from the central bank governor, There could be more monetary loosening, the RR cuts. We also heard from the head of the National Planning Agency that China is going to try and push, accelerate urbanization by issuing more hookahs, the permits that allow rural residents to move to the city and enjoy the same social benefits that urban dwellers would themselves. And John, at that same press conference we heard from other government officials or policymakers as well, just talking about China's exports and what we've seen so far in the first two months of the year. Just talk us through the numbers and also the significance of that Again that once again we're having economic data being sort of front run ahead of the actual official release. So we are expecting an increase in trade, in exports, for the first two months of this year, so January and February, That being announced by the Commerce Minister before the official data was released. I believe that's supposed to be coming today. Maybe I might be wrong, I need to double check, But but I think it underlines this change in approach from government officials here. We had an hour cut announced by the central bank governor before that was made official. We had the premier announcing what GDP growth for 2023 was before that came out officially. It seems like the government officials are realizing, if they announce these figures with a bit of surprise, when it comes to time, it comes the timing They get more bang for their buck.",[107]
231,nUX92uIRDVA,"Warren on Shutdown, Interest Rates, Kroger-Albertsons Deal",Bloomberg Television,2024-02-27 22:38:34+00:00,"with us now in Washington DC. the senior senator from Massachusetts, Senator Elizabeth Warren, is with us. it's great to see you, Senator. welcome, thank here at Bloomberg, of course, uh, we've had some big news about antitrust this week that we're looking forward to talking with you about, but we're also getting a lot of questions about whether the government is going to start shutting down on Friday. I realize you might not have the answer to that, but there's an effort underway right now- I guess a last ditch following this meeting at the white house, uh, with the four leaders- to get something done. uh, we're hearing from Mitch McConnell's office that there could be a minius that comes up for a vote. would you support that to keep the government? yes, look, can I just be clear? this is the craziest kind of negotiation you would ever see, and that is that, as far as I can tell, everybody wants deal: keep the government open. we've all agreed on what the numbers are. it's a budget deal, right, and everyone's agreed on it, and the Republicans in the house are just saying no. and it's hard to sit down and negotiate with somebody when you said, because you want what, and then some crazy thing flies in that the majority of Republicans don't even want much less that you'll get Democrats on. so we're kind of in this. shut down the government. for what purpose? what are the Republicans trying to accomplish here? it's a kind of dysfunction. that is not about Democrats and Republicans fighting each other, it's just Republicans who just can't seem to get their act together so that we do the most basic, basic, basic job of government, and that is, fund it and keep it going well. the goalposts, as we keep hearing, are moving on a couple of matters, including this supplemental emergency funding request for Ukraine, for Israel, for Taiwan- there's an effort in the house now to subvert the speaker. that involves Democrats and Republicans- a discharge petition that would bring defense, only it's a little different than the one you passed and and and we'll see what they get on the border. would you support an approach like that if it got the money to Ukraine? look, I I think the key thing right now, uh- and we were just talking about this, um, uh, among the Democrats just an hour ago- pass the bill that's already passed the Senate. we have Republicans, we have Democrats who voted for it. Ukraine needs the money now. the, the, the ukrainians are running out of ammunition, literally. they need the help right now. this thing has already been vetted. it's gotten strong support from Republicans in the Senate. there are Republicans in the house who want to do it. there are Democrats in the house want to do it. the path is there. all you have to do is just take it. come on, leader Johnson, make it happen. well, of course, it's not just aid for Ukraine in question, it's aid for Israel as well. you have previously said the US should be conditioning Aid to Israel to protect civilian life in Palestine, and that is very much a topic of discussion in Michigan right now, where there is a primary underway and an effort for voters to back uncommitted rather than President Biden because of his policy and supporting Israel, despite what we're seeing happen in Gaza. does the president deserve to lose those votes? uh, the president is doing um. uh, he is working hard and the president deserves our support. he has earned it and he has earned it across the board. I want to be clear, though, when we're talking about what's happening right now in Israel, that the Netanyahu government, in response to terrorist attacks, the fact that there are still hostages that are held, the Netanyahu government has created a humanitarian disaster, and it's a disaster that gets worse every single day. um, in addition to that, the Netanyahu government has said no to a long-term peace solution, that is, a two-state solution, which is the official policy of the United States of America and the one way that we can make certain that two states for two peoples who are able to live in dignity, in security and with selfdetermination. um, we know what we need to do right now. we need to get those hostages back, we need to cease fire in place, we need to open up that humanitarian relief big time and we need to be pushing both parties toward a two-state solution where everyone in the region can live in dignity, security and self-determination. the economy is, of course, a big part of Joe Biden's pitch in Michigan and all over the country right now, because the data are undeniable: the strength of this economy, despite the debate that seems to be uh being had around whether we're going to have a recession or not. but it's interesting: the the more the FED hikes interest rates, it it seems, the stronger this job market gets. somehow- and I I recall some pretty tough conversations you had with Jay Powell in in Senate hearings where you called him a dangerous man because the idea was that this job market might not survive such intense rate hikes. do you feel differently now? not, not only might not remember that the fed put out a report a year ago, this past December, that said they were targeting, uh, watching the unemployment rate go up. they were going to keep raising interest rates until more people- millions of people- were unemployed now turned out, they raised those interest rates and that didn't happen. and it's the reminder. the FED has basically one tool on inflation, right it. it raises interest rates. that works for some kinds of inflation problems. but this was a time when prices shot up, in part because we were coming out of covid, we had supply chain kinks, in part because the war in Ukraine had disrupted both food and energy supplies, and in part- and it's still happening- because in concentrated Industries we've watched, uh, big increases in profit margins as companies have engaged in price gouging. the FED can't touch any of those and in fact I've asked Jerome pal about this in hearings and he's admitted no, they can't do anything about it. right now. those High interest rates are actually increasing cost for families, because one of the big parts of cost for families is housing and with interest rates High we know it's more expensive to buy a home. we also know it's more expensive to finance an apartment building or Finance any new housing construction, and all of that gets passed on to Consumers. it's time to get those interest rates down. so you would like to see the FED start cutting rates as soon as the next meeting. yes, despite what may happen to the fight against inflation as a result. well, you know, they're off supposedly, um, fighting inflation. they are not fighting some, not all, of the principal causes of inflation. and besides, let's keep in mind, uh, six out of the last seven months inflation has been at 2% or lower. we've watched the numbers. they're in a pretty good place, um, and what matters, I think, is that we pay attention to how families are experiencing this economy. the fed's job is not just a bunch of papers and numbers on a a sheet cheet of paper. it's about how families are living this economy and keeping families so stressed on housing not good for our country. of course, here at Bloomberg, we talk a lot about the Federal Reserve. we also talk a lot about deals, as we have seen a lot of news within the last week: the FTC yesterday filing suit to block the merger between Kroger and Albertson. of course, within the last week and changed. we've had news of the Capital One discover Financial merger, both of which I know you are against on anti-competitive grounds. but what these companies are arue is that is how they're able to compete against a Visa or a Mastercard or an Amazon or a Walmart. is it not anti-competitive to not allow consolidation to compete with the largest players that are out there? so let me just start with. this is not the first time we've heard this argument. uh, this argument has been used, um, pretty much since the beginning of time in antit trust law. oh, please, just let me get bigger so I can compete with the other Giants, but let's unpack these just a little bit. so, for example, in the case of, uh, the Kroger Albert since merger, we've now, in earlier lawsuits that have been brought and now information is coming out through Discovery, we see that those, those two Giants, have been communicating with each other about how to keep wages down for grocery workers at both stores. um, potentially a violation of the law, but it tells us what they want. this agement, yeah, these are the no poach agreements, right, which? just a way to say I'm paying these folks $7.50 an hour, $11.50 an hour, and I don't have to worry. they're going to get hired away for $12 or12, half doar, right, I don't have to worry about that. this is another way to say that this is how the Giants see their way to improve profits. do they improve profits by offering better service? do they improve profits by lowering costs? no, that's not where they're going. they're looking at ways to reduce competition and I gotta say right now, particularly in the grocery business, where we've actually seen margins increase dramatically, but for the individual items you buy and at the stores, this is not a time for the FTC to say: sure, go ahead and merge. let's just have one grocery store in each of these areas, setting prices and setting wages wherever they want to set them bad idea. there's another issue you're very passionate about in addition to to antitrust, and that is crypto. you have, in just the last week, gotten a new Challenger for your senate seat in Massachusetts, John Deon, a proc crypto attorney. there is tens of millions of dollars in crypto backpacks that could be weaponized against you in this election cycle, as the industry sees that you are pushing legislation in your anti-money laundering legislation that would essentially apply the bank secrecy act, kyc, uh, restrictions to this industry- that that is something that could completely wipe it out in the United States. clearly, this relationship is antagonistic. why not try to collaborate with the industry to fix the issues? I want to collaborate with the industry. what I don't understand is why the industry seems to be saying that the only way that they can survive is if there's plenty of space for the drug traffickers and human traffickers. oh, and the terrorists and the ransomware scammers and the consumer scammers and the Rogue nations. North Korea that is financing about half of its nuclear missile program with crypto- that all of that has to be left open. you know, keep in mind, in our financial system, pretty much everybody follows the same set of rules. I'm talking Banks and credit unions and credit card companies- uh. gold Traders and stock Brokers- uh. private Equity now has to follow the rules. precious metal dealers, venmo, Western Union, but not crypto. my view of the world is: same kind of activity, same kind of risk should have the same regulation. I'm not looking for fancier regulation for them. I'm not looking for for anything tougher for them. I just want a Level Playing Field here where, if you're part of the financial system moving around literally billions of dollars, that remember, my bill is not a regulatory bill. it's a. it's a bill about law enforcement, that law enforcement has the same tools that it has anywhere else to be able to shut down the terrorists and the drug traffickers and the scammers. I think that's the right thing and I welcome anybody who wants to come in and make that happen. and, frankly, I don't understand a defense that says no, no, we, we got to make sure that there is a place for those guys to play without getting caught.",[217]
232,FyRU1srvw4g,"Campari CEO on 2024 Outlook, M&A, Prices",Bloomberg Television,2024-02-28 12:23:43+00:00,"Let's talk a little bit about how you see the rest of this year. The numbers have gone down really well. The only thing that I'm hearing is that your guidance is a little bit vague for 2024.. Is that deliberate, And if so, why? Well, look, I mean we've registered three consecutive years of double digit growth of the top line and the bottom line and we've way outperformed our reference markets, taking market share across the board. Now, if you look at the market last year, it was pretty subdued because, coming off the revenge, conviviality, post-pandemic consumption, normalized stocks went down across markets. But we we actually did very, very well across all of our key brand market combinations. Now, if you look at it this year, I mean we are pretty confident about the momentum of our brands. Having said that, you know it's there are a lot of different moving parts, particularly on the COGS side. So you know we just wanted to have a few months under our belt before we expressed anything. Would you say? would you say the risk is to the upside? You're being cautious. It sounds like you're waiting to see what is happening here. Is your expectation that actually it's going to be another good year? Would that be your kind of base case? I know you're not going to give me details, but, but are you feeling positive? Well, as I said earlier, I mean, the most important thing is that our brands are very, very healthy and that we have a very healthy topline and continue taking market share. Okay, So that's the outlook in terms of the well, that's the outlook for this year. Bob, good morning. Thank you very much for joining us. Can I ask you about M&A? You've clearly done quite a bit of M&A as you've reshaped this business, And we know that Courvoisier is the most recent acquisition which separates which geographies. are you still interested in building up through M&A, Bob? Yeah, I mean, I mean, M&A has been great. You know, in my tenure we've done 27 deals, over â‚¬4 billion and, as you said, totally change the company. Now we've got three, actually four- with cognac- very serious legs- Tequila, bourbon, Aperitifs, And now cognac is coming. We would continue looking forward to, you know, premium aged dark spirits, ideally whiskies, with a great skew to the US and to Asia. Yeah, tell me about that SKU, because it seems that with the Courvoisier purchase, you're increasing your exposure to the United States- You talked about there wanting more exposure to the US- and then again in Asia, both of these economies having strengths and weaknesses. What is it about those, those markets that you want a piece of at this point, Bob? Well, there are two things. I mean the US has the largest pool profit pool in our industry and although it is our largest market, we still have a lot of opportunity to grow in that great, highly profitable market. On the other side, Asia, is actually our smallest region. It's only 8% of sales And clearly, you know there is great growth from a demographics standpoint, from consumers, premium sizing moving to imported spirits, and we'd like to have our piece of that. Barber Kriti Gupta in London. thank you again for joining us. Let's talk about the tour around the world that we started with the US Asia. Let's bring it back to Europe. here You have a 20 percentage point margin difference between northern Europe and southern Europe. There's talk about merging the two. Why do that? Can you walk us through the logic? Do you expect the kind of really strong Northern Europe margins to seep in to southern Europe? Well, well, actually, I mean, there is no difference in marginality between northern and European in sovereign Europe. The difference is that the way we report the headquarter costs get input into sovereign Europe. So you know, let's put that aside- We're very profitable in both north and south in Europe. The logic and putting them together is really about having commercial and marketing synergies. Let me give you, for example, the idea, clearly in the summertime, for the idea that we'd like to leverage all of the Mediterranean coastline and the islands to activate our brands and recruit new consumers. Now, you know, in the past it was the sovereign European markets overinvesting in debt and the northern European markets getting the benefit, and clearly, merging them together takes away any of that disparity and creates a lot more harmony, a lot more focus to do the right things for the bigger whole. But, Bob, how does that affect pricing then? Are you concerned at all about some sort of upper bound in terms of appetite for actually paying for some of these products, even, especially in southern Europe, going into the holiday season? Look, we've taken robust pricing in the past two years. We've taken about 15% and we've repositioned key brands such as Campari and Aperol. I think, going forward we will- as we, you know, declared it yesterday- come down to more, I think, numbers reflecting inflation in 1 to 2%. And you know, consumers are willing to pay for quality And we see that. you know, despite the price increases we've grown double digit across the board. Well, can we talk a little bit about after all? I'm asking this question for a friend, mainly my wife. I was in Italy last week, week before last. You can buy their premixed Apple. Apple has had a pretty good year. What was it up 23% year on year. What else can you get out of the Apple brand? Is is the premium? How is the premix going? Is that something that you can roll out elsewhere? How do you evolve this brand, or at least develop this brand to give you a bigger punch coming off it? Well, look, you know, we bought Aperol 20 years ago and every year it's grown double digit. And I keep on repeating that we're only at the beginning of the Aperol story and that the orange wave will turn into a tsunami pretty soon. You know our aperol, with the Aperol spritz, sources three quarters of its volumes from beer. If we take the most highly penetrated market, which is Italy, Yeah, our per capita consumption of Aperol spritz in Italy is only 1.2% of that of beer. Now, if we set Italy at index 100, the next market only has 45% of the penetration of Italy. If we look at the largest opportunity, the US. the US only has 4% of the penetration of Italy, And I'm not even talking about what we can do in Asia and in South America and many other countries. So we're really at the very beginning of the story and we focus on one drink only, the Aperol spritz and the perfect serve, And that is working. I mean 20 years, the underlying growing 23% across- Yeah, double digit growth across all markets. I'll buy that any time. Bob, if we're on a jump, say that these two are not convinced about the apple spritz, Just going to put it out there. I don't know. There's some education that needs to happen here. Well, it sounds like bold things is a great growth opportunity. So, Chris, you know, maybe we'll have to go and rethink and just wait for your marketing to try and get you Campari spreads again, Maybe. Let me just ask you about marketing Spend. last year in Europe, The weather meant that I think you had to pull some of your marketing. It just wasn't. the right time was to halt. What can we expect from marketing spend this year? Look our in, our marketing spend will normalize. It will be between where we've always been and where we were last year as a percentage of sales. Clearly, we're a very agile company and we'll be able to adapt according to the opportunities. I mean we will seize every opportunity we have because we know that as soon as we activate our brands, create our events, put liquid on lips, there's a great return to that.",[207]
233,qTTuvqV2SrU,"SLB CEO on Economy, Industry M&A, Saudi Aramco",Bloomberg Television,2024-03-05 21:07:39+00:00,"I want to start with the economic data we got today. ISM services in the US. It was okay. It's maybe a little bit soft on the headline. What's your read on the global economy and the US economy? I think the global economy, considering the number of conflict and uncertainty on China, is actually doing okay And I think that when you turn it into demand for energy, I think that the amount of energy still going- the oil in particular, liquid demand, I think- has been cooking fairly well to the GDP growth for the last 40 years And I believe this is still happening. So the US economy: I believe that there was a lot of fear of recession- Mm, hmm, But the fear of missing soft landing. I believe that what we see today happening on many indicators in the US prove that this economy has a lot of resilience and would certainly have a nice soft landing that will keep the economy growing and success All right. So maybe a pretty solid economy like steady as she goes, steady as she goes- has been M&A in the oil space here in the US. Does M&A here for oil guys mean less business for you or less pricing power going forward? No, I think it is not a surprise that this industry is consolidating. I think the consolidation brings scale, efficiency and access to Taiwan resource that are in scale access. So I believe that for us, the bigger the better, as we call it. we're doing typically better with a larger customer that have a a larger portfolio of acreage and solution we can provide. So typically we provide more recovery or pressure on performance And, during this transition, more digital services. as company wants to excite synergy, want to excite the effect of scale and wants to prove that they can gain efficiency by using the best technology they have both companies are using. So we try to be successful to file technology and forces globally positive. So one plus one doesn't equal less than two. One plus one equals it. It will. it will on occasion, Okay, Because there will be consolidation of activity. that will high grade- The Buffalo high grade- also set. But as an intensity of technology and what is left? the intensity of technology, the mission is going higher and we typically are doing well and we anticipate to do well and to perform in the US. So, based on that, I know that shale is like infinitesimal part maybe of your business, but I do want to get your take on. do I'm going to see another surprise performance from US shale production this year, like we did last year, I think Will I'll be surprised that we have a repeat to the same scale. However, I think we should note the scale that the progress we are seeing in the efficiency, in performance of technology- and we are part of it. We provide performance breakthrough to our customers on well construction of aspects and customer benefit and do it faster with better wells and complete and lift their oil pollution in a better way. Not now Typically mid stress, the geology that are constrained and hence the the. the trend that we are seeing in M&A that is trying to make the best out of existing resources and combine with first is on a small, I think the North America to Europe was on 20% of our total business. We still have a very large ft4 base in presence in the US and we we are very successful with our technology in the US inventories. But compared to your offshore I mean, you're a real giant in the offshore landscape. What is your confidence in the offshore recovery that we see in like? how long is your visibility into that sustainability, as we keep referring to this? second, as characteristics of breath, residents and duration. Hmm, I think the offshore attributes that plays the most is duration. We believe that by definition, offshore is long cycle path to the independent, Hmm. Secondly, there has been a resurgence of some exploration offshore, not only in an existing base, in in infrastructure led exploration, as we call it, but also into New Frontier. So this is adding a pipeline of RFID that will prolong the cycle beyond what we can see today. So today, if you look at the numbers, we anticipate that the global offshore will see about $100 billion of f80 there each 24 and 25 the next, this year, next year, as a size of f80, that that in the pipeline in shallow, all departing Ireland. and this we believe will be extended beyond because there is a quite a large activity on exploration and appraisal in some province, in a new province, like Namibia, like Surinam, like the coastal margin in Brazil. When you say extended, extended meaning like 20.. 22,, 2028, 29.. Much later into this decade that we could have anticipated maybe two or three years ago. And, of course, EV ideas, final investment decision, When people start to really like companies really put money to work. One company or country that's putting less money to work Maybe it's Saudi, Saudi Aramco, Saudi Arabia and Saudi Aramco not going to develop 30 million barrels of oil a day, You shrug because it wasn't a big deal, Right? But when you look at your share price, the stock fell 7% and it hasn't truly recovered since that day. What are people getting wrong about the scenario? I think we have been very clear on the market on the consequence of this decision. The consequence decision for us is immaterial. you know potential to continue to grow immediately smithereens. It is at the record high level of investment, combined with the old capacity expansion in Saudi, but in other over country- UAE, Kuwait, and the rubbing off of Iraq or Libya, further expansion. Secondly, in the entire Middle East region, gas is becoming a critical cottage priority and more conventional gas like cattle is developing for energy export or international and commercial and gas for for local consumption or for replacement of oil or in production. So if Saudi Aramco stays conservative, like does it start to bite in? like 2025, 2026?? No, I don't think they are conservative. I was there for a week three weeks ago and the activity is as high as we have ever been and I've ever seen in the Middle East and parts growing in Saudi. It's such, it's very, very strong And it's a record high land activity, record high offshore activity. This expansion that was supposed to happen is at the moment suspended, delayed, could come back that it could provide an over 1 million buy In addition from offshore. We happen to be very well exposed and they long on onshore exposure because of our integrated contact contract. We happen to also extremely well exposed to gas in Saudi. So for us is minimum or immaterial impact for this year for sure, and for the foreseeable future. We see growth this year, very significant growth in all or almost all the country. Middle East wants to build this activity momentum to continue into next year. And this change of of to project that have been postponed, that has been cancelled, that you know happens on more than 1% of the total upstream spend per year- is not changing. Our strategy is not changing. The game is not changing what is the largest and biggest investment cycle Middle East And that is very good perspective to keep in that when we hear these headlines that they cross. So just to wrap up, Speaking of Saudi Arabia, we just saw Opec+ continue the extension of their cuts Is 80 a floor, a top like: how do you see the oil market? Where's the band? The band has been- I think opaque, has been willing to to set the floor up 80 or more. The oil price have stayed between 7585, well spread to this market to stay to stay a stretch And because of that we will continue to use opec+, continue to use their opportunity to adjust to the market, to the market demand supply equation. As you can see, the maturity of the US market starting to go towards production plateau, We create more pull on international liquid demand and gas activity internationally continue to expand due to gas security. So this combination will continue to push and support activity outlook and I'm not willing to predict- we will not predict on price, but we believe that the the balance of opec+, the continued pull on international supply that will stretch the existing resource basins internationally, will continue to support very healthy oil prices going forward.","[110, 207]"
234,ezvnji9xHZk,A Trump vs. Biden Rematch: What's Different in 2024? | WSJ,The Wall Street Journal,2024-03-06 14:33:37+00:00,"- [Narrator] The expected rematch between President Biden and former President Donald Trump is happening - We're effectively in a general election now. that's just unprecedented in a lot of ways. There're just so many unknowns. - [Narrator] While Biden faces obstacles like concerns about his age and declining approval ratings, Trump is juggling a set of challenges that no presidential candidates have ever confronted. Here's a look at those challenges and how Trump will try to turn them into opportunities. The 2024 election is gearing up to be a face-off between the oldest nominees in history, and it's going to be the first presidential rematch in the US since 1956, when President Dwight Eisenhower faced and defeated Adlai Stevenson for the second time. - [Reporter] The result was never in doubt: It was a landslide for the Eisenhower-Nixon ticket. - We know from polling, and just you know talking to voters around the country, that people are really kind of weary about the notion of a Trump-Biden matchup. but that's what we're gonna have. It's gonna be all consuming, I think, for the American public. - [Narrator] The race is now an endurance challenge for both candidates. after Trump easily beat out his Republican rivals, including Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley - Donald Trump's strength really shows how much of a hold he has on the party's base, the core voters. They are willing to swing with his different positions on issues that aren't always aligned with a certain feeling that's been long baked into the Republican party. - [Supporters]: Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump. - He didn't dabble much or tangle much with his rivals. Trump never got on the debate stage with his rivals. He felt he didn't have to. Why should he? We don't know his positions, for example, on some of the key foreign policy matters, like the war in the Middle East, So it's sort of kept him out of the scrutiny of you know political discourse. So it worked out well for him. - [Narrator]. Trump's 2024 started off pretty busy, from campaign events to court hearings. - I'm gonna have to sit here for months on a trial. - [Narrator]. And sometimes those two things lined up on back-to-back days in very different locations. On February 14th, Trump spoke at a campaign rally in North Charleston, South Carolina. - Well, thank you very much, South Carolina, and happy Valentine's Day everybody. - [Narrator]. The next day he was in New York for a hearing over his alleged role in a scheme to pay hush money to a porn star. - I'll be here during the day and I'll be campaigning during the night. - Trump has tried, and has had some success so far, marrying the two. Essentially, the campaign and the courtroom are the same. We've seen him when he goes to court, often speaking to reporters making sure his voice is heard - It's election interference at the highest level. It's a disgrace - And kind of plowing head with his message that this is all designed to stop him politically -. I stand before you today not only as your past and hopefully future president, but as a proud political dissident. - That is gonna be more difficult, of course, as these cases really take hold. That's gonna start to really eat into his ability to be out there on the campaign trail. - [Narrator]. The legal trials have also drained his political coffers. In 2023,, Trump's campaign spent roughly $50 million on legal fees and between two New York civil lawsuits, plus interest. the former president was ordered to shell out more than half a billion dollars in financial penalties. - The spending for Trump on legal fees is a real open question: whether he can sustain the amount of money that he is devoting towards these cases, his lawyers and defending himself. He does have the ability to raise a lot of money Every time he's going to court. every time he leaves court, they fire off a campaign email asking for more money, saying that it's not just himself that's being persecuted, but his supporters. He's very good at personalizing what he's undergoing with his own supporters, and a lot of people feel that way, and they give more money. - [Narrator]. While Trump has performed well in the GOP primaries, some warning signs indicate that voter enthusiasm for his return to the White House appears to be waning. In early state elections in Iowa and New Hampshire, nearly half of primary voters didn't vote for Trump, And when asked how they would feel if he became the nominee, many of the non-Trump voters in New Hampshire said they'd be so dissatisfied that they wouldn't vote for him in the general election. - Trump can't afford to lose too many Republican voters. He's trying to pull voters back into his fold and new voters by promising effectively a return to relative economic prosperity. that marked his first term until COVID. The downside is that the economy is improving in a lot of ways. for Joe Biden, We're gonna see a lot of battles over who can sustain this growth that we're seeing. - [Narrator] Biden, as the sitting president, whose approval ratings continue to drop, has his own challenges ahead. One of Biden's most striking vulnerabilities has come under intense scrutiny after a special counsel report investigating his mishandling of classified documents made several strong claims about his memory. - Something the special counsel said in his report is that one of the reasons you were not charged is because, in his description, ""You are a well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory"". - I'm well-meaning and I'm an elderly man and I know what the hell I'm doing. I've been president and I put this country back on his feet. - Age and mental acuity is one of the big issues facing Joe Biden and his attempts to win a second term. We see it poll after poll that Americans, Democrats, Republicans, independents, think he's too old. It's why we've seen such an aggressive attempt by the White House and Democrats to sort of frame it in different ways. - I'm absolutely confident, based on his incredible record of success for the country, that he is the right person to lead the country for another four years. - [Narrator]. Age isn't the only concern. More than half of the country thinks Biden's policies during his presidency have hurt more than they've helped. The face-off between Trump and Biden will test the stamina of both candidates and the voters. Polling has shown that a majority of Americans think neither Biden nor Trump should run for president again in 2024.. -. It's gonna be a long, long slog, one that a lot of Americans just don't want to happen, but it's happening. It's gonna be an unprecedented wild ride to the finish here, and we're all gonna be part of it, whether you want to or not. (pensive music).",[207]

237,LtqQ-5FWK-M,Sectors UpClose: A contrarian's view of the UK's damaged REITs market | REUTERS,Reuters,2024-02-29 16:10:23+00:00,"[Music]. welcome to sector up close. I'm Elena Casas. today our topic is UK real estate investment trusts, or REITs, and my guest is Russ mold, investment director at AJ Bell. this sector was once a darling of yield Hungry Investors. now many reats are suffering from the Twin problems of empty offices and high interest rates. the footy 350 Real Estate Investment Trust index is down 10% this year alone. that compares with a 2% decline for the broader 350, which tracks domestically focused companies. according to research provided to us by AJ Bell, it's 27th out of the 39 industry groups that make up the index. so are there any bright spots in this sector Outlook? let's ask AJ Bells, Russ mold. let's start, then, with the macro picture. you mentioned retails, closing down, empty offices, the struggling UK economy and your notes. is there a brighter future here? it's not a desperately pretty picture, is it? but there are some sub sectors that are continuing to thrive. segro, which is a footz 100 companies, just raised 900 million pound from its investors through an issue very quickly, very easily, and it's a major warehousing Logistics player, for example. so there are areas that are very strong. but you're right, there's a lot of shares that have struggled for a very long time, certainly since the pandemic because of the rise of working from home, the ongoing battle that bricks and motar retailers have got and, yes, eventually the UK has tipped into that long awaited recession. Bank of England's continuing to say don't worry, don't worry, it'll be a shallow one. but investors understandably now worried about Rising voids or vacancies and whether there'll be any pressure on rents, just when you're seeing some REITs, even office REITs, showing increase activity in new lettings because they got some brand spanking new buildings to let out which at the moment it seems tenants are quite Keen to move into. historically, this, of course, was a yield play. at the moment the index is 4.79%. yield doesn't compare very well with 2-year guilts at 4.3%. so are investors needing to wait for the bank of England before thinking about this as a serious investment? I think it's. I think that's a major, major development that would be very, very helpful for the sector. if you look during that 10 or 12 year period of 0.5% interest rates we had in the UK, the sector did incredibly well. investors were falling over themselves for almost any source of yield and property was very much one of those real estates in the Vanguard. they have to pay out 90% of their income as dividends to maintain their taxfree preferential status. so they were a big yield player and you're right. if you can get 4.1% from 10-year guilts, more than that from 2-year, in theory risk-free- and I stress in theory- or even cash in the bank- the bank of England's base rate is 5 and a quarter perc- real estates just don't look quite so attractive. so lower Bas rates, lower bond yields, might bring these stocks back into play. since they're so un Love Now, does that mean they're undervalued? well, somebody who's a natur is a yorman, therefore natural PID up. member of the awkward Squad. I'm always trying to think about what the Market's missing, and very few people are asking about REITs right now, which is quite tempting. thinking back to the post brexit vote in period in 2016, 17 lots of these companies were trading at 25 to 35% discounts- the net asset value- and then saw very strongly as the economy didn't drop into a hole after, after the referendum. I'm not saying that the economy is as strong now as it was then, but the discounts are even bigger to nav in some cases, like at Dent, London or British land or land Securities. so that is interesting again, if you, eony doesn't prove to be as bad as people fear, and indeed you get something of a move back to the office, which we're seeing signs of, and you get those rate Cuts, so the valuations are pricing in an awful lot of bad news. we clearly need to pick and choose here, though, in terms of the types of real estate that these companies hold. you mentioned Logistics and warehouses as a strong point, of course, after the Boom in online shopping, where else are there bright spots? well, student housing is a big one. unite actually trades at a small premium to net asset value, so that trades at 5% premium. then the biggest discounts you got are down at 50% with hamerson, a pure retail play. so there's a very, very widespread, generally speaking, and there are always exceptions. student housing, warehousing, specialist, like data centers, trade very close to nav or much closer healthc care somewhere in the middle. big offices, skyscrapers, big London, uh, property developments and Retail- much bigger discounts. the Outlook, though, for those big London Property Owners is quite varied depending on the company, though, isn't it? it is, I mean again, do at London is trading on about a 35- 38% discount to nav shafts capital a little bit bigger land Securities in the 30s, but they are again, they're not identical companies. they have different mixes in terms of their client base. der with London burb is one of its big Expedia, a big customers. the the UK government is a tenant and even there you got people going back to the office somewhat under duress perhaps. so again, voids are coming down in most of those businesses. if they can now sustainably prove that voids are coming down, the rents are coming in and it's the rents that pay the dividends, not asset valuations. that is something that may make people at least think about reassessing their bearish view of the situation. Russ M of AJ Bell, thanks so much for that contrarian look at UK real estate investment trusts and that's your Roundup of that sector. I'm Elena Casas and this is [Music] Reuters.",[207]

Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment on its latest moves, but they add to a fierce contest with local firms, including byd, which has dethroned its us rival as the biggest maker of EVS. on Friday, it, too, offered new discounts, cutting the starting price of one model by over 15%. in February, it had responded to Tesla's moves with even bigger price cuts of its own. Tesla sparked the price War last year in a bid to grab market share amid signs of softening demand for EVS. it has since done discounts around the world, forcing other automakers to respond.

245,GEbq-sL6bas,'A deep-sea fishing expedition': AOC slams GOP-lead Hunter Biden deposition,CNN,2024-02-28 17:59:00+00:00,"pivotal moment. up on Capitol Hill, as Hunter Biden faces off with Republicans behind closed doors, They're questioning the president's son as part of their impeachment inquiry into his father. After months and months of tense negotiations and some key concessions, Let's go to CNN's chief legal affairs correspondent, Paula. She's up on Capitol Hill for us, Paula. so what's the latest? What are you hearing? Well, Wolf Hunter has been in the room for a little over an hour now and he did not answer questions as he headed into this closed door deposition. But we do have a copy of the opening statement that he was going to give to lawmakers to lay out what he hopes to achieve today. He said in part: I am here today to provide the committees with the one uncounted fact that should end the false premise of this inquiry: I did not involve my father in my business, Not while I was a practicing lawyer, Not in my investments or transaction as domestic or international, Not even as a board member And not as an artist. Never, He goes on to say. For more than a year, your committees have hunted me in your partizan political pursuit of my dad. You have trafficked in innuendo, distortion and sensationalism, all the while ignoring the clear and convincing evidence staring you in the face, that you do not have evidence to support the baseless and MAGA motivated conspiracies about my father, because there isn't any. Now we know that Hunter along with his lawyers, Abbe Lowell and Kevin Morris. they have taken a much more aggressive approach to Republicans, to his detractors, So I think some of that is going to come through today. But this is make or break for GOP lawmakers who so far have not provided clear evidence to support the allegation that President Biden benefited from his son's foreign business dealings. And, of course, he's only appearing for this closed door deposition after a few concessions from Republicans, including that this will not be videotaped and the transcript will be released promptly. Those are things we haven't necessarily seen for other witnesses in this investigation. But, Wolf, let's just. let's just give you a sense of just how much interest there is in today's deposition. They had to move to a larger room and we expect a record number of members to participate, But more members means more questions, which means it could be a pretty late night up here on Capitol Hill When we went into today's transcribed interview with Hunter Biden. we had a dozen witnesses who told us that Joe Biden was not involved in any way in Hunter's business, that he did not profit from Hunter's business and that you know, official favors were benefits to Hunter's business, And nothing that we've heard from Hunter Biden has changed that in any way. In fact, he is emphatically, repeatedly underscored to the Republicans that his father was not involved in any way in his businesses, did not profit from his businesses And Hunter neither asked him for any official favors nor received any official favors from Joe Biden. So what we saw, I think, was a rather embarrassing spectacle where the Republicans continued to belabor completely trivial points. They seemed to be obsessively focused on speaker phones and use of speaker phone. I did not know that that was the devil's technology, but apparently it is, And I believe, based on this first hour, that this whole thing really has been a tremendous waste of our legislative time and the people's resources. But I would love to have each of my colleagues come up and share their sense of what we just witnessed, And we'll start with the vice ranking member, the Oversight committee, Then we'll get to that, Thank you. Thank you so much, Ranking Member Raskin. And I think the ranking member stated it completely: What we just witnessed over the last hour was, I think, a deep sea fishing expedition, because the Republican case has completely fallen apart over the last several weeks And after it's been exposed that that the critical, you know, one of their most key pieces of information was based on a source that was in communication with Russian intelligence, They are now trying to scramble to find anything to substantiate their fairy tale is what we should call this, But I think, more disturbingly, what we are seeing is is just a complete and inappropriate expedition into the president's son and former matters and subjects that are completely unrelated to an impeachment investigation, And I think it is extremely disturbing to see the lack of professionalism, the lack of grounding and the abuse of public resources and abuse of public power in order to pursue something that truly at whose point at this juncture is very unclear. And with that, Mr Swoboda, Judiciary Committee, Thank you. They've got nothing. That's what we just witnessed for the last hour. One of their witnesses has been indicted for working with Russian intelligence. Another witness has been indicted for working with Chinese intelligence. Another witness is serving a 14 year felony sentence. This is fourth and 20 on their own time. and they don't have Patrick Mahomes. You're going to see the greatest sack ever When you get the transcript from this. But what's really embarrassing- and I use the word secondhand embarrassment, because that's what we witnessed in there- is they're so desperate to humiliate the president that they started asking the president's son personal details about a divorce that happened almost ten years ago. That's where this has been reduced to. And they're doing all this, by the way, when we're just days away from the government shutting down. We're critically, critically in need of funding for Ukraine, The humanitarian crisis over in the Middle East, and more security and a broader immigration plan in this country. The wasting time squandered, an opportunity to do that because they've never accepted Joe Biden as the president, And now, in this last Hail Mary effort, they're going to try and pull off something I promise you. Past is Prolog. It's not going to work. All right, Let's go back to the oversight side there, Dan Goldman. Sure, I'll be brief. I want to be very clear. That first hour of this much anticipated testimony was the nail in the coffin to what is a complete bogus and sham impeachment inquiry. Not only did they, were they unable to show any connection between Hunter Biden's business and President Biden, but Hunter Biden gave very detailed and clear explanations as to what his arm's length business transactions were with private parties in foreign countries who are investors and business people. like many people would have, He went through a laundry list of board seats and jobs that he has had over his 30 year career after he left Yale Law School and he withstood some in a appropriate attacks even in the first hour. So it is not simply there's no connection to the president, which we've known all along and which was made clear again, But there is a very understandable, coherent business explanation for every single thing that they asked for.",[207]

SUGGESTING REPEATEDLY THAT DONALD TRUMP CANNOT WIN NOVEMBER AND THIS IS A TESTAMENT IN EVIDENCE OF THAT. WE >> NIKKI HALEY TO MOVE FORWARD IN THIS PROCESS BUT THE CONCERN FOR REPUBLICANS IS,  NOT ONLY IS SHE CHIPPING AWAY INDEPENDENCE BUT ALSO, CONSERVATIVES WHO VOTED FOR JOE BIDEN IN 2020.

FORMER PRESIDENT BIDEN DID NOT WIN IT WHAT WHAT DO YOU THINK IT SAYS ABOUT THE FACT THAT THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT MEMBER, THIS IS KIND OF A PROTEST GRASSROOTS EFFORT. >> WRIGHT, SAVANNAH. THIS IS A CONVERSATION HAPPENING ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE. THE QUESTION IS, HOW MANY FOLKS WILL COME OUT AND SELECT UNCOMMITTED INSTEAD OF JOE BIDEN? MORE THAN 100,000 COME OUT AND DO JUST THAT. MICHIGAN WITH THE MAJOR AMERICAN POPULATION WHO HAS EXPRESSED OUTRAGE ABOUT THE BIDEN'S ADMINISTRATION'S HANDLING OF THE WAR IN GAZA AND YET, WE SAW JOE BIDEN PERFORM WELL. I THINK IMPORTANT CONTEXT IS BACK IN 2012 WHEN BARACK OBAMA WAS RUNNING UNCONTESTED. 11% ALSO SELECTED UNCOMMITTED. 14% IS NOT THAT MUCH DIFFERENCE WHEN YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT A MAJOR SWING STATES LIKE MICHIGAN, EVERY VOTE COUNTS AND WE ARE TALKING ABOUT $100,000 SELECTING UNCOMMITTED. >> WE HAVE SUPER TUESDAY NEXT WEEK.

SENATORS FROM BOTH PARTIES SAY THEY WILL LIKELY PASS ANOTHER SHORT-TERM FUNDING BILL TO PREVENT A FUNDING BILL TO PREVENT A SHUTDOWN, THIS WEEKEND. >>> WE ARE ALL ONCE AGAIN STARING DOWN THE BARREL OF A POSSIBLE SHUTDOWN SET TO TAKE LACE THIS FRIDAY. IT IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN THE SHUTDOWNS WE HAVE DEALT WITH IN THE PAST AND THAT THIS WOULD ONLY BE A PARTIAL SHUTDOWN. ABOUT ONE THIRD OF THE GOVERNMENT IMPACTING VETERANS AFFAIRS ON THE TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT BUT A WEEK LATER, THERE WOULD BE THE POSSIBILITY OF THE ENTIRE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHUTTING DOWN. LAWMAKERS MET AT THE WHITE HOUSE, YESTERDAY. THIS WAS THE TOP CONGRESSIONAL LEADER, THE MINORITY LEADER AND THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE. WHILE THEY DID TALK ABOUT THE SHUTDOWN, A LOT OF THE FOCUS OF THEIR DISCUSSION WAS AROUND THAT AID PACKAGE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE AID TO UKRAINE AND ISRAEL. BOTH SIDES HAVE SAID THEY DO NOT WANT A SHUTDOWN AND WILL DO EVERYTHING THEY POSSIBLY CAN TO AVOID A SHUTDOWN AND THAT ENTERS INTO THE REAL POSSIBILITY THAT THEY WILL PASS SOME SORT OF A SHORT-TERM SPENDING BILL TO ALLOW THE TALKS TO CONTINUE PAST THE DEADLINE. THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE FLOATING THE DATES OF MARCH 8 AND MARCH 22nd AS PART OF THAT TWO-TIERED PLAN TO FUND THE GOVERNMENT. AN OPEN QUESTION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN, LAWMAKERS WILL RETURN TO WASHINGTON, TODAY. THIS AND IT HAS ALREADY BEEN IN SESSION AND THE HOUSE WILL RETURN, TODAY.

IT WL BE A VERY BUSY COUPLE OF DAYS ON CAPITOL HILL. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH. THAT IS WHY I MENTIONED HUNTER BIDEN IS SET TO TESTIFY TODAY IN A CLOSED DOOR DEPOSITION. >> THE DEPOSITION COMES AFTER THE LEGAL TEAM INITIALLY REFUSED HOUSE REPUBLICANS SUBPOENA FOR A PRIVATE DEPOSITION. SAYING THAT HE WOULD ONLY TESTIFY IN PUBLIC SO HIS WORDS COULD NOT BE MANIPULATED. YOU MIGHT REMEMBER, IN JANUARY, HUNTER AND HIS ATTORNEY MADE A SURPRISING APPEARANCE SITTING IN THE AUDIENCE AT THE HOUSE COMMITTEE TO VOTE. THE COMMITTEE DELAYED THAT VOTE BEFORE ULTIMATELY ABANDONING I . SO HOW DID HE FINALLY END UP HERE? >> LET'S BRING IN SARA FITZPATRICK WHO WILL HELP US SORT IT ALL OUT. TODAY'S DEPOSITION, IT IS REALLY OVER A YEAR IN THE MAKING. HOW DID THE HOUSE AND HUNTER BIDEN FINALLY REACH A DEAL AFTER ALL OF THIS DRAMA WE HAVE SEEN PLAY OUT AND HAVE HIM TESTIFY BEHIND CLOSED DOORS? >> YOU'RE RIGHT, IT HAS BEEN A VERY LONG ROAD WITH THE STAKES BECAME WAY TOO HIGH. OR HOUSE REPUBLICANS, THEY HAVE MADE HUGE ALLEGATIONS. THEY HAVE SPENT SO MUCH TIME AND SO MANY RESOURCES AND THEY ARE FACING WITTICISM INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY THAT THEY HAVE NOT PRODUCED CLEAR EVIDENCE OF A CRIME. HUNTER PLACES -- FACES SEVERAL CHARGES. TAXES AND POSSESSION OF A GUN. BEING HELD IN CONTEMPT OF CONGRESS IS JUST TOO RISKY. TODAY'S DEPOSITION COMES AFTER A STRING OF SOME MAJOR STEP BACK FOR REPUBLICANS PUSHING FOR THIS INCREASE. LASTLY, THAT FORMER FBI PUBLIC -- INFORMANT WAS ARRESTED AND ACCUSED OF MAKING UP A LOT OF THE STORIES THAT HE HAD SHARED ABOUT THE BIDEN FAMILY. HE HAS PLED NOT GUILTY BUT TELL US WHAT CAN WE >> TODAY AND WHAT THE REPUBLICANS HOPE TO GET OUT OF HUNTER BIDEN ? >> WE ARE GOING TO SEE AND HEAR AND THEY WILL NOT GET THE TRANSCRIPT FOR SEVERAL DAYS BUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THIS CLOSED DOOR DEPOSITION WILL BE HUNTER BIDEN PUSHING BACK, TALKING DIRECTLY TO THOSE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS FOR THE FIRST TIME ABOUT THE ALLEGATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING HIM FOR YEARS. HE WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT HE MADE >> Reporter: MISTAKES AND HE WILL TALK ABOUT HIS ROLE IN ADDICTION AND MAKING MISTAKES BUT HE IS ALSO CRITICAL OF JOE BIDEN HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HIS BUSINESSES AND DID NOT BENEFIT FROM THEM, FINANCIALLY OR OTHERWISE. REPUBLICANS WILL FOCUS ON WHAT THEY VIEW AS INCONSISTENCIES IN PRIOR WITNESS STATEMENTS AND DRILL DOWN ON PHRASING AND EMAILS AND OTHER CORRESPONDENCE TO TRY TO GET HUNTER TO ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT THEY VIEW AS HIS SELLING OF INFLUENCE. WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE SUCCESSFUL IN THAT, WE WILL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE. >> HOW MUCH FURTHER DO YOU THINK REPUBLICANS CAN SEEK IMPEACHMENT? >> NOT MUCH. WHILE THERE ARE STILL MORE INVESTIGATIVE STEPS AHEAD AND MORE INTERVIEWS AND SUBPOENAS, THEY ARE AIMING FOR A REPORT ON THE INVESTIGATION TO BE COMPLETE BY THE SPRING BUT WE WILL HAVE TO SEE IF THEY STICK TO THAT TIMELINE. >> JAMES, AND JIM JORDAN SUBPOENA GARRETT GARLAND. WHAT MORE SHOULD WE KNOW ABOUT THAT? >> THIS IS KIND OF AN ESCALATION IN THE BACK-AND FORTH BETWEEN THE HILL AND DOJ. HOUSE REPUBLICANS ARE LOOKING FOR THE UNDERLYING TAPES, THE TAPES OF THE INTERVIEW BETWEEN SPECIAL COUNSEL AND PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN BECAUSE THEY WANT TO SEE IF THOSE MEMORY LAPSES WHICH WERE CITED AS THE KEY REASON WHY THEY CHOSE NOT TO CHARGE THE PRESIDENT. CHARGE THE PRESIDENT.

UP TO 10 INCHES OF SNOW WITH WINDS REACHING 60 MILES AN HOUR. >>> WE ARE CHECKING THE WEATHER ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. GOOD MORNING. >>> IT HAS BEEN A WILD 24 HOURS OF THE WEATHER. WE ARE DEALING WITH THAT SEVERE THREAT. LET'S FOCUS ON THAT BECAUSE WE DO HAVE SOME TORNADO WATCH IS IN EFFECT UNTIL MIDMORNING. THIS LINE CONTINUES MARCHING ACROSS PORTIONS OF THE TENNESSEE AND OHIO VALLEY. THAT IS WHERE WE SEE THE ROBUST THUNDERSTORMS AND PLENTY OF LIGHTNING. ALL OF THESE THUNDERSTORM WARNINGS ARE IN EFFECT ACROSS PORTIONS OF KENTUCKY AND THIS IS SOMETHING WE WILL WATCH THROUGH MIDMORNING, POTENTIALLY, EVEN LATER INTO THE MORNING & EARLY AFTERNOON. WE COULD STILL BE DEALING WITH THESE STRONG STORMS. THIS IS THE SYSTEM THAT IS THE COLD FRONT. IT IS GOING TO BRING KIND OF A MESSY COMMUTE TO FOLKS UP AND DOWN THE I-95 CORRIDOR, ESPECIALLY, INTO THIS EVENING'S COMMUTE. IT WILL BE MOSTLY RAIN, SOME SNOW IN THE INTERIOR AREAS OF THE NORTHEAST AND NEW ENGLAND BUT IT WILL MOSTLY BE THAT HEAVY RAIN. YOU WILL LIKELY SEE THIS IMPACTING FOLKS AS THEY ARE TRYING TO GET HOME, TODAY. THE THREAT FOR SEVERE WEATHER MUCH LOWER IN THE AFTERNOON HOURS TODAY THAN IT WAS YESTERDAY ACROSS PORTIONS OF THE MIDWEST. BURLINGTON DOWN THROUGH SCRANTON, PITTSBURGH AND AS FAR SOUTH AS KNOXVILLE COULD SEE THOSE STORMS DEVELOP. HAIL, WIND GUSTS AND THE HAIL THREAT IS FAIRLY LOW. AN ISOLATED TORNADO, WE CANNOT RULE THAT OUT. WIND GUSTS OF 60 MILES AN HOUR IS WHAT WE ARE ON TAP FOR. TWO INCHES FROM THE HIGHER AMOUNTS IN THE INTERIOR AREAS. THE NORTHEAST COULD PICK UP AN INCH OR TWO, NOTHING TOO IMPRESSIVE BUT WE WILL SEE IMPRESSIVE WINDS. 135 MILLION PEOPLE ARE UNDER THESE WIND ALERTS. THIS INCLUDES PARTS OF THE MIDWEST, MICHIGAN, OHIO. UP TO 43 MILES AN HOUR IN PLACES LIKE CHICAGO, TODAY. 39 MILES AN HOUR IN NEW YORK. 30 FOUR WASHINGTON DC SO I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF WE SEE SOME DOWNED POWER LINES AND DOWNED TREES. BEHIND THIS SYSTEM, REALLY COLD AIR IS WORKING IN. PLACES LIKE CHICAGO WERE AT THE MID-70s, TODAY, MUCH LOWER. >>> NEW CONCERNS ABOUT HEADPHONE AND CHILDREN'S HEARING.

A MEMBER OF THE LEGENDARY RAP GROUP CONSIDERED A PIONEER OF THE HIP-HOP MOVEMENT. >>> THE SUPREME COURT IS SET TO HEAR ARGUMENTS THAT COULD CHANGE GUN RIGHTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. BOTH THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION AND GUN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS APPEAL TO THE HIGHER COURT ASKED THE KING JUSTICES TO REVEAL -- ASKING JUSTICES TO REVEAL. >> THEY WERE BANNED UNDER THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION FOLLOWING THE LAS VEGAS MASS SHOOTING IN 2017. >> THIS CASE SEEMS TO COME DOWN TO WHAT QUALIFIES AS A MACHINE GUN. WALK US THROUGH THE ARGUMENTS. >> THIS IS NOT REALLY A CASE WHERE THE BUMP STOCKS ARE A GOOD IDEA. SOMETIMES, CONGRESS IS STUCK WITH THE WORDS USED IN THE STATUTE. CONGRESS DECIDED TO DEFINE A MACHINE GUN WHICH ARE ITEMS THAT HAVE BEEN ILLEGAL FOR A LONG TIME AS SOMETHING WHERE ONE PULL OF THE TRIGGER EXPELS MORE THAN ONE ROUND. IN OTHER WORDS, A SEMIAUTOMATIC GUN IS ONE PULL OF THE TRIGGER, ONE ROUND. ANYTIME YOU HAVE ONE -- MULTIPLE BULLETS COMING OUT WITH ONE PULL IS A MACHINE GUN. FOR THAT REASON, WHAT A BUMP STOCK DOES IS, IT MAKES YOUR FINGER BIONIC. ALL OF US HAVE HUMAN LIMITATIONS. IMAGINE YOU COULD PULL YOUR TRIGGER FINGER HUNDREDS OF TIMES IN A MINUTE. YOUR FIREARM WOULD NOT THEREBY BE ILLEGAL AND THAT IS THE ARGUMENT WITH BUMP STOCKS. ALL THEY DO IS ALLOW YOU TO PULL THE TRIGGER MANY TIMES FASTER THAN A HUMAN NORMALLY COULD. >> WINDOW GUN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS ARE TRYING TO CHALLENGE THESE BANS. >> ADC COURT HAS CONCLUDED AS I THINK YOU COULD THAT WHILE THIS REGULATION REALLY NEVER IMAGINED BUMP STOCKS, THE SPIRIT OF A MACHINE GUN IS SATISFIED BY A BUMP STOCK IF NOT THE LITERAL DEFINITION BUT TWO OTHER CIRCUITS -- CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS HAVE GONE THE OTHER WAY SAYING CONGRESS DEFINED IT AS ONE PULL, ONE BULLET AND THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THE BUMP STOCK BUT AT AN INCREASED RATE OF SPEED. >> THE SUPREME COURT AGREED TO HEAR TWO ADDITIONAL CASES JUST LAST WEEK. WHAT KIND OF LIMITATIONS COULD THOSE CASES HAVE? PAINT A PICTURE FOR US. >> IT IS A FIRST AMENDMENT CASE, A CASE WHERE THE STATE OF NEW YORK SENT A MEMO TO THE BANKS SAYING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, I SHOULD SAY, YOU SHOULD BE VERY CAREFUL WHO YOU ASSOCIATE WITH AND THE IRA SAYS THAT IS COERCION BY THE STATE AND IT INFRINGES ON OUR RIGHTS BUT ARE INTERESTING, BUMP STOCKS ARE KIND OF A RARITY UNLESS THEY RESULT IN A NATIONAL TRAGEDY BUT SOMETHING THAT AFFECTS EVERYDAY OWNERSHIP IS A FEDERAL STATUTE, 922, I HAVE DEALT WITH IT MANY TIMES AND I HAVE A CASE WITH IT RIGHT NOW WHERE IT PROHIBITS CERTAIN PEOPLE FROM OWNING FIREARMS. EVER SINCE THAT SUPREME COURT DECISION A FEW YEARS AGO, ALL OF THE STATUTES ARE UP IN THE AIR BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE STATES AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN PROHIBIT PEOPLE FROM OWNING. WE KNOW THEY CAN PROHIBIT SOME VIOLENT FELONS AND SOME OTHER PEOPLE BUT SOMEONE WITH A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ORDER? SOMEONE WHO IS A MISDEMEANOR -- HAS A MISDEMEANOR CONVICTION, A NONVIOLENT DELANIE?

LET'S TALK ABOUT THE GROWING CONCERNS OVER EARBUDS AND THE USE BY CHILDREN. MOST PARENTS SAY THEIR KIDS ARE USING THEM FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME. >> THIS POLL CAME IN AT AN INTERESTING TIME BECAUSE A MONTH AGO, THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS ALSO SOUNDED AN ALARM. NOT ONLY HEARING LOSS AND READING IN THE EARS BUT USING EARBUDS OR HEADPHONES ALL THE TIME CAN DISRUPT LEARNING AND LANGUAGE AND THIS POLL FOUND THAT TWO THIRDS OF PARENTS ARE USING THEM BUT ONE OUT OF FIVE ARE USING THEM FOR MORE THAN TWO HOURS WHICH IS BEYOND WHAT WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT. HALF OF PARENTS ARE SAYING THAT THE KIDS ARE USING THEM FOR LESS THAN AN HOUR WHICH IS GOOD. DOCTOR'S ORDERS, IF YOU ARE A PARENT AND YOU HAVE CHILDREN BETWEEN FIVE AND 12, YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO SET THESE CONTROLS. YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT YOUR KIDS PHONE AND THEIR DEVICES AND REMEMBER THE 6060 RULE. NOT MORE THAN 60 MINUTES A DAY AND NOT MORE THAN 60% OF MAXIMUM VOLUME. THE OTHER THING IS TO LOOK FOR SIGNS OF HEARING LOSS. YOUR KIDS MAY BE EXPERIENCING HEARING LOSS. ONCE YOU HAVE HEARING LOSS, YOU DO NOT GET IT BACK. THINGS LIKE SPEAKING LOUDLY, ASKING YOU TO REPEAT COULD BE SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS THAT YOUR CHILD MAY BE EXPERIENCING SOME HEARING LOSS AND YOU SHOULD HAVE THEM CHECKED OUT. >> LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS BELLY FAT AND BRAIN HEALTH CONNECTION. THIS IS OUT OF RUTGERS. >> FIRST OF ALL, THIS IS A UNIQUE STUDY BECAUSE THIS IS STUDYING THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN BELLY FAT AND THE RISK OF COGNITIVE DECLINE OR BASICALLY, AN ASSOCIATION WITH BRAIN HEALTH. PEOPLE IN THIS STUDY WERE CHILDREN OF PEOPLE WITH ALZHEIMER'S. THEY WERE ALREADY AT A GREATER RISK AND WHAT THEY FOUND FOR MEN ONLY IS THAT THEY HAD A GREATER AMOUNT OF FAT AROUND THE PANCREAS, IT WAS AROUND THE PANCREAS, IT WAS LINKED TO A DECLINE IN BRAIN VOLUME AND YOU WOULD SAY, WHY WOULD THAT BE? WHAT IS THE PANCREAS AND BRAIN CONNECTION? MAYBE IT HAS TO DO WITH INSULIN, FOR EXAMPLE. IF YOUR BODY IS NOT PRODUCING ENOUGH INSULIN, OR TYPE II DIABETES IS A RISK FACTOR. ABDOMINAL FAT IS NOT GOOD. FAT AROUND THE PANCREAS, FAT AROUND THE LIVER, WE KNOW THAT IS SOMETHING WE CALL A METABOLIC SYNDROME. YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THIS. THE FACT IN THIS AREA, I WILL REALLY TELESCOPE THIS OUT TO EVERYBODY, IT IS NOT A GOOD THING. WEIGHT LOSS IS THE NUMBER ONE THING YOU NEED TO DO, HERE. WITH THE METABOLIC SYNDROME, TYPE II DIABETES, HIGH CO- GLYCERIDES. THESE ARE THINGS YOU CAN TREAT TO PREVENT DOWN THE LINE HEART DISEASE AS WELL AS BRAIN DISEASE. >> A NEW REPORT FROM THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PREVENTATIVE MEDICINE ENCOURAGING KIDS TO PLAY SPORTS. WE KNOW IT CAN IMPROVE THEIR MENTAL HEALTH AND IT CAN ALSO SAVE THE UNITED STATES ECONOMY A LOT OF MONEY. >> IT SEEMS LIKE IF AN AI- GENERATED MODEL OF KIDS AND THEIR PARTICIPATION IN SPORTS AND BASICALLY WHAT THEY HAVE DETERMINED IS THAT, IF KIDS INCREASE EVEN BY 10%, THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN ORGANIZED TEAM SPORTS DOWN THE LINE, THAT WILL HELP PREVENT METABOLIC DISEASE, OVERWEIGHT AND OBESITY AS WELL AS IMPROVE THEIR MENTAL HEALTH WHICH WILL, IN TURN, SAY THE UNITED STATES ECONOMY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. IT IS A DIFFERENT WAY TO APPROACH, ""GET OUT AND MOVE."" I THINK WE USE A FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS. IT IS NEW TO MEDICINE, IF YOU WILL. OUR DOCTORS AND REPORTERS SAY GET YOUR KIDS INVOLVED IN TEAM SPORTS. START THEM YOUNG. THEY START TO LEARN ALL OF THESE HEALTHY BEHAVIORS. BUT WE CANNOT LEAVE WITHOUT A LITTLE FLY IN THE OINTMENT SOMEWHERE. WATCH OUT FOR BURNOUT.

NBC NEWS, LOS ANGELES. >>> LET'S CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION WITH THE TECH COMPANY. IT IS ALWAYS GREAT TO HAVE YOU. FROM WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT AI AND THE TECHNOLOGY, ARE THERE WAYS TO PREVENT A CREATION OF THESE DISTURBING IMAGES IN SENSITIVE PLACES LIKE SCHOOLS WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT KIDS? >> THAT IS PART OF THE CHALLENGE. THESE TOOLS ARE BECOMING INCREDIBLY ACCESSIBLE AND VERY EASY TO USE. ON THE ONE HAND, YOU CAN LOOK AT BROADER PROTECTIONS LIKE LIMITING THE DATA THAT IS AVAILABLE ABOUT YOU ONLINE ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO HIGHER-QUALITY PHOTOS AND THINGS. YOU CAN MAKE YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA PROFILE PRIVATE AND ENSURE THAT YOU ARE ONLY SHARING CONTENT WITH THOSE YOU TRUST AND THERE ARE WAYS TO DISTORT THE IMAGES THAT YOU UPLOAD SO THEY ARE NOT EASILY, THEY CANNOT BE PROCESSED BY AI VERY EASILY BUT THESE ARE NOT FOOLPROOF OR ENTIRELY REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS IN THE MODERN DIGITAL AGE. ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE IN HIGH SCHOOL. YOU MIGHT HAVE A SOCIAL MEDIA YOU MIGHT HAVE A SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNT AND EVEN IF YOU DON'T, YOUR SCHOOL YEARBOOKS AND THE INCIDENTS ARE HAPPENING AT HIGH SCHOOLS WHERE INTERACTIONS ARE PREDOMINANTLY WITHIN A KNOWN COMMUNITY. THERE IS A REASONABLE EXPERT PATIENT. TRUST AND SAFETY INTO DIGITAL SHARING WHICH IS WHY I THINK WE NEED TO STEP BACK AND LOOK AT MORE LEGISLATIVE PATHWAYS TO CREATE -- PREVENT THIS OR AT LEAST DETER IT BEFORE THE CONTENT IS BROUGHT OUT. >> A RECENT POLL FINDS AMERICANS ARE MORE CONCERNED THAN EXCITED ABOUT AI AND ITS POTENTIAL. HOW CAN WE BALANCE EVERYTHING THAT AI IS CAPABLE OF WHILE ALSO KEEPING IT FROM BECOMING TOO DAMAGING SO PEOPLE HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE FAITH? >> RIGHT BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY WAYS THAT AI WILL CHANGE SOCIETY FOR THE BETTER AND I THINK THAT IS GOING TO BE THE CASE. HOWEVER, IT FEELS LIKE WE ARE BLAMING AI EVERY TIME THERE IS THIS NEW CAPABILITY OF AI, WE SCRAMBLE BEHIND IT TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE DO THIS SAFELY. ONE, I THINK WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HARDENING OUR INSTITUTIONS FOR THE AI AGE. WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO CREATE MORE FORESIGHT AT THE GOVERNMENT LEVEL, AT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION LEVEL SO WE HAVE MORE TIME TO PREPARE AND IT DOESN'T ALWAYS FEEL LIKE WE ARE SCRAMBLING. THAT MEANS MAYBE ADDING MORE FLEXIBLE WAYS WE CAN ADAPT AND EVOLVE ALONGSIDE THE TECHNOLOGY WHILE ALSO ENSURING THAT INSTITUTIONS STAY FIXED AND STRUCTURED. >> IS THERE ANY WAY WE CAN PROTECT OURSELVES FROM FAKE AI CREATIONS? I HAVE SEEN HOW SIMPLE IT IS TO CREATE THESE IMAGES OR SOME OF THE AUDIO. HOW CAN YOU TRY TO NOT END UP IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS? >> AGAIN, IT WOULD COME DOWN TO LIMITING HOW MUCH YOU SHARE ONLINE AND YOUR DIGITAL FOOT RENT. I KNOW THIS IS REALLY HARD IN THE MODERN AGE TO AVOID BUT KEEPING THE SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS PRIVATE CAN BE MORE HELPFUL AND ENSURING WHAT YOU DO SHARE WITH PEOPLE THAT YOU TRUST AND YOU CAN LOOK INTO SOME OF THE TECHNICAL PROGRAMS THAT ALLOW YOU TO DISTORT SOME OF THE IMAGES BEFORE YOU UPLOAD THEM AND THAT DOESN'T CHANGE HOW WE SEE THEM AS HUMANS BUT IT CHANGES HOW AI WOULD SEE IT CHANGES HOW AI WOULD SEE THEM IN PROCESS. THAT WOULD BE MY ADVICE BUT I DO THINK WE NEED BROADER GOVERNMENT SUPPORT BECAUSE THIS ISN'T SOMETHING THAT CITIZENS, ON THEIR OWN, CAN DEAL WITH OR GRAPPLE WITH. >> AS ALWAYS, WE APPRECIATE IT WHEN YOU JOIN US. >>> COMING UP, A GOLDEN TICKET TO NOWHERE. WILLY WONKA-THEMED EXPERIENCE TURNED OUT TO BE A WORLD OF IMAGINATION. SOME PARENTS ACTUALLY CALLING THE COPS. >>> YOU COULD SAY IT IS BREAKING THE GLASS SLIPPER.

ALL WITH SHADES OF FIRE FESTIVAL WITH A HANDFUL OF CANDY INSTEAD OF THOSE CHEAP LOOKING SANDWICHES AND KIDS, THE VICTIMS, INSTEAD OF CONCERTGOERS. >>> TO FURTHER HIGHLIGHT THE POTENTIAL PERILS OF AI, TWO ACTORS WERE PROMISED 500 POUNDS TO PERFORM THAT WEEKEND, $630. THEY SAY THE SCRIPT HAD GIBBERISH WORDING AND CLAIMED IT WAS AI HAVE BEEN GENERATED -- AI-GENERATED. >>> APPLE IS PUTTING PLANS FOR AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE IN THE WORKS. >> APPLE HAS SCRAPPED PLANS TO DEVELOP AN ELECTRIC CAR AFTER A DECADE OF WORK.

HIRING HER OWN BLACK PRINCESS DRESSING UP AS CHARACTERS WHO WERE NOT ORIGINALLY BLACK. >> THE FOUNDER OF BLACK PROCESS PARTIES JOINS US NOW. WHAT A FUN IDEA THIS IS. I DO UNDERSTAND THE STORY CAME OUT OF SOME DIFFICULT EXPERIENCES. I KNOW THAT YOU WERE TOLD YOU CANNOT BE A PRINCESS. COULD YOU TELL US ABOUT THAT AND WHAT SPARKED THIS IDEA? >> WHEN I WAS IN THE SIXTH GRADE, I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO PLAY MY FIRST PART AND THE LEAD ROLES WENT TO OLDER STUDENTS. THAT ROLE WAS CINDERELLA. I THINK THERE WAS A BIT OF AN ISSUE BECAUSE I WAS YOUNGER AND BECAUSE I DID NOT HAVE THE TRADITIONAL LOOK. EVEN THOUGH THE CINDERELLA MOVIE HAD COME OUT, I THINK PEOPLE THOUGHT WHEN THEY SEE CINDERELLA. >> WHEN A KID SEES A PRINCESS WHO DOES LOOK LIKE THEM, WHAT IS THE IMPACT OF THAT? >> IT MAKES ME FEEL AMAZING. THEY WOULD SAY THINGS LIKE YOUR HAIR LOOKS JUST LIKE MINE WHEN I HAVE BRAIDS. WHEN I PERFORMED TATIANA, I WEAR MY NATURAL HAIR SO THEY WEAR MY NATURAL HAIR SO THEY CAN SEE HOW BEAUTIFUL THAT IS. I WANT THEM TO SEE THAT THEIR SKIN IS WORTHY OF BEING A PRINCESS, THEIR HAIR IS WORTHY OF BEING A PRINCESS AND EVERYTHING ABOUT THAT IS WORTHY AND BEAUTIFUL. >> DO YOU HAVE A SPECIFIC MEMORY OF A CHILD WHO HAS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL REACTION TO SEEING A BEAUTIFUL REACTION TO SEEING YOU IN CONCERT? >> TWO OF MY FAVORITE, TATYANA AND SHE SAID, YOU LOOK JUST LIKE ME AND THAT WAS VERY SPECIAL. I HAVE ALWAYS DONE PARTIES FOR KIDS -- NOT OF COLOR AND THEY WERE HOLDING UP THEIR DOLLS AND PAJAMAS SAYING, THAT IS YOU, RIGHT THERE. AND THAT WAS EXTREMELY SPECIAL BECAUSE THEY WERE ABLE TO SEE THE CHARACTERS, SEE THE JOY AND SEE THE FUN AND NOT LET SKIN COLOR GET INTO THE WAY OF THAT. >> LAST YEAR, WE SAW THE REACTION OF HALLIE BAILEY BEING CAST TO PLAY THE LITTLE MERMAID WHICH WAS SPECTACULAR, BY THE WAY. WHAT DOES NEED TO HAPPEN IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY TO MAKE SURE WE SEE MORE STORIES LIKE THAT TOLD? >> IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY, I GUESS I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE OPEN-MINDEDNESS AND MORE DEMONSTRATION OF THE TALENT THAT IS THERE AND LESS CONSIDERATION FOR THE WAY THINGS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN DONE. I THINK THAT IS WHAT IS REALLY SPECIAL ABOUT SEEING HOLLY. SHE WAS PERFECT IN THE ROLE. AND THAT IS WHAT REALLY MATTERS TO ME AS AN ENTERTAINER, TO BE ABLE TO DO THE ROLE JUSTICE. ESPECIALLY WHEN SKIN COLOR IS NO PART OF TELLING THE STORY. >> I JUST WATCHED THAT MOVIE RECENTLY. SHE REALLY DID NAIL IT. AND I FORGOT BY THE WAY HOW STRESSFUL THAT MOVIE IS. SO SURPRISED. >> WHAT IS YOUR MOST REQUESTED COSTUME? >> MY MOST REQUESTED IS PROBABLY TIANA AND ELSA BUT MY FAVORITE IS RAPUNZEL BECAUSE I GOT TO MAKE THIS BEAUTIFUL WIG. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH.

HIS DEFENSE TEAM HAS BEE SUCCESSFUL SLOWING THE CASE DOWN FOR MORE THAN A YEAR NOW THEY WANT IT MOVED OUT O TOWN ENTIRELY. BUT FOR THE FAMILIES OF THE FOUR VICTIMS, WHEN IT HAPPENS IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN WHERE BRYAN KOHBERGER SET TO APPEA BACK IN COURT TODAY, WHEN AN WHERE THE TRIAL WILL TAKE PLAC IS STILL IN THE AIR. THE JUDGE IS HESITANT TO SET A TRIAL DATE BUT THAT COULD CHANGE TODAY. WHILE KOHBERGER'S DEFENSE TEAM ARGUES HE CAN'T GET A FAIR TRIAL UNLESS IT IS MOVED OUT OF TOWN IT WAS HERE IN THIS CLOSE KNIT COMMUNITY THAT FOUR UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO STUDENTS WERE FOUND STABBED TO DEATH AT HOME I NOVEMBER OF 2022 FACING FOUR COUNTS OF FIRS DEGREE MURDER, A JUDGE ENTERED A PLEA OF NOT GUILTY O KOHBERGER'S BEHALF DEFENSE'S MOTIONS TO GET I THROWN OUT ALL GOING IN TH PROSECUTION'S FAVOR.

WHAT WILL THE JUDGE TAKE INT CONSIDERATION WHEN SETTING A DATE AND WHAT ARE THE DRAWBACK TO PUSHING IT OUT ANOTHER YEAR >> THE PROSECUTION ALWAYS WANT A FASTER TRIAL AND THE DEFENSE WANTS A SLOWER TRIAL BECAUSE OVER THE COURSE OF TIME, EVIDENCE TENDS TO DETERIORATE. WHAT THE JUDGE WILL LOOK LIKE IS WHAT THE PROSECUTION HAS ASKED FOR. THIS LOCATION IS RIGHT ACROS THE STREET FROM A SCHOOL ALL OF THE DISTRACTIONS COME WITH THE SCHOOL. THE PROSECUTION IS TRYING TO PUSH THIS CIRCUS FASTER AND SA WE NEED TO HAVE THIS HAPPEN THIS SUMMER THE DEFENSE TOOK THAT TO THEIR ADVANTAGE AND SAID, YOU WANT A SUMMER TRIAL, WE WILL DO IT NEXT SUMMER BECAUSE WE WILL NOT B READY THIS SUMMER. THE JUDGE HAS TO LOOK AT HOW PREPARED THE DEFENSE IS. THE JUDGE WILL LISTEN TO THE DEFENSE AND HAVE THE TRIAL NEX YEAR IS MY GUESS >> THE DEFENSE WANTS TO MOVE I OUT OF MOSCOW. THERE IS SO MUCH NATIONA ATTENTION, IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHERE YOU PUT IT. BUT IS THERE AN ARGUMENT THAT IT REALLY AFFECTED THE LOCA COMMUNITY A LOT SO HE CAN'T GE A FAIR TRIAL >> IT MAKES SENSE THAT THEY AR ASKING FOR A CHANGE OF VENUE BASED ON A LACK OF IMPARTIALIT BUT THE BAR IS QUITE HIGH. IT IS NOT EVEN INFLAMMATOR PRESS, IT IS INACCURATE PRES THE DEFENSE HAS TO SUBMI EVIDENCE THAT PEOPLE CHANG THEIR MINDS BECAUSE OF THE PRESS. IT IS UNLIKE LETO MEET THE BAR OF CHANGE OF VENUE BUT OF COURSE THE DEFENSE IS GOING TO TRY. earl earl >> LET'S TALK ABOUT DNA EVIDENCE AND EVIDENCE DETERIORATING OVE TIME >> IT IS FANCY BUT IT COMES DOWN TO WHAT WE HAVE ALREADY DONE, UP LOADING OUR OWN DNA SAMPLES TO PUBLIC WEBSITES.

AND THE PROSECUTION SAYS THAT IS IRRELEVANT, WE DIDN'T USE IT I THE WARRANT. THE FACT THAT THE PROSECUTION IS NOT REVEALING OR TELLING WHA WEBSITES THEY USED TENDS TO HAVE THE DEFENSE BE LIKE MISSIN SOMETHING, AND SAYING THIS I SHADY, WHY AREN'T YOU SHOWING US SOMETHING THAT IS PUBLIC THAT'S WHERE WE ARE WITH THA DEBATE >> IS THIS A DEBATE WE SEE OFTEN WHEN IT COMES TO ANY TRIALS OF THIS IT IS EVERYWHERE NOW IT FEEL LIKE >> THAT'S THE RIGHT QUESTION SO THIS HAPPENS EVERY DAY.

247,3-6FG5eaiiU,Meet the Press NOW â€” March 7,NBC News,2024-03-07 23:45:00+00:00,"APP NOW: >>. KRISTEN WELKER HOSTS MEET. >>. KRISTEN WELKER HOSTS MEET THE PRESS EVERY SUNDAY ON NBC. >>> WELCOME TO MEET THE PRESS. >>> WELCOME TO MEET THE PRESS NOW. I'M KRISTEN WELKER IN WASHINGTON, WHERE PRESIDENT BIDEN WILL SOON DELIVER HIS STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS. THE STAKES ARE HIGH FOR THE PRESIDENT, WHO WILL BE SPEAKING TO MILLIONS OF AMERICANS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE DONALD TRUMP BECAME THE PRESUMPTIVE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE, AND, AS DEMOCRATS ARE INCREASINGLY ANXIOUS ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S POLITICAL STANDING, AND AS REPUBLICANS ARE SIGNALING THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE BIDEN'S AGE AND FITNESS A PILLAR OF THEIR CAMPAIGN AGAINST HIM. FOR THOSE REASONS, THIS IS NO ORDINARY ADDRESS FOR THE PRESIDENT. HIS REMARKS WILL BE VIEWED NOT JUST AS A STATE OF THE UNION, BUT AS THE STATE OF HIS ARGUMENT FOR REELECTION. WHAT CAN WE EXPECT TONIGHT? WHITE HOUSE SOURCES TELL US THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO PRIMARILY TALK ABOUT KITCHEN TABLE ISSUES, LIKE SAVING PEOPLE MONEY, WHILE ALSO LAYING OUT HIS SECOND TERRIBLE AGENDA AND STRIKING A STRONG TONE ON REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS. HERE'S WHAT WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY SAID JUST YESTERDAY: >> THE PRESIDENT WILL OUTLINE AN AGENDA THAT IS ABOUT CONTINUING TO BUILD ON THE PROGRESS THAT WE'VE MADE OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS. THE PRESIDENT HAS ALWAYS BEEN AN OPTIMISTIC PERSON, AS YOU ALL KNOW, EVEN IN THE FACE OF CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US. HE WILL SHARE WHY HE IS HOPEFUL ABOUT THIS COUNTRY'S FUTURE AND WHY IT IS A MISTAKE. IT IS A MISTAKE TO BET AGAINST THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. >>. NOW OFFICIALS ALSO TELLING US. TODAY, THE PRESIDENT WILL ANNOUNCE AN EMERGENCY MISSION TO ESTABLISH A COURT ON THE GAZA COAST TO GET MORE HUMANITARIAN AID TO PALESTINIAN CIVILIANS IN INCREASINGLY DESPERATE NEED. WE'LL HAVE MORE DETAILS IN JUST MOMENT. FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN: TONIGHT, HIS PERFORMANCE IS GOING TO BE JUST AS IMPORTANT, IF NOT MORE. JUST AS IMPORTANT, IF NOT MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE POLICIES HE LAYS OUT. 76% ARE CONCERNED ABOUT HIS PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH FOR THE SECOND TERM. THAT INCLUDES DEMOCRATS AND INDEPENDENT VOTERS. AHEAD OF TODAY'S SPEECH, TRUMP CAMPAIGN ALLIES UNVEILED A BLISTERING ATTACK AD QUESTIONING IF THE PRESIDENT WILL LIVE FOR A FULL SECOND TERM. THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN CALLED THE AD A SICK AND DERANGED STUNT FROM A BROKE AND STRUGGLING CAMPAIGN DEMOCRATS ARE HOPING FOR A REPEAT OF LAST YEAR'S ADDRESS, WHERE THE PRESIDENT WAS SHARP, FORCEFUL AND QUICK TO RESPOND TO REPUBLICAN HECKLING. TAKE A LOOK. >>. SOME REPUBLICANS WANT MEDICARE AND SOCIAL SECURITY. SUNSET, I'M NOT SAYING IT'S A MAJORITY. OTHER REPUBLICANS SAY: I'M NOT SAYING IT'S THE MAJORITY OF YOU. I'M NOT EVEN SAYING IT'S SIGNIFICANT, BUT IT'S BEING PROPOSED BY INDIVIDUALS- I'M POLITELY NOT NAMING THEM BUT IT'S BEING PROPOSED BY SOME OF YOU. SO, FOLKS, AS WE ALL APPARENTLY AGREE, SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE IS OFF THE BOOKS NOW. RIGHT, THEY'RE NOT TO BE TOUCHED, ALL RIGHT, WE GOT UNANIMITY. >>. ONE OF THE MORE MEMORABLE MOMENTS FROM LAST YEAR. OF COURSE, THE PRESIDENT IS FACING THE VERY REAL POSSIBILITY OF DISRUPTIONS AGAIN TONIGHT, FROM REPUBLICANS ON THE ISSUE OF THE BORDER, FROM PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRATS ON THE SITUATION IN GAZA. THE BIG PICTURE FOLKS. THIS COULD BE THE SINGLE BIGGEST NIGHT IN PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS FOR A WHILE AND THE PRESIDENT'S BIGGEST AUDIENCE BEFORE THE ELECTION. AS PRESIDENT BIDEN LIKES TO TELL HIS DOUBTERS, WATCH ME WELL. MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WILL BE DOING JUST THAT TONIGHT. JOINING ME NOW, ON THIS VERY BIG DAY, IS NBC NEWS, SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT KELLY O'DONNELL. SAHIL KAPUR IS ON CAPITOL HILL, CHIEF FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT RICHARD ENGLE, AND ON SET IS SENIOR BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT CHRISTINE ROMANS. KELLY, I HAVE TO START WITH YOU AND THIS BIG NEWS COMING OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE. TODAY, THE PRESIDENT PLANNING TO MAKE THIS ANNOUNCEMENT ABOUT GAZA TO INCREASE AID THERE. WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THIS? >>. THIS WILL BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PRESIDENT TO ADDRESS ONE OF THE HOT ISSUES THAT HAS BEEN A CONFLICT HE'S BEEN DEALING WITH, AND ONE THAT HAS BROUGHT OUT A LOT OF PASSIONS AND EMOTIONS IN IN OUR COUNTRY AND AROUND THE WORLD. HE WILL LEAN IN HEAVILY TO HUMANITARIAN AID, CREATING WITH US MILITARY A GATE, IF YOU WILL. THAT WOULD ALLOW GREATER US HUMANITARIAN SUPPLIES TO FLOW INTO GAZA. PART OF WHAT I EXPECT WE'LL BE HEARING FROM THE PRESIDENT TONIGHT IS A VERY RAW ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THE PAIN OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE ISRAEL- GAZA WAR ON ALL SIDES AND, AT THE SAME TIME, THE EXTREME LOSS OF LIFE AND HARDSHIP FOR THE PALESTINIANS LIVING IN GAZA. WHAT MORE CAN THE US DO? THE US, OF COURSE, STILL WANTS A TEMPORARY CEASEFIRE, WANTS HOSTAGES TO BE RELEASED AND WANTS TO WORK ON FLOWING IN HUMANITARIAN AID WHILE ISRAEL HAS A RIGHT TO DEFEND ITSELF. BUT THIS WILL BE A WAY FOR THE PRESIDENT TO ANSWER SOME OF THE CRITICS WITHIN HIS OWN PARTY, SOME OF THE VOICES AROUND THE WORLD. IT'S A SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY FOR HIM TO ANNOUNCE A NEW PLAN TO DEMONSTRATE AMERICAN LEADERSHIP AND, AT THE SAME TIME, REALLY LET THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SEE HOW HE FEELS ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND ACKNOWLEDGING IT. WE HAVE SEEN MANY TIMES ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL WHERE THERE HAVE BEEN PROTESTS, WHETHER THEY WERE IN THE ROOM WITH THE PRESIDENT OR THEY WERE OUTSIDE AT EVENTS AND SO FORTH, IF THAT HAPPENS. TONIGHT, ADVISORS, I'VE TALKED TO SAY THE PRESIDENT, ADEPT AT HANDLING THOSE MOMENTS, WANTS PEOPLE TO BE HEARD. THERE ARE NOT ONLY LAWMAKERS IN THE CHAMBER, BUT EACH LAWMAKER HAS A GUEST. THEY SIT IN A GALLERY OUT OF CAMERA VIEW. TYPICALLY, THERE COULD BE THOSE SORTS OF INTERRUPTIONS. THE WHITE HOUSE IS PREPARED FOR THAT THEY EXPECT. IF IT HAPPENS, THE PRESIDENT WILL USE HIS SPONTANEITY, HIS ABILITY TO BE QUICK-MINDED IN THOSE MOMENTS, MUCH LIKE THE CLIP YOU PLAYED AT THE TOP, WHICH WAS A DIFFERENT SUBJECT, BUT THAT REACTING IN THE MOMENT WHICH THEY BELIEVE NOT ONLY ON SUBSTANCE IS IMPORTANT, BUT FOR A WAY FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO SEE THE PRESIDENT IN THE WAY ADVISORS SEE HIM IN A LONGER FORMAT, NOT JUST QUICK CLIPS ON THE INTERNET, A LONG SPEECH. THAT WILL GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO ADDRESS BIG POLICY ISSUES >>. WE SHOULD REMIND OUR VIEWERS- YOU HAVE OFTEN BEEN IN THAT CHAMBER WHEN THE PRESIDENT IS DELIVERING A STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS. TAKE US INSIDE TONIGHT'S CHALLENGES. HERE YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO'S RUNNING FOR REELECTION. HE'S IN A DEEPER POLITICAL HOLE THAN SOME OF HIS PREDECESSORS HEADING INTO TONIGHT'S SPEECH. THE PERFORMANCE AS YOU WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT IS GOING TO BE AS IMPORTANT AS ALL OF THESE POLICY ISSUES RIGHT >>. Reporter. MOST AMERICANS ARE NOT TUNED INTO THE PRESIDENT IN A WAY THAT YOU AND I ARE. IT'S OUR JOB TO FOLLOW ALL OF HIS SPEECHES. FOR MOST AMERICANS, THEY'RE SEEING SHORT CLIPS. THEY'RE NOT PAYING ATTENTION WITH THE SAME LEVEL OF INTEREST AND SEEING HIM IN A LONGER FORMAT WHICH, IN MANY WAYS, MIGHT GO AGAINST THE SHORTENED ATTENTION SPAN THAT WE'RE ALL SO ACCUSTOMED TO NOW. THEY WANT THAT MOMENT TO ALLOW HIM TO TELL THE STORY OF THE THINGS THEY BELIEVE HE'S ACCOMPLISHED. THE THINGS THAT HE STILL BELIEVES ARE YET TO BE DONE AND TO DRAW THE CONTRAST BETWEEN HIMSELF AND HIS PREDECESSOR. I DON'T EXPECT THAT THE PRESIDENT'S GOING TO CALL OUT DONALD TRUMP BY NAME, BUT HE WILL TALK ABOUT THE POLICIES. AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE ISSUE OF AGE WHICH THE WHITE HOUSE READILY ACKNOWLEDGES, IS ONE THAT IS ON THE MINDS OF AMERICAN VOTERS WHO ARE CONSIDERING THIS EXPECT TO HEAR THE KINDS OF THINGS. WE'VE BEEN HEARING THE PRESIDENT SAY IN A RECENT APPEARANCE HE DID ON LATE-NIGHT TV WITH SETH MEYERS, WHERE HE TALKED ABOUT OLD IDEAS VERSUS NEW IDEAS. THAT HE ARGUES HIS IDEAS ARE ABOUT THE FUTURE AND THAT HIS RIVAL ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE, HIS PREDECESSOR, IS ABOUT OLD IDEAS, MEANING THINGS LIKE ABORTION RIGHTS BEING TAKEN AWAY AND CONCERNS ABOUT VOTING RIGHTS AND DEMOCRACY. SO IT IS A CHANCE TO HAVE KIND OF A STAGE, CRAFT THEATRICAL MOMENT, A SORT OF WELLNESS CHECK ON THE PRESIDENT IN ADDITION TO A LOT OF SUBSTANTIVE ISSUES HE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT AND THE CONTRAST BETWEEN HIS VISION AND THAT OF DONALD TRUMP'S. >>. KELLY, YOU LAID OUT ALL OF THE STAKES FOR US. WITH THAT, LET'S GO OVER TO SAHIL, WHO IS ON CAPITOL EVENT, WHERE THE MAIN EVENT IS GOING TO TAKE PLACE. SET THE STAGE. WE KNOW THAT THE HOUSE SPEAKER HAS INVITED A NUMBER OF GUESTS, AS IS CUSTOMARY. WHO ARE THE GUESTS THAT STAND OUT TO YOU TONIGHT? >>. Reporter, THAT'S RIGHT SPEAKER, JOHNSON HAS INVITED A PRETTY EXPANSIVE LIST OF GUESTS TO THE STATE OF THE UNION. THAT POINT TO THE ISSUES HE WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT AS PRESIDENT BIDEN SPEAKS AT THAT LECTERN. THESE GUESTS INCLUDE PARENTS OF HOSTAGES IN ISRAEL TRYING TO DRAW ATTENTION TO THAT ISSUE. A FREED HOSTAGE IN ISRAEL TRYING TO CONVEY HIS SUPPORT AND HIS PARTY'S SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL. THEY INCLUDE A JEWISH STUDENT AT MIT AIMING TO DRAW ATTENTION TO THE ISSUE OF RISING ANTI- SEMITISM, PARTICULARLY ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES, TRYING TO DRAW ATTENTION TO THE NEXUS OF MIGRANTS COMMITTING CRIMES. ALSO, A MOM OF A CHILD KILLED BY AN MS-13 GANG. SAME SCENE HERE YOU KIND OF GET THE PICTURE- AND THE UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT WHO OPPOSES TRANSGENDER ATHLETES. ANOTHER ISSUE: THAT IS POPULAR AMONG CONSERVATIVE LAWMAKERS AND CONSERVATIVE CULTURE WARRIORS. IN PARTICULAR NOTABLY SPEAKER, JOHNSON IS BRINGING THE PARENTS OF IMPRISONED JOURNALIST WHO HAS BEEN IMPRISONED IN RUSSIA. THIS HAS RAISED EYEBROWS FROM JOHNSON'S CRITICS WHO SAY HE'S BLOCKING THE BIGGEST THING HE COULD BE DOING TO TRY TO CONFRONT AND TAKE ON RUSSIA. WE'LL BE HEARING MORE OUT OF THAT IN TERMS OF WHAT JOHNSON INTENDS TO DO. GOING FORWARD, JOHNSON HAS SAID QUOTE: WHILE AMERICA'S STATE OF THE UNION IS SADLY IN DECLINE, THESE INDIVIDUALS REMIND US OF AMERICA'S GREATNESS EVEN IN THE FACE OF SUCH CHALLENGING CIRCUMSTANCES. END QUOTE. JOHNSON IS HOPING THIS IS THE ONE AND ONLY TIME HE'S SITTING WITH PRESIDENT BIDEN AT THAT DAIS >>. IT WILL BE A STUNNING MOMENT TO SEE HIM THERE, HIS UNLIKELY PATH TO HIS CURRENT POST. LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS MESSAGE HE'S SENDING TO HIS CONFERENCE TO BE RESPECTFUL. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THIS SPEAKER TAKES VERY CAREFULLY. THE DECORUM OF THE HOUSE AND AGAIN AT THE OPEN OF THE SHOW, WE SHOWED THAT CLIP OF PRESIDENT BIDEN GETTING JEERED LAST YEAR AT THE STATE OF THE UNION. DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE OF HOW PEOPLE RESPONDED TO HIM. ARE WE EXPECTING TO SEE ROWDINESS TONIGHT ON THE FLOOR? >>. Reporter. YEAH, AT THE RISK OF QUOTING YOUR OWN GREAT REPORTING BACK TO YOU, JOHNSON WANTS HIS MEMBERS TO ESSENTIALLY BEHAVE. HE DOESN'T WANT TO SEE A REPEAT OF WHAT WE SAW YESTERDAY: THE YELLING AND THE INTERRUPTING AND THE HECKLING OF PRESIDENT BIDEN. IT DIDN'T WORK OUT WELL FOR REPUBLICANS. PRESIDENT BIDEN WAS ABLE TO HANDLE THAT WELL ON HIS SPEECH IN THE EYES OF HIS ALLIES AND IN THE WHITE HOUSE. THEY'D BE HAPPY FOR THAT TO HAPPEN. AGAIN TO YOUR SPECIFIC QUESTION, IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT JOHNSON'S MEMBERS ARE GOING TO LISTEN TO HIM. THE PEOPLE WHO ARE INVOLVED IN THIS LAST YEAR ARE NOT THE TYPES WHO ARE PARTICULARLY INCLINED TO LISTEN TO LEADERSHIP. THEY FANCY THEMSELVES REBELS AND TEND TO GO THEIR OWN WAY. WHAT THEY DO REMAINS TO BE SEEN. IT WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THEY DO. >>. I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED EITHER, AND OF COURSE WE'LL BE WATCHING FOR EVERY SHOUT, EVERY FACIAL EXPRESSION IN RESPONSE TONIGHT, BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT SO INTERESTING. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT GREAT REPORTING. WE WANT TO TURN IT TO NBC NEWS CHIEF FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT RICHARD ENGLE IN JORDAN >>. Reporter. WE SAW FIRSTHAND TODAY HOW THE AID OPERATIONS INTO GAZA ARE WORKING, THESE AIR DROPS? WE WERE ON A MILITARY PLANE THAT, LEFT FROM JORDAN IT FLEW THROUGH ISRAEL, OVER GAZA AND DROPPED PALETTES OF FOOD OVER THE NORTHERN GAZA STRIP, WHICH IS SEEING THE WORST HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN ALL OF GAZA. PEOPLE ARE STARVING TO DEATH THERE NOW, PARTICULARLY CHILDREN AND VULNERABLE PEOPLE, AND FROM WHAT WE WERE ABLE TO SEE IT IS HELPFUL. IT IS HELPING BUT IT IS NOT NEARLY ENOUGH. IT IS FAR TOO SLOW. VERY LIMITED AMOUNTS OF AID CAN GET IN. IT IS VERY EXPENSIVE AND IT IT IS EXTRAORDINARILY TIME CONSUMING THE ONE PLANE THAT WE WERE ON TODAY. THE ROUTE HAD TO BE CLEARED WITH THE ISRAELIS. IT INVOLVED A LARGE JORDANIAN AIR CREW, A VERY PROFESSIONAL AIR CREW. IT TOOK THEIR TIME. THEY HAD TO COORDINATE THE ROUTE WITH THE ISRAELIS TO MAKE SURE THERE WAS NO MID-AIR INCIDENT THAT THEY WEREN'T SHOT DOWN, AND THE KINDS OF ITEMS THAT THEY'RE ALLOWED BY THE ISRAELIS TO SEND IN IS LIMITED. THE PLANES HAVE TO BE INSPECTED. IT IS NOT THE KIND OF SOLUTION THAT WILL PROVIDE THE LEVEL OF RELIEF THAT GAZA NEEDS RIGHT NOW. NOW, PRESIDENT BIDEN IS EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE LATER TONIGHT, A NEW STEP THAT THE US MILITARY IS LEADING THE EFFORT TO OPEN A TEMPORARY PORT. THE ISRAELIS WELCOMING THAT DECISION, DESCRIBING IT AS A DOCK. THAT WOULD ALLOW FAR MORE AID TO GO INTO GAZA BY SHIP- THOSE SHIPS LEAVING FROM CYPRESS. BUT THAT IS SOMETHING. THAT IS GOING TO TAKE WEEKS TO ESTABLISH AND COULD TAKE MONTHS TO GET UP AND RUNNING EFFECTIVELY, LEAVING THE PEOPLE OF GAZA WITH A FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION: IS THERE GOING TO BE A CEASEFIRE SOON, OR ARE THAT GOING TO HAVE TO CONTINUE TO LIVE AS THEY'RE? TO CONTINUE TO LIVE AS THEY'RE LIVING RIGHT NOW IN INCREDIBLY PRECARIOUS SITUATION >>? THAT WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT ANNOUNCEMENT TONIGHT INDEED. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR GREAT REPORTING. WHAT TO TURN TO CHRISTINE ROMANS, WHO JOINS US HERE IN DC. I AM SO THRILLED YOU'RE HERE. >> GLAD TO BE HERE. >> THANK YOU FOR JOINING THE SHOW. LET'S START OFF. JUST BIG PICTURE. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE ECONOMY. WHEN PRESIDENT BIDEN TOOK OFFICE SEVERAL YEARS AGO, THAT WAS OBVIOUSLY ONE OF THE BIG HEAD WINDS. HE WAS FACING IT'S STILL, POLITICALLY SPEAKING- A HEAD WIND BUT THE PICTURE LOOKS DIFFERENT. >>. ARE YOU BETTER OFF TODAY THAN YOU WERE FOUR YEARS AGO? EXACTLY FOUR YEARS AGO, WAS THE BEGINNING OF COVID. THAT DISTORTS EVERY NUMBER. WE TALK ABOUT. WHAT YOU'LL HEAR FROM THE PRESIDENT TONIGHT, I THINK ARE TWO WAYS. HE'S GOING TO FRAME THE ECONOMY ONE. PEOPLE FEEL NICKELED AND DIMED, AND HE KNOWS IT. COMPANIES ARE MAYBE NOT PASSING ALONG SOME OF THEIR OWN COST SAVINGS- THEY HAVE PRICES TOO HIGH. HE'S TRYING TO ROOT OUT PLACES WHERE THEY CAN LOWER COSTS FOR AMERICANS IN EVERYTHING: FROM HOUSING YOU KNOW TO CONCERT TICKETS, TO BANK FEES- LOTS OF DIFFERENT THINGS. YOU'LL ALSO HEAR ABOUT TAX FAIRNESS AND TALK ABOUT HIS BUDGET NEXT WEEK AND TALK ABOUT STARTING TO CUT DEFICITS, RIGHT AND TACKLE SOME OF AMERICA'S FISCAL PROBLEMS BY RAISING TAXES ON CORPORATIONS AND RICH PEOPLE >>. AND LET'S JUST DELVE INTO THE TAX PORTION OF THIS A LITTLE BIT, BECAUSE IT'S GETTING A LOT OF BUZZ >> UH-HUH >>. DO WE HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT HE'S GOING TO ANNOUNCE? HE'S GOING TO ANNOUNCE NEW TAXES ON LARGE CORPORATIONS. >>. HE WANTS TO RAISE THAT CORPORATE MINIMUM TAX. REMEMBER IN 2017, BUSH OR TAX CUTS FROM TRUMP? THEY WERE HUGE TAX CUTS, BIGGER THAN COMPANIES HAD BEEN ASKING FOR. HE WOULD RAISE THAT A LITTLE BIT, HE SAID HE WOULD NOT RAISE TAXES ON ANYBODY MAKING $400,000 A YEAR OR LESS. ON MILLIONAIRES. THERE WILL BE A TAX DEDUCTION THAT COMPANIES CAN TAKE OFF THOSE SALARIES. THAT HE'D GET RID OF THAT TAX DEDUCTION FOR COMPANIES THAT BUY BACK THEIR OWN STOCK. HE WOULD QUADRUPLE THE TAX ON STOCK. BUY BACKS, HE SAID HE WOULD MAKE IT MORE FAIR- THE TAX CODE MORE FAIR. YOU'LL HEAR A LOT ABOUT FAIRNESS AND HOW HE'S THE GUY ON THE SIDE OF FAMILIES AND THE OTHER SIDE IS ON THE SIDE OF CORPORATIONS AND BIG INTERESTS >>. HIS BIGGEST CHALLENGE, CHRISTINE, IT SEEMS TO ME, IS THIS DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE NUMBERS AND HOW PEOPLE FEEL ABOUT THE NUMBERS, THE IN FACT THAT INFLATION HAS COME DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY JUST SINCE LAST YEAR. IS THERE A SENSE THAT, OVER TIME, PEOPLE WILL START TO FEEL IT? WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN IN ORDER FOR PRICES AT THE GROCERY STORE TO GO DOWN >>. CERTAINLY THE HOPE AMONG ECONOMISTS AND WHITE HOUSE ECONOMISTS IS, OVER TIME, PEOPLE WILL START TO FEEL IT. WAGES HAVE BEEN RISING MORE THAN INFLATION. THAT DISCONNECT IS JARRING. THOSE INFLATION SCARS, KRISTEN, ARE DEEP AND THEY ARE FRESH, AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT GROCERY PRICES, THIS IS THE NUMBER I REALLY LIKE TO QUOTE. FROM JANUARY 2020 TO TODAY, GROCERY PRICES ARE 25% HIGHER, SO YOUR GROCERY BILL IS A QUARTER MORE TODAY THAN IT WAS AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS CRISIS. THAT'S SOMETHING PEOPLE FEEL EVERY WEEK OR SO. SO YOU CAN TALK ABOUT A STOCK MARKET AT RECORD HIGHS, A RECORD BIG SIZE OF THE AMERICAN ECONOMY, RECORD SMALL BUSINESS CREATION OVER AROUND, OVER AGAIN, BUT IT COMES DOWN TO THOSE FRESH INFLATION WOUNDS AND HOW LONG IT TAKES PEOPLE TO START FEELING A LITTLE BETTER ABOUT THINGS >>. AND JUST FINALLY, CHRISTINE, STUDENT LOANS HAVE BEEN A BIG ISSUE FOR PEOPLE ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. THE PRESIDENT'S CANCELED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN STUDENT LOAN DEBT AND YET, THERE'S MORE HE SAYS HE'S PLANNING TO DO >>. THERE'S A NEW PROGRAM HE STARTED CALLED THE SAVE PROGRAM FOR PEOPLE WHO QUALIFY AND SIGN UP FOR THIS. YOU DON'T PAY MORE THAN YOU CAN AFFORD FOR HOW MUCH MONEY YOU MAKE AND YOU DON'T HAVE THE INTEREST GROWING MORE AND MORE AND MORE EVEN AS YOU'RE PAYING THE BILL DOWN. AND IN JULY PEOPLE WILL START TO FEEL SOME REAL, REAL RELIEF. HE'S GOING TALK ABOUT THAT AGAIN, TONIGHT- REMEMBER IT WAS A CAMPAIGN PROMISE TO CUT ALL THAT STUDENT LOAN DEBT. THE SUPREME COURT SAID: NO, YOU CAN'T DO IT. HE'S GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW HE'S FOUND OTHER WAYS TO USE THE POWERS AND THE LEVERS THAT HE HAS TO TRY TO GET SOME RELIEF TO PEOPLE WITH THESE STUDENT LOANS >>. I KNOW THAT THE ECONOMIC PIECE OF THIS, THE ECONOMIC MESSAGE, IS JUST GOING TO BE A REALLY SIGNIFICANT PART OF THIS SPEECH. PEOPLE WILL BE PAYING CLOSE ATTENTION TO THANK YOU FOR HELPING US UNDERSTAND IT. GREAT TO SEE YOU, CHRISTINE >>>. AND SPECIAL COVERAGE OF STATE OF THE UNION. THE STATE OF THE UNION BEGINS RIGHT HERE ON NBC NEWS NOW AT 8:00 PM EASTERN. WE'LL BE ON THE AIR UNTIL MIDNIGHT WITH ALL OF THE HIGHLIGHTS AND ANALYSIS AND COMING UP. WE HAVE BREAKING NEWS OUT OF NASHVILLE, WHERE FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS JUST ANNOUNCED CHARGES AGAINST AN ARMY SERGEANT FOR ALLEGEDLY LEAKING MILITARY SECRETS TO THE CHINESE FIRST THROUGHOUT. THE HOUR WE'LL BE TAKING A LOOK BACK AT STATES OF THE UNION DELIVERED BY PRESIDENTS AS THEY WERE SEEKING REELECTION, STARTING WITH FORMER PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN IN 1984.. >>. THE TIDE OF THE FUTURE IS A FREEDOM TIDE AND OUR STRUGGLE FOR DEMOCRACY CANNOT AND WILL NOT BE DENIED. >> [ APPLAUSE ]. >>. THIS NATION CHAMPIONS PEACE BUT IT SHRINES LIBERTY, DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS AND DIGNITY FOR EVERY INDIVIDUAL. AMERICA'S NEW STRENGTH, CONFIDENCE AND PURPOSE ARE OVER. IF IT'S SUNDAY, IT'S MEET THE PRESS >>> AND WELCOME BACK. WE'RE FOLLOWING BREAKING NEWS OUT OF NASHVILLE, WHERE FEDERAL PROSECUTORS HAVE JUST UNSEALED AN INDICTMENT AGAINST AN ARMY SERGEANT WHO, THEY SAY, TRANSMITTED SENSITIVE MILITARY INFORMATION TO A CO-CONSPIRATOR IN CHINA. TOM JOINS ME NOW WITH MORE. SO, TOM, WHAT DO WE KNOW? WHAT'S THE LATEST HERE? >>. Reporter. THE FBI ARRESTED CORBIN SCHULTZ, WHO IS A SERGEANT AT FORT CAMPBELL IN TENNESSEE. THE ARREST IS PART OF AN ONGOING INVESTIGATION SINCE JUNE OF 2022.. ACCORDING TO THE INDICTMENT, SCHULTZ HAS BEEN STEALING US MILITARY SECRETS AND PROVIDING IT TO A CO-CONSPIRATOR BASED IN HONG KONG FOR APPROXIMATELY $42,000 IN CASH OVER THAT TIME PERIOD. THE LIST OF WHAT HE STOLE IS FAIRLY, INCREDIBLE, INCLUDING- AND I'M JUST READING FROM THE INFORMATION WE'RE GETTING AS IT'S COMING IN LITERALLY AS I SPEAK TO YOU- AIR FORCE TACTICS AND TECHNIQUES FOR THE F-22 FIGHTER AIRCRAFT, ONE OF THE MOST SOPHISTICATED ON THE PLANET, TALKING ABOUT TECHNIQUES AND PROCEDURES FOR CERTAIN HELICOPTERS, AS WELL AS THE US' CAPABILITIES AND UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF CHINA ATTACKED TAIWAN. THE US' UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THAT MIGHT LOOK LIKE FROM THE CHINESE SIDE AND WHAT TYPE OF RESPONSE COULD BE THERE. OBVIOUSLY, THAT COULD BE POTENTIALLY HELPFUL TO THIS CO CONSPIRATOR BASED IN CHINA. IF HE'S SHARING THAT INFORMATION OR IS A MEMBER OF THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT- THERE'S SOME OTHER DETAILS AND INFORMATION IN IF HERE AS WELL, BUT HE DID POSSESS, OBVIOUSLY, A CLEARANCE TO ACCESS THIS INFORMATION AND APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN DOING IT ALL FOR CASH. THEY DON'T EXPLICITLY SAY HE PASSED THIS ALONG TO THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT, BUT WE'RE WAITING FOR THE 25-PAGE INDICTMENT TO BE UNSEALED. WE HAVE A LIMITED AMOUNT OF INFORMATION FROM THE PRESS RELEASE AT THIS POINT. THE NASHVILLE REGION. THIS PRESS CONFERENCE CALLED JUST SEVERAL HOURS, PRESUMABLY FOLLOWING THIS ARREST. HE WAS ARRESTED ON AN INDICTMENT MEANING. THIS INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR SOME TIME AND WAS ARRESTED AT FORT CAMPBELL. MORE DIGGING AND INFORMATION FOR US TO GATHER KRISTEN, I THINK, TAKING A STEP BACK HERE AND LOOKING AT THIS. IN TOTALITY, WE'VE HAD A WEEK OF POTENTIALLY REALLY TROUBLING INFORMATION INVOLVING THE US MILITARY AND ITS SECRETS. EARLIER THIS WEEK, WE HAD THE SENTENCING FOR THE GUILTY PLEA OF JACK TOSHERA, ARRESTED A YEAR AGO FOR SHARING TOP SECRET SOME VERY SERIOUS SECRET INFORMATION ONLINE IN THE ONLINE PLATFORM DISCORD, WHICH AUTHORITIES WERE ABLE TO TRACK HIM DOWN TO THAT WE HAD ANOTHER MEMBER OF THE US MILITARY CHARGED FOR SHARING INFORMATION OVER A DATING APP WITH SOMEBODY BASED IN UKRAINE, INCLUDING WHAT THE US WAS DOING OR KNEW ABOUT, WITH RESPECT TO UKRAINE MILITARY CAPABILITIES AND OUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE CONFLICT THERE. AND NOW YOU HAVE MORE INFORMATION, THIS TIME GOING TO ANOTHER POTENTIAL US ADVERSARY IN CHINA, AND THIS INFORMATION APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN QUITE SENSITIVE AND ALSO HAS TO DO WITH EXPORT CONTROL ITEMS. SO, IN OTHER WORDS, ACTUAL US MILITARY TECHNOLOGY AND CAPABILITIES. SO OBVIOUSLY A SERIOUS INVESTIGATION LED BY THE COUNTER-INTELLIGENCE DIVISION AND SOMETHING WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO TRACK HERE THROUGH THE AFTERNOON. >>. ALL RIGHT, TOM, I KNOW THIS IS JUST BREAKING AND YOU GAVE US A REALLY ROBUST DOWNLOAD, SO WE APPRECIATE THE GREAT REPORTING. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. >>>. COMING UP NEXT, A DEMOCRATIC SENATOR WHO'S AT THE CENTER OF THE ACTION FOR HER PARTY ON THE HILL AND TINA SMITH JOINS US NEXT. BUT FIRST, A LOOK BACK AT PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON'S STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS IN 1996, AS HE SET A COURSE FOR REELECTION. >> THE ERA OF BIG GOVERNMENT IS OVER. >> [ APPLAUSE ] >>. BUT WE CANNOT GO BACK TO THE TIMES WHEN OUR CITIZENS WERE LEFT TO FEND FOR THEMSELVES INSTEAD. WE MUST GO FORWARD AS ONE AMERICA, ONE NATION WORKING. >>> WELCOME BACK. >>> WELCOME BACK. AS WE MENTIONED, THE PRESIDENT'S STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS WILL CARRY EXTRA SIGNIFICANCE TONIGHT AS HE LAYS OUT HIS VISION FOR A SECOND TERM WITH A REMATCH AGAINST FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP NOW ESSENTIALLY SET OF COURSE. THE FATE OF ANY SECOND TERM BIDEN AGENDA WILL HINGE ON WHICH PARTY CONTROLS. CONGRESS AND DEMOCRATS ARE FIGHTING AN UPHILL BATTLE TO HOLD ON TO THE SENATE. 33 SENATE SEATS ARE ON THE BOARD THIS NOVEMBER. DEMOCRATS ARE DEFENDING 23 OF THEM, WITH A NUMBER OF RACES IN RED-LEANING STATES AND KEY PRESIDENTIAL BATTLEGROUNDS. JOINING ME IS DEMOCRATIC SENATOR FROM MINNESOTA, TINA SMITH, AND VICE CHAIR FOR THE CAMPAIGN ARM FOR SENATE DEMOCRATS. THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME, SENATOR. REALLY APPRECIATE IT. >>. I'M SO GLAD TO BE WITH YOU. >>. WE ARE SO GLAD TO HAVE YOU AND YOUR PERSPECTIVE PRESIDENT, BIDEN OF COURSE GETTING READY TO DELIVER HIS STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS. HE IS FACING, AS YOU KNOW, SOME HEAD WINDS AS IT RELATES TO THE WAR IN THE MIDDLE EAST, AS IT RELATES TO HIS AGE. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO HEAR FROM HIM TONIGHT? WHAT DOES HE NEED TO DO TO HAVE IT BE A SUCCESSFUL NIGHT? >>. I THINK THE PRESIDENT IS GOING INTO THIS EVENING REALLY READY TO MAKE HIS CASE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ABOUT THE PROGRESS THAT WE'VE MADE, THE WORK THAT WE HAVE LEFT TO DO, AND THE GREAT CONTRAST BETWEEN HIS APPROACH AND THE APPROACH OF DEMOCRATS AND THE APPROACH OF REPUBLICANS. I'M EXPECTING HIM TO BE VERY SPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT HE HAS DONE- WHAT WE'VE DONE- TO LOWER COSTS FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND TO EXPAND ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE BUT THEN ALSO TO TALK ABOUT HIS VISION FOR WHAT MORE WE NEED TO DO. TO CONTINUE TO LOWER COSTS OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, TO LOWER HOUSING COSTS, TO GET AFTER THIS KIND OF CORPORATE GREED THAT IS DRIVING UP PRICES IN SOME AREAS AND LEAVING A LOT OF AMERICANS JUST WONDERING WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON? >>. WHAT DO YOU THINK HE NEEDS TO DO TO QUELL THE CONCERNS ABOUT HIS AGE? IF YOU LOOK AT THE POLLS, MORE THAN 70% OF AMERICANS SAY THEY DO HAVE REAL CONCERNS ABOUT HIS AGE AND HIS ABILITY TO SERVE A SECOND TERM >>. WELL, YOU KNOW TONIGHT HE IS REALLY IN HIS ELEMENT. HE IS SO COMFORTABLE IN THIS BUILDING. HE IS ACCUSTOMED TO THE TRADITIONS AND THE KIND OF WAY THAT PEOPLE BEHAVE IN THIS BUILDING. AND I'LL JUST REMIND YOU THAT LAST YEAR, WHEN HE WAS KIND OF GOT SOME FEEDBACK FROM THE AUDIENCE AS HE WAS GIVING HIS SPEECH. HE REALLY ENGAGED WITH THAT. I THINK IT SHOWED HIM FOR THE PERSON HE REALLY IS READY TO ENGAGE, READY TO DIVE INTO IT AND READY TO MAKE HIS CASE. I FEEL LIKE HE'S GOING TO BE IN A VERY GOOD PLACE AS HE GOES INTO THE SPEECH TONIGHT. THAT'S PART OF IT, BUT I THINK IT'S AMERICANS WANTING TO HEAR. WHAT DOES HE WANT TO DO AND WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE AS WE LOOK TOWARD THE COMING YEAR? >>. WE HAD REPORTED THAT THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE BORDER BUT HE'S NOT GOING TO UNVEIL ANY NEW EXECUTIVE ACTIONS THOUGH? WE KNOW THE ADMINISTRATION IS CONSIDERING EXECUTIVE ACTIONS AS IT RELATES TO ASYLUM. DO YOU THINK THAT'S A MISTAKE TO NOT ROLL OUT SOMETHING NEW ON THE BORDER ISSUE TONIGHT, TO USE THIS MASSIVE PLATFORM TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE >>? YEAH, HERE'S WHAT I THINK ABOUT THAT. YOU KNOW WE HAVE A BIPARTISAN AGREEMENT THAT WAS STRUCK BETWEEN DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS IN THE SENATE, WITH A LOT OF FEEDBACK AND GREAT SUPPORT FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED? DONALD TRUMP AND THE REPUBLICANS SAID NO, WE DON'T WANT TO ACTUALLY MAKE PROGRESS ON THE BORDER AND ON BORDER SECURITY. WE'D LIKE TO KEEP THIS AS A POLITICAL ISSUE. I THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS LAID OUT WHAT HE THINKS NEEDS TO HAPPEN AT THE BORDER. LET'S TAKE THE ISSUE OF STOPPING THE FLOOD OF FENTANYL AT OUR SOUTHERN BORDER AND THE NEED TO HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY AND THE BORDER SECURITY IN PLACE TO STOP THAT. WE HAVE A PLAN FOR THAT AND THE REPUBLICANS HAVE SAID NO. SO I THINK HE WILL MAKE THAT CASE TONIGHT, AS WELL HE SHOULD. >>. AND LET'S TALK NOW ABOUT YOUR HOME STATE OF MINNESOTA. WE SAW THAT UNCOMMITTED VOTE, WHICH WE ALSO SAW IN MICHIGAN- 19% IN MINNESOTA IN THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY. IT WAS A PROTEST VOTE- EFFECTIVELY FOR VOTERS TO PROTEST PRESIDENT BIDEN'S HANDLING OF THE ISRAEL-GAZA WAR, OR ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR, THE WAR IN GAZA. HOW CONCERNED ARE YOU ABOUT THAT BEING AN ELECTORAL PROBLEM FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN COME NOVEMBER? >>. SO WHAT I THINK HAPPENED IN MINNESOTA IS THAT, FIRST OF ALL, MINNESOTA HAS A LONG AND STRONG TRADITION OF ACTIVISM AND GRASSROOTS ORGANIZING, AND I THINK WHAT WE SAW ON TUESDAY WAS PEOPLE WHO ARE SO DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN GAZA AND THEY WANTED TO MAKE THEIR VOICES HEARD IN THAT ELECTION. AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED AND WHAT I HAVE BEEN SAYING TO PEOPLE, AND WHAT I REALLY TRULY BELIEVE IS THAT THE PRESIDENT SHARES THEIR CONCERNS. HE IS WORKING HARD TO REACH A PLACE WHERE WE CAN HAVE A STOP TO THE VIOLENCE, WE CAN HAVE A LONG CEASEFIRE, WE CAN RETURN THE HOSTAGES AND THEN WE CAN MOVE TO WHERE WE NEED TO GET TO, WHICH IS A WAY FOR BOTH ISRAEL AND PALESTINIANS IN THE REGION TO HAVE THEIR OWN STATES WHERE EVERYONE CAN LIVE IN PEACE AND DIGNITY. I THINK, IN MANY WAYS, THE PRESIDENT SHARES THE CONCERNS OF THOSE, BUT YOU'RE ASKING AN ELECTORAL QUESTION, WHICH I RESPECT AND MY STRONG VIEW IS KNOWING. MANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO VOTED UNCOMMITTED ON TUESDAY IS THAT THAT IS NOT A REFLECTION OF HOW THEY INTEND TO VOTE IN NOVEMBER. THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT CHOICE IS AND THEY KNOW CLEARLY THAT IF YOU CARE ABOUT PALESTINIANS IN THE MIDDLE EAST, THAT DONALD TRUMP IS A DISASTER. >>. LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT SENATOR MENENDEZ. IF I COULD ONE OF YOUR COLLEAGUES, HE'S NOW FACING YET ANOTHER INDICTMENT, THIS TIME BEING CHARGED WITH OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE. YOU HAD PREVIOUSLY RESISTED CALLS FOR HIM TO RESIGN. DOES THIS LATEST INDICTMENT CHANGE YOUR PERSPECTIVE AT ALL, SENATOR? DO YOU THINK IT'S TIME FOR HIM TO STEP DOWN? >>. WELL, LOOK, I'M DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE ALLEGATIONS AROUND SENATOR MENENDEZ. I THINK THAT IT IS EXTREMELY TROUBLING TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH. WHAT I AM FOCUSED ON IS I THINK ABOUT MY ROLE IN THE CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE AND MAKING SURE THAT WE WIN. MAKE SURE THAT DEMOCRATS WIN IN NEW JERSEY AND THAT DEMOCRATS WIN AROUND THE COUNTRY, SO WE CAN KEEP AND EVEN EXPAND ON OUR MAJORITY, AND THAT'S WHERE MY FOCUS IS. >>. LET ME ASK YOU THIS JUST TO FOLLOW UP: DO YOU BELIEVE THE DSCC SHOULD PROVIDE FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO SENATOR MENENDEZ IF HE DOES DECIDE TO RUN FOR REELECTION? >>. LET'S JUST BE CLEAR. HE HASN'T ANNOUNCED WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO. WE HAVE TWO CANDIDATES WHO ARE RUNNING IN NEW JERSEY, WHO HAVE ANNOUNCED AND WHO ARE WORKING REALLY, REALLY HARD. I'M GOING TO LET THAT PROCESS TALLY OUT, AND THE DEMOCRATIC SENATORIAL CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE IS GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WIN. I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT NEW JERSEY HAS ELECTED A DEMOCRAT AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL FOR MANY, MANY YEARS, AND I THINK THAT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING IS PUTTING OUR RESOURCES INTO THE STATES WHERE WE NEED TO. I WOULD POINT YOU TO WHAT HAPPENED THIS WEEKEND IN TEXAS, WHERE WE HAVE A VERY STRONG CANDIDATE READY TO CHALLENGE TED CRUZ, ONE OF THE MOST UNPOPULAR REPUBLICANS IN THE COUNTRY, WHO WON IN A NINE- PERSON FIELD COLLIN ALLRED WITH ALMOST 60% OF THE VOTE. THERE ARE LOTS OF PLACES. WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING TO BUILD OUR SUPPORT AND, I BELIEVE, PROTECT AND EVEN EXPAND OUR MAJORITY >>. SENATOR, I DON'T HEAR A YES OR A NO. ARE YOU WILLING TO GO SO FAR AS TO GIVE A SPECIFIC ANSWER ON THAT, OR YOU'RE GOING TO WAIT? >>. THERE'S TOO MANY HYPOTHETICALS INVOLVED IN THAT, AND WHO'S GOING TO BE THE CANDIDATE? WE'LL WAIT TO SEE HOW THAT PANS OUT. I DON'T EXPECT YOU'LL SEE THE DSCC PUTTING RESOURCES INTO NEW JERSEY, WHICH IS A STRONG DEMOCRATIC STATE WHERE OUR DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES TYPICALLY WIN >>. LET ME GET YOUR REACTION TO SENATOR SINEMA, WHO BECAME THE LATEST SENATOR TO ANNOUNCE SHE'S NOT GOING TO SEEK REELECTION. WITH RECENT POLLING SHOWING KYRSTEN SINEMA PULLING FAR MORE REPUBLICAN VOTERS. HER DECISION TO RETIRE IMPROVES CARRIE LAKE'S OPPORTUNITY TO FLIP THIS SEAT. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT? WHAT'S YOUR RESPONSE? >>. THAT'S A NOBLE EFFORT TO PUT A PRETTY FACE ON. WHAT IS A VERY CHALLENGING SITUATION FOR REPUBLICANS IN ARIZONA: SENATOR SINEMA ANNOUNCING THAT SHE'S NOT PLANNING ON RUNNING. WE HAVE A VERY STRONG CANDIDATE IN ARIZONA IN RUBEN GALLEGOS. THE POLLING SHOWS THAT RUBEN DOES BETTER IN A TWO-PERSON RACE BEATING KARI LAKE, WHO IS KIND OF THE REPUBLICAN'S WORST NIGHTMARE. NOT ONLY DOES SHE DENY THAT JOE BIDEN WON THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, BUT SHE DENIES SHE LOST THE GUBERNATORIAL ELECTION, SO SHE'S RUNNING FOR ELECTION AT THE SAME TIME. SHE'S DENYING SHE LOST THE GOVERNOR'S RACE >>. WE SURE DID COVER A LOT OF GROUND TODAY. I APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. >>. THANK YOU >>>. COMING UP THE TOUGH TASKS AHEAD TONIGHT FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN IN BOTH STYLE AND SUBSTANCE AND THE FALLOUT FROM A NEW ATTACK AD, FROM A PRO-TRUMP SUPER PACK THAT THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN IS CALLING A QUOTE DERANGED STUNT. THE PANEL WILL BE HERE TO DISCUSS THAT. AS WE TAKE A BREAK, A LOOK BACK AT PRESIDENT GEORGE W BUSH'S STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS AS HE SOUGHT REELECTION >>. FOR ALL AMERICANS, THE LAST THREE YEARS HAVE BROUGHT TESTS WE DID NOT ASK FOR- AND ACHIEVEMENTS SHARED BY ALL. BY OUR ACTIONS, WE HAVE SHOWN WHAT KIND OF NATION WE ARE IN GRIEF. WE HAVE FOUND THE GRACE TO GO ON IN CHALLENGE. WE REDISCOVERED THE COURAGE AND DARING OF A FREE PEOPLE IN VICTORY. WE HAVE SHOWN THE NOBLE AIMS AND GOOD HEART OF AMERICA AND HAVING COME THIS FAR, WE WOMEN AND CHILDREN >>>. THE STAKES COULDN'T BE HIGHER FOR THE NATION AND HIS OWN. FOR THE NATION AND HIS OWN PRESIDENCY IS AT STAKE. IN THIS SINGLE ADDRESS. NOTHING HAS MATTERED MORE THAN THIS ONE. WHAT'S AT STAKE IS NOT THE ISSUE HERE, IT'S THE WAY HE COMES ACROSS. HE NEEDS TO BE SOMEONE WHO IS AUTHENTIC AND REAL AND BELIES ALL OF THE CHATTER >>. WELL, THAT SETS US UP NICELY. THAT WAS CONNECTICUT'S SENIOR SENATOR BLUMENTHAL TALKING ABOUT WHAT'S AT STAKE TONIGHT FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN. FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN, I'M JOINED BY MY GREAT PANEL. THANKS TO ALL OF YOU FOR BEING HERE, REALLY APPRECIATE. MIKE, I HAVE TO START WITH YOU. YOU HAVE BEEN AT THE WHITE HOUSE WORKING. YOUR SOURCES SET THE SCENE. HOW ARE THEY VIEWING TONIGHT AND WHAT ARE YOU WATCHING FOR? >>. THIS IS A CRITICAL OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS WHAT HAS BEEN THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM, THE ISSUE OF HIS AGE. WE'VE BEEN REPORTING ON THIS FOR WEEKS NOW, THAT I DON'T THINK I'VE SPENT THIS MUCH TIME TALKING ABOUT- NOT ABOUT THE SUBSTANCE AND THE POLICIES, BUT HOW IT'S GOING TO BE RECEIVED AND HOW THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO PERFORM. THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID: WATCH ME, THIS IS GOING TO BE THE BIGGEST AUDIENCE HE HAS UNTIL THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION LATER THIS SUMMER TO REALLY SHOW THE COUNTRY THAT HE'S UP FOR THE JOB. THEY'VE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS. IT'S ALSO INTERESTING THOUGH, BECAUSE LAST YEAR THEY WERE TALKING SO MUCH ABOUT HOW SUCCESSFUL HE WAS WITH THE REPUBLICANS IN THE AUDIENCE. YOU'RE WONDERING IF THEY'RE SETTING EXPECTATIONS TOO HIGH THAT THEY'LL TRY TO MANUFACTURE A MOMENT. IT WORKED BECAUSE IT WAS SPONTANEOUS. >>. THAT'S A FANTASTIC POINT AND WE KNOW STEPHANIE, THERE WILL LIKELY BE A FEW HECKLERS IN THE CROWD. >> I WOULD IMAGINE SO. I WOULD IMAGINE SO. >> HOW IMPORTANT YOU KIND OF HEARD SENATOR BLUMENTHAL TALK ABOUT THIS. THAT AUTHENTICITY FACTOR. IF THERE IS A MANUFACTURED BACK AND FORTH, IT WON'T FEEL THE SAME AS IT FELT LAST YEAR. WHAT DO YOU THINK HE NEEDS TO DO? >> I REALLY HOPE THERE ISN'T SOMETHING BEING MANUFACTURED. I COMPLETELY AGREE. IT'S ALWAYS GOT TO BE AUTHENTIC. THIS IS HIS MOMENT WHERE HE GETS TO BE, JOE BIDEN, IN A CHAMBER HE IS USED TO BEING IN. I MEAN HE IS A CREATURE OF CONGRESS, SO HE'S GOT LOTS OF FRIENDS IN THERE. >> EXCUSE ME, SORRY. >>. WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT THAT. >> ALLERGY SEASON >> IT IS, IT IS EVERYWHERE. BUT I DO THINK THAT YOU KNOW HE IS GOING TO NEED TO PERFORM. IT IS DEFINITELY THE POINT OF CONVERSATION AND I THINK HE'S IN A GOOD PLACE TO DO THAT. BUT, BOY, THE EYES ARE ON HIM. >>. YEAH, THEY SURE ARE JIM. WE KNOW THAT. SPEAKER JOHNSON HAS ADVISED HIS CONFERENCE TO HAVE DECORUM. HE HAS URGED THEM NOT TO INTERRUPT AND INTERJECT. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO BE WATCHING FOR TONIGHT, AND DO YOU THINK THAT COULD WORK AGAINST REPUBLICANS? >>. MARJORIE TAYLOR GREEN HAS ALREADY SAID: DECORUM IS DEAD. I DON'T WANT TO SPECULATE WHAT BOEBERT IS GOING TO DO. LET'S STEP BACK AND SAY: I ACTUALLY DON'T THINK THIS IS AS HUGE A NIGHT AS BLUMENTHAL AND OTHER FOLKS ARE MAKING IT SOUND. IT'S A SPEECH. JOE BIDEN HAS GIVEN A MILLION OF THESE. AS LONG AS HE DOESN'T TRIP ON THE WAY DOWN THE AISLE, DOESN'T LOSE PLACE IN THE TELEPROMPTER OR LOOK AROUND CONFUSED. DELIVERING THE STATE OF THE UNION IS NOT ONE OF THE TOUGHER THINGS TO DO. STICK TO YOUR SCRIPT, SHAKE EVERYBODY'S HAND AND BY THE END OF THE NIGHT EVERYTHING SHOULD BE OKAY. >>. THIS IS AN INFLECTION POINT, AS THE TERM BIDEN LIKES TO USE SO OFTEN, IN THE WAY THAT THE BIDEN TEAM THINKS ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN RIGHT USUALLY. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SET THE AGENDA, TO TALK ABOUT THE POLICIES YOU WANT TO LAY OUT, BUT THE BIDEN TEAM HAS TALKED ABOUT HOW WE THINK ABOUT MARIO M CUOMO. YOU CAMPAIGN IN POETRY. THE MOOD OF THE COUNTRY IS NOW MORE RECEPTIVE TO HEARING THE ARGUMENT OF ONE CANDIDATE FOR ANOTHER. THAT'S REALLY AT THE HEART OF HOW THE CAMPAIGN VIEWS THIS SPEECH. TONIGHT THEY THINK HE'LL TALK ABOUT THE SAME POLICIES. HE'S TALKED ABOUT THE PAST THREE YEARS, BUT VOTERS WILL BE MORE ENGAGED. LET ME THINK ABOUT THIS VERSUS DONALD TRUMP, THE TIMING OF COURSE SO PIVOTAL, COMING TWO DAYS AFTER. SUPER TUESDAY >>. THE GENERAL ELECTION IS UPON US. THIS IS IT. IT IS HAPPENING SO TONIGHT. WHAT I BELIEVE WE'RE GOING TO REALLY HEAR IS THE BEGINNING OF THE CLEAR CONTRAST. THIS ELECTION IS A CHOICE, AND I THINK PRESIDENT BIDEN IS GOING TO LAY OUT THAT CHOICE VERY CLEARLY, NOT JUST IN WHAT HE HAS DONE AND H AND HE HAS DONE SO MUCH FOR THE ECONOMY AND THE COUNTRY BUT ALSO WHAT IS AT STAKE MOVING FORWARD AND WHAT HE NEEDS TO CONTINUE DOING FOR THE WORKING FAMILIES OF THIS COUNTRY. >>. JIM, WE KNOW THAT FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SAID HE'S GOING TO BE ON TRUTH SOCIAL THROUGHOUT. THE NIGHT MAGA INC IS OUT WITH A BLISTERING NEW AD EFFECTIVELY RAISING THE QUESTION: WILL PRESIDENT BIDEN SURVIVE FOR A FULL SECOND TERM? COULD THAT BE TYPE OF TONE, POTENTIALLY BACKFIRE? >>? I THINK THAT'S IN KEEPING WITH THE TRUMP FIRE. HE'S NOT A MAN FOR SUBTLETY OR HINTING OR WINKING OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. THIS IS ONE OF THE SIDE EFFECTS OF PEOPLE BEING CONCERNED ABOUT BIDEN'S AGE. ONE IS HE'S STILL GOING TO BE MENTALLY ALL THERE EVERY TIME HE TRIPS AND FALLS. WE ALL CLUTCH OUR HEARTS AFRAID THIS IS GOING TO BE SOMETHING SERIOUS. IT'S IN THE BACK OF OUR MINDS WHEN YOU COME OUT AND SAY I THINK THE GUY'S GOING TO DIE. THAT IS A LITTLE IN PEOPLE'S FACES AND MIGHT MAKE PEOPLE RECOIL. >>. MIKE, THE CAMPAIGN IS JUST FIRING BACK IN FULL FORCE. >> INVITING THE FORMER PRESIDENT, IF HE WANTS TO, YOU KNOW, SEE HOW THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO PERFORM. WATCH TONIGHT. THE THING I THINK QUIETLY THE BIDEN TEAM IS REALLY LOOKING AT IN THIS MOMENT IS THE ROLE OF THE MEDIA AND THE CAMPAIGN. FRANKLY. TRUMP'S TEAM HAS A BETTER SENSE OF THE MEDIA, MIND THAN THE BIDEN TEAM HAS SHOWN, FRANKLY SPEAKING. IT'S NOT AN ACCIDENT. HOW THEY ROLLED OUT THIS AD THE MORNING OF THE STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS ON SHOWS, LIKE MORNING JOE. IT WAS QUICKLY ON THE NEW YORK TIMES WEBSITE. PLACES WHERE WE IN THE ECHO CHAMBER OF WASHINGTON CONVENTIONAL WISDOM CENTERS. THEY KNEW WE WERE GOING TO SEE THIS AND TALK ABOUT IT ALL DAY. THAT'S WHERE THEY WANT THE CONVERSATION TO BE. THE CHALLENGE FOR THE BIDEN TEAM IS TO PUT IT BACK WHERE THEY WANT IT, WHICH IS ON THE ISSUES. >>. COME OUT AND SAY: NOT DEAD, YET. >>. WELL, SPEAKING OF ANOTHER PERSON, WE'RE GOING TO BE WATCHING CLOSELY TONIGHT. THE REPUBLICAN RESPONSE: BRITZ, WHAT DOES SHE NEED TO DO? >>. THIS POSITION HAS AN ANCIENT GYPSY CURSE ON IT. SENATOR MARCO RUBIO WOULD SAY: STAY HYDRATED. YOU'RE ALONE IN A ROOM, YOU'RE STARING AT A COMPUTER. YOU'RE SAYING: THE PRESIDENT IS WRONG ABOUT THIS AND, SHOCKINGLY, IT'S NOT AS EXCITING AS THE OTHER ONE. >>. AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF FOLKS SHUT IT OFF. THEY DON'T EVEN SEE IT. SO THERE'S THAT. >>. IT'S DEFINITELY GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT IVF, REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS, SOMETHING THAT DEMOCRATS WANT TO OWN. REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING TO TAKE THAT ISSUE BACK. >>. THEY'RE NOT DOING A VERY GOOD JOB AND IT'S ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE AND WORSE. AND YOU HEARD SPEAKER JOHNSON JUST COMPLETELY MAKE A MESS OUT OF IVF- AND HE IS THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. THEY JUST LIKE 195 OF THE HOUSE. REPUBLICANS JUST VOTED AGAINST A CONTRACEPTION BILL. THEY'RE BLOCKING THE REPUBLICANS ARE BLOCKING AN IVF BILL WHILE THE LEGISLATURE OF ALABAMA MOVED ONE THROUGH AND THE GOVERNOR SIGNED IT. SO THIS IS AGAIN. THE REPUBLICANS ARE JUST ON THE WRONG SIDE OF A MAJOR ISSUE, WHICH IS, BY THE WAY, REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM IN ITS ENTIRETY, AND THEY'RE AGAINST THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION. THEY BETTER FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET ON THE CORRECT SIDE. >>. WE'LL HEAR MORE ABOUT REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH FROM THE PRESIDENT. THAN WE'VE HEARD ON THIS STAGE BEFORE LAST YEAR WAS A BRIEF SET OF COMMENTS. THAT WILL BE A MAJOR PART OF HIS SPEECH TONIGHT- HIS SPEECH TONIGHT. IT SPEAKS TO THE LARGER THEME ABOUT FREEDOM. HE'S INVOKE FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT'S ADDRESS, WHERE HE OUTLINED HIS FOUR FREEDOMS. HOW YOU ADAPT THAT TO THE MODERN AGE, MARRYING WHO YOU LOVE, REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM, THE FREEDOM TO VOTE- THIS IS PART OF THE THEMATIC PUSH FROM THE PRESIDENT. >>. YOU ALL SET THE STAGE VERY WELL. WE'LL BE WATCHING IT CLOSELY. THANK YOU FOR A GREAT CONVERSATION. MIKE, STEPHANIE AND JIM REALLY APPRECIATE IT. >>> COMING UP NEXT, WHITE HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR JOINS US AS PRESIDENT BIDEN PREPARES FOR TONIGHT. BUT FIRST, A LOOK BACK AT BARACK OBAMA'S STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS AS HE SOUGHT REELECTION >>. THE STATE OF OUR UNION IS GETTING STRONGER. WE'VE COME TOO FAR TO TURN BACK NOW. AS LONG AS I'M PRESIDENT, I WILL WORK WITH ANYONE IN THIS CHAMBER TO BUILD ON THIS MOMENTUM, BUT I INTEND TO FIGHT OBSTRUCTION WITH ACTION AND I WILL OPPOSE ANY EFFORT TO RETURN TO THE VERY SAME POLICIES THAT BROUGHT ON THIS. >>> WELCOME BACK. >>> WELCOME BACK. WE'RE JUST ABOUT FOUR HOURS AWAY FROM PRESIDENT BIDEN'S STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS. TONIGHT FOR MORE ON WHAT TO EXPECT. I'M JOINED BY WHITE HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR. THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME. >> HAPPY TO BE HERE, KRISTEN. >> SET THE SCENE FOR US. MIKE TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT HE IS GOING TO LAY OUT HIS ARGUMENT THAT, WITH ANOTHER FOUR YEARS, HE WILL PROTECT THE FREEDOMS OF THIS COUNTRY. WHAT SHOULD WE BE WATCHING FOR? >>? THERE'S THREE KEY COMPONENTS TO THE SPEECH DEFENDING INDIVIDUAL LIBERTIES IN THIS COUNTRY THAT HAVE BEEN UNDER ASSAULT FROM MAGA REPUBLICANS. YOU'VE SEEN NOT ONLY CHOICE BUT IVF CONTRACEPTION- A WHOLE HOST OF THINGS UNDER ASSAULT IN ADDITION TO REPUBLICAN LEGISLATURES PASSING SIMILAR LEGISLATION IN STATES. THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO STAND UP FOR WOMEN'S RIGHTS, STAND UP FOR FAMILY'S RIGHT AND FIGHT TO RESTORE ROE VS WADE. HE'S GOING TO STAND UP FOR AND CALL ON AMERICANS TO JOIN HIM, PROTECTING OUR DEMOCRACY. THIS IS A REAL HIGH STAKES MOMENT WHERE DEMOCRACY IS UNDER THREAT. AT HOME AND ABROAD, DONALD TRUMP DEFENDED INSURRECTIONISTS AS PATRIOTS. THE PRESIDENT THINKS OUR DEMOCRACY IS ON THE LINE. FINALLY, HE WANTS TO KEEP THE STRONGEST ECONOMIC RECOVERY IN THE WORLD GOING: 15MILLION JOBS CREATED UNDER THIS PRESIDENT, THE MOST IN HISTORY. INFLATION IS DOWN TWO-THIRDS SINCE LAST SUMMER. WAGES ARE RISING, THE RACIAL WEALTH GAP IS CLOSING AND HE'S GOT SOME CONCRETE PROPOSALS TONIGHT TO CONTINUE TO LOWER COSTS FOR HARD-WORKING AMERICANS >>. HE OBVIOUSLY NOW HAS A PRESUMPTIVE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE. HE'S RUNNING AGAIN FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP. IS HE GOING TO DIRECTLY MENTION TRUMP'S NAME TONIGHT? >> WELL, I DON'T THINK THERE WILL BE ANY MYSTERY ABOUT WHO THE PRESIDENT IS REFERRING TO TONIGHT, BUT A STATE OF THE UNION HAS A FEW GOALS. THE FIRST IS TO LEVEL SET WHERE WE'VE COME OVER THESE PAST FEW YEARS, HOW WE OVERCAME THE PANDEMIC AND THE SUPPLY CHAIN CRISIS AS A RESULT OF THE POLICIES THAT THE PRESIDENT PUT IN PLACE. THAT HAS CAUSED A MANUFACTURING REVIVAL ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND 15 MILLION JOBS. SO THAT WILL BE ONE PIECE OF HIS SPEECH. THE SECOND WILL BE THE PRESIDENT'S FORWARD-LOOKING VISION, IF HE HAS THE CHANCE TO SERVE AGAIN. WE'VE ANNOUNCED PIECES OF THAT TODAY. HE'LL BE TAKING ON THE COST OF MORTGAGES AND PROVIDING RELIEF THERE. FOR EXAMPLE, HEALTHCARE COSTS, INSULIN CAPPED AT $35 FOR SENIORS, PRESCRIPTION DRUGS- $2,000 FOR SENIORS. HE WANTS TO EXPAND THAT TO ALL AMERICANS. HIS SECOND-TERM AGENDA WILL BE PART OF THE SPEECH TONIGHT. BUT HE'LL TALK ABOUT WHAT HE'S FIGHTING AGAINST, AND THAT'S THE ASSAULT ON INDIVIDUAL LIBERTS, ASSAULTS ON REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS AND MORE TAX CUTS FOR BILLIONAIRES AND CORPORATIONS THAT MAGA REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN PROMOTING >>. I HEAR YOU SAYING WE SHOULDN'T EXPECT TO HEAR TRUMP'S NAME BUT PRESIDENT BIDEN'S GOING TO SPEND A GOOD PORTION OF THE EVENING DRAWING THAT CONTRAST >>. I THINK THE CONTRAST AGAINST THE MAGA REPUBLICAN AGENDA WILL CERTAINLY BE PART OF HIS SPEECH TONIGHT. >>. LET ME GET YOUR TAKE ON WHAT WE HEARD FROM SENATOR BLUMENTHAL. WE JUST PLAYED IT. HE TALKED ABOUT THE HIGH STAKES OF TONIGHT. HE SAID QUOTE: WHAT'S AT STAKE IS NOT JUST THE ISSUES HE DISCUSSES BUT THE WAY HE COMES ACROSS. DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT GIVEN THAT POLLS DO SHOW, LIKE IT OR NOT? POLLS SHOW THE VAST MAJORITY OF AMERICANS DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT PRESIDENT BIDEN'S AGE AND FITNESS TO SERVE >>. YOU HEARD THE PRESIDENT ADDRESS THIS LAST WEEK ONSET MEYERS. HE AND DONALD TRUMP ARE ABOUT THE SAME AGE. THE DIFFERENCE IS THE AGE OF THEIR IDEAS. THE FORMER PRESIDENT'S IDEAS ARE FROM 50 YEARS AGO. HE BELIEVES ROE VS WADE SHOULD BE OVERTURNED. HE DID THAT. HE DOESN'T BELIEVE CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL. HE'S COMMITTING THIS ASSAULT ON INDIVIDUAL LIBERTIES. ACROSS THE COUNTRY. PRESIDENT BIDEN WANTS TO LEAD US INTO THE FUTURE. HE MADE THE LARGEST INVESTMENT IN CLIMATE EVER. HE WANTS TO RESTORE ROE VS WADE. I THINK. EVERY DAY AT THE WHITE HOUSE WE SEE THE PRESIDENT GIVE EXTENSIVE SPEECHES AND REMARKS AND TAKE TOUGH QUESTIONS FROM REPORTERS. THE AVERAGE PERSON IN THEIR DAILY LIFE DOESN'T NECESSARILY SEE THAT THEY'RE FOCUSED ON OTHER THINGS. IT'S HARDER TO BREAKTHROUGH IN THIS FRACTURED MEDIA LANDSCAPE. HE'LL HAVE THE LARGEST TELEVISION AUDIENCE HE'LL SEE ALL YEAR TONIGHT. I THINK AMERICANS ACROSS THE COUNTRY WILL HEAR HIS VISION IN A WAY THAT THEY HAVEN'T RECENTLY. >>. ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES LOOMING OVER TONIGHT OBVIOUSLY THE WAR IN THE MIDDLE EAST. IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO ANNOUNCE A NEW MILITARY MISSION TO GET MORE AID INTO GAZA. CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THAT? WILL THAT BE A PART OF HIS SPEECH, BEN. >>. ABSOLUTELY, HE WILL TOUCH ON THAT. TONIGHT, KRISTEN, HE'LL REVISIT THE EVENTS OF OCTOBER 7th AND THE TERRORIST ATTACK THAT WAS COMMITTED AGAINST ISRAEL. HE'LL TALK ABOUT HIS WORK WITH THE ISRAELIS, WITH PARTNERS IN THE REGION, TO MAKE SURE HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE IS GETTING INTO GAZA FOR PALESTINIANS THAT AREN'T PART OF HAMAS AND WHO ARE INNOCENT CIVILIANS THAT HASN'T BEEN HAPPENING AT THE PACE THE PRESIDENT WOULD LIKE TO SEE. LAST WEEK HE STARTED AIR DROPS INTO THE COUNTRY, WORKING WITH THE JORDANIANS, AND TONIGHT HE WILL ANNOUNCE THE NEW MARITIME HUMANITARIAN CORRIDOR WHERE SHIPS, WHICH CAN CARRY MUCH MORE THAN TRUCKS, CAN GET THE LEVEL OF RESOURCES THAT ARE NEEDED INTO GAZA. >>. ALL RIGHT, BEN. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US ON THIS STATE OF THE UNION NIGHT. WE REALLY APPRECIATE ALL OF YOUR INFORMATION AND PERSPECTIVE AND A PROGRAMMING REMINDER. STATE OF THE UNION COVERAGE ON NBC NEWS, NOW BEGINNING AT 8:00 PM EASTERN. WE'LL BE ON THE AIR UNTIL MIDNIGHT WITH ALL OF THE",[52]
248,_f7oORG-RQY,Meet the Press NOW â€” March 5,NBC News,2024-03-05 23:45:00+00:00,">> I AM A LITTLE TIRED OF. >> I AM A LITTLE TIRED OF TRUMP'S DRAMA. >>. WHAT WAS TOP OF MIND WHEN YOU WERE VOTING TODAY? >> OF VOTING FOR TRUMP. >> VOTING FOR JOE BIDEN. >> I DON'T WANT TRUMP TO BE PRESIDENT. I THINK IF HE IS PRESIDENT WE LOSE OUR DEMOCRACY. >>. I AM NOT BIDEN'S BIGGEST FAN BUT I THINK ANYTHING IS BETTER THAN TRUMP OR HALEY. >>. WELCOME TO MEET THE PRESS. AND NOW I AM AT ELECTION HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK WITH OUR THREE FAVORITE WORDS: VOTERS ARE VOTING. IT IS SUPER TUESDAY, THE BIGGEST NIGHT OF THE PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY CALENDAR, WITH REPUBLICAN CONTESTS AND 15 STATES AND DOZENS OF BALLOT RACES ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. MILLIONS OF VOTERS ARE VOTING IN FACT, THE FIRST POLLS IN JUST A FEW HOURS. SO LET'S DIG RIGHT IN TONIGHT. 865 DELEGATES AT STAKE ACROSS THE 15 REPUBLICAN CONTESTS, FROM NAN TO ALASKA. DONALD TRUMP ENTRANCE TONIGHT WITH 276 COMMITTED DELEGATES TO NIKKI. HALEY IS 43.. THE FORMER PRESIDENT SAYS HE IS BANKING ON A BIG NIGHT TO EFFECTIVELY CLOSEOUT THE RACE SO HE CAN FOCUS ON THE GENERAL ELECTION >>. MY FOCUS, REALLY AT THIS POINT IS: I SHOULD WIN ALMOST EVERY STATE TODAY. I THINK, ALMOST EVERY STATEMENT LAST NIGHT. AS YOU KNOW, WE WON WITH 87% OF THE BOATS WE WON NORTH DAKOTA, A GREAT STATE WITH A GREAT GOVERNOR. BY THE WAY, WE ARE REALLY LOOKING AT BIDEN >>. THIS STORY LINE TONIGHT WILL BE THE MARGINS AS THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN TRIES TO FIGURE OUT WHERE HE IS THE STRONGEST AND THE WEAKEST AMONG REPUBLICAN VOTERS, HEADING INTO NOVEMBER. AS FOR NIKKI HALEY, TONIGHT IS SIMPLY PUT DO OR DIE. SHE IS GOING TO HAVE TO OVER PERFORM EXPECTATIONS TO GET BACK IN THIS RACE. SEVERAL STATE REPUBLICAN PARTIES HAVE MADE THEIR BASES: WIN OR TAKE ALL TO MAXIMIZE THE DELEGATES HOLD OF THE FRONT- RUNNER. NIKKI HALEY WILL BE WATCHING HER FRIENDS FROM HER HOME STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA. AFTER GIVING NO INDICATION, SHE IS READY TO GET OUT OF THE RACE. >>. IF I WERE TO GET OUT OF THE RACE, IT WOULD STILL BE THE LONGEST PRESIDENTIAL GENERAL ELECTION IN HISTORY. I DON'T KNOW WHY EVERYONE IS SO ADAMANT. THEY HAVE TO FOLLOW TRUMP'S LEAD TO GET ME OUT OF THIS RACE. ALL OF THESE PEOPLE DESERVE TO VOTE. ECKSTEIN STATES WANT TO HAVE THEIR VOICES HEARD AS MUCH AS EVERYBODY WANTS TO PUSH ME OUT. I AM NOT READY TO GET OUT. YET, I AM STILL THERE FOR THE PEOPLE THAT WANT A VOICE. THEY DESERVE THAT. >>. BE ON THE PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARIES. WE ARE ALSO FOLLOWING A WIDE OPEN AND WIDE SENATE PRIMARY IN CALIFORNIA. THREE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND A FORMER BASEBALL PLAYER- AND WE WILL BE WATCHING PRIMARY CONTESTS IN NORTH CAROLINA ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE. THAT WILL BE WHAT IS EXPECTED TO BE THE GOVERNOR'S RACE THIS NOVEMBER. OUR TEAM IS ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND ALL THE MAJOR CONTESTS TALKING TO VOTERS. LET'S GET RIGHT TO THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. ALLIE VITALE IS IN SOUTH CAROLINA. GARRETT IS IN FLORIDA, WHERE DONALD TRUMP IS HOSTING A SUPER TUESDAY WATCH PARTY GARY IS IN VIRGINIA, WHERE HE HAS BEEN DRIVING ACROSS THE STATE ALL DAY, CHECKING IN AT DIFFERENT POLLING PLACES, AND JACK BREWSTER IS IN SOUTH CAROLINA. ALLIE, I HAVE TO START WITH YOU, AND THE BIGGEST QUESTION OF SUPER TUESDAY IS THIS: NIKKI HALEY'S LAST STAND. TAKE US INSIDE HER CAMPAIGN. WHAT ARE THEY SAYING, HEADING INTO TONIGHT? >>. KRISTIN, YOUR INTERVIEW THIS WEEKEND WITH HALEY WAS ACTUALLY REALLY CONSTRUCTIVE, BECAUSE ONCE AGAIN, SHE MOVED THE GOALPOST WHO ONLY HAS HANGING ON HER. EVERY WORD WOULD ACTUALLY NOTICE. WHEN SHE WAS ASKED BY YOU IF SHE WOULD STAY IN THIS RACE PAST SUPER TUESDAY, SHE SAID SHE WOULD STAY IN THIS RACE FOR AS LONG AS SHE IS COMPETITIVE BID. ALL OF US HAVE GOTTEN TO KNOW THE HALEY CAMPAIGN AT THIS POINT THE WAY. THEY HAVE A VERY SPECIFIC METRIC FOR EXPECTATIONS FOR THEMSELVES ON ELECTION NIGHT. THEY HAVE ONLY USE WORDS LIKE COMPETITIVE, ARE SHOWING AN UPWARD, TRAJECTORY SORT OF DEMANDING HOW THEY ARE GOING TO STAY IN THE RACE, GOING FORWARD. I THINK THAT IS STRIKING, ESPECIALLY AS WE CONSIDER WHAT IS NEXT FOR HALEY AND ONE OF THE QUESTIONS. I ASKED VOTERS IN TEXAS WHERE SHE HELD HER LAST PUBLIC EVENT LAST NIGHT, AND I SAY LAST BECAUSE THERE ARE NO MORE PUBLIC EVENTS ON THE SCHEDULE. WE DON'T EVEN EXPECT TO SEE NIKKI HALEY THIS EVENING. I AM TOLD SHE IS GOING TO BE TAKEN IN THE RESULTS HERE IN THE CHARLESTON AREA. I ASKED VOTERS WHAT HAPPENS IF HALEY DROPPED OUT AND WHAT HAPPENS IF SHE ENDORSES TRUMP. WATCH, IF SHE WERE TO DROP OUT. WHAT YOU BE DISAPPOINTED IF SHE ENDORSED TRUMP >> YES >>, WOULD YOU. >>, WOULD YOU >>. YOU KNOW, NOBODY IS PERFECT, CERTAINLY NOT MR TRUMP, AND SO I MAKE UP MY MIND ABOUT WHO IS GOING TO TAKE CARE OF HER OUR COUNTRY. I DON'T KNOW, YET. >>. AND KRISTIN EVEN THOSE VOTERS THERE WHO SAID THEY WERE EITHER OPEN TO TRUMP OR WOULD STICK WITH TRUMP IN THE GENERAL ELECTION EVEN, THEY WERE CRITICAL OF HIM AND THEY WERE AT A NIKKI HALEY EVENT ON THE NIGHT BEFORE SUPER TUESDAY >>. SO CONSTRUCTIVE, GREAT INTERVIEWS. ALLIE, TELL ME ABOUT THE MATH AND THE MAP. WHAT RACES AND WHAT STATES DOES THE HALEY CAMPAIGN FEEL MOST CONFIDENT? THEY CAN POTENTIALLY PICK UP- I KNOW THEY ARE IMED STATES LIKE VERMONT AND MASSACHUSETTS >> VERMONT, MASSACHUSETTS, EVEN PLACES LIKE VIRGINIA- THINK ABOUT ANYWHERE ON THIS MAP WHERE THE WIN OR TAKE, ALL THRESHOLDS ARE LITTLE, LOWER BUT ALSO PLACES WHERE THERE ARE OPEN PRIMARIES. PLACES WHERE DEMOCRATS CAN EFFECTIVELY DABBLE IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY RACE. I KNOW GARY IS IN VIRGINIA. I HEARD FROM ONE ELECTED OFFICIAL THERE SAID: HEY, I AM SEEING SOME NEW THINGS IN MY TEXT MESSAGES: PEOPLE WHO DON'T OFTEN VOTE IN PRIMARIES AND PEOPLE WHO ARE DEMOCRATS SAYING: I NEED TO GET OUT AND VOTE FOR NIKKI HALEY AS A CHANCE TO GET RID OF DONALD TRUMP FROM THE BALLOT. WE WILL HAVE TO SEE IF THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF PEOPLE THAT CAME OUT TO MAKE A STRONG SHOWING IN STATES LIKE THESE. BUT AS MUCH AS VOTER CONVERSATIONS ARE CONSTRUCTED, WE ARE ALSO LOOKING AHEAD. SARAH DN CALLING AROUND TO. SOME OF THE FOLKS ON THE GROUND IN CALIFORNIA HAVE ENDORSED HALEY'S CAMPAIGN. THEY TELL US THAT THERE ARE NO PLANS FOR ANY EVENTS THERE. IT DOESN'T MEAN I CAN'T CHANGE, BUT AT THIS POINT THERE ARE NO PLANS FOR HER TO GET ON THE GROUND >>. YOU AND I DO A LOT OF TEA LEAF READING AT THIS POINT IN ANY RACE ALLIE, AND THAT CERTAINLY IS A BIG ONE. YOU HAVE BEEN ALL OVER IT- PHENOMENAL JOB AND GREAT INTERVIEWS WITH THE VOTERS THERE ALLIE VITALE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I WAS THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN FEELING HEADING INTO TONIGHT >>. I JUST INTERVIEWED A SENIOR ADVISER OF DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN WHO EXPRESSED NOTHING BUT CONFIDENCE AND THEY EXPECT THEY WILL SLEEP EVERY STAY ON THE BOARD FOR REPUBLICAN VOTERS TONIGHT. TRUMP CAMPAIGN UNDERSTANDS THEY CANNOT WIN THE NOMINATION OUTRIGHT TONIGHT. THEY THINK THAT WILL PROBABLY TAKE, UNTIL MARCH 19th, TWO MORE SETS OF PRIMARIES TO GET THEM OVER THE THRESHOLD TO BECOME THE PRESUMPTIVE NOMINEE IN TERMS OF DELEGATES. THEY ARE BASICALLY WAITING TO SEE WHEN NIKKI HALEY WILL SEE THE WRITING ON THE WALL THAT THEY BELIEVE SHE HAS ABSOLUTELY NO MATHEMATICAL PATH TO VICTORY. I ASKED ABOUT WORST-CASE SCENARIO AND WAS TOLD: THERE IS NO WORST-CASE SCENARIO BECAUSE SHE CANNOT COME BACK TO BE THE NOMINEE. IT IS REALLY A QUESTION OF WHEN, NOT IF FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE. AFTER THAT, IT IS REALLY THE QUESTION OF WHAT DO I WANT TO DO IN THE GENERAL ELECTION? THE WORD FROM THE SENIOR ADVISER- THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN SAYS ADVISER. THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN SAYS IT LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE IT DOES RIGHT NOW. THE FORMULA THEY PUT TOGETHER, INCLUDING THE FOCUS ON DONALD TRUMP'S LEGAL EXPOSURE- THE CRIMINAL CASE AGAINST HIM, IS A FORMULA THAT WILL CONTINUE TO WORK FOR THEM IN THE GENERAL ELECTION, AND THEY BELIEVE. EVEN THE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATA BACKS IT UP: ALL THE POLLS WE SAW OVER THE LAST COUPLE DAYS SHOWING DONALD TRUMP LEADING JOE BIDEN- YES, WITHIN THE MARGIN OF ERROR BUT LEADING THEM ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THEY BELIEVE IN THE POTENCY OF THE IMMIGRATION ISSUE AND THEY BELIEVE THERE IS VERY LITTLE BIDEN OR ANYONE ELSE CAN DO TO TURN THAT AROUND ON DONALD TRUMP TRYING TO REMAIN DISCIPLINED, AS THEY HAVE BEEN RIGHT NOW, MOSTLY FOCUSED ON JOE BIDEN, NOT TERRIBLY DRIED DOWN BY NIKKI HALEY AND STARTING TO KIND OF SCALE UP AND BUILD OUT THE GENERAL ELECTION. I THINK THE KEY THING TO WATCH, ACCORDING TO THIS ADVISER, IS GOING TO BE: CAN THEY RAISE THE MONEY THEY WILL NEED TO BE COMPETITIVE IN THE COURTROOM ON THE BALLOT. ACROSS THE COUNTRY WITH THE EXPECTATION THEY WILL BE FACING A BILLION- DOLLAR MONEY MACHINE FROM BIDEN'S CAMPAIGN AND AN AFFILIATED SUPER PAC. THOSE ARE THE CONVERSATIONS BEING MADE AT MAR-A-LAGO, OVER MY SHOULDER EVEN TODAY, AS THEY START TO THINK ABOUT WHAT LIFE LOOKS LIKE AFTER SUPER TUESDAY AND AFTER THE PRIMARY IS IN THE REARVIEW. MIRROR, KRISTIN. >>. THANK YOU SO MUCH. LET'S TURN OUT TO GARY. YOU HAVE BEEN DRIVING ALL OVER THE COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA TODAY. STILL IN THE CAR, GONE DEMOCRATIC IN THE LAST FEW PRESIDENTIAL RACES. NIKKI HALEY HAS BEEN MAKING HER PITCH TO VOTERS IN VIRGINIA. WHAT ARE YOU HEARING WHEN YOU TALK TO VOTERS? >> WE HAVE BEEN ALL OVER, KRISTIN. WE STARTED IN RICHMOND AND WE MOVED TO A MORE REPUBLICAN AREA. WE NOW HEAD INTO FAIRFAX COUNTY, A SUBURB OF WASHINGTON DC PRETTY HEAVILY DEMOCRATIC. WHAT WE ARE HEARING IN ALL THREE PLACES IS THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS OPEN PRIMARY SYSTEM FOR SOMEBODY LIKE NIKKI HALEY, BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A REGISTERED REPUBLICAN TO VOTE IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY. SO YOU ARE SEEING A LOT OF UNHAPPINESS WITH THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, A LOT OF UNHAPPINESS WITH JOE BIDEN, AND YOU ARE SEEING DEMOCRATS TALKING TO US. THEY ARE NOW SUPPORTING SOMEBODY LIKE NIKKI HALEY, BECAUSE IT IS NOT A PRO NIKKI HALEY VOTE BUT AN ANTI-DONALD TRUMP VOTE. HERE'S WHAT SOME VOTERS WE TALKED TO HAD TO SAY: >> YEAH, AND I WOULD VOTE FOR HIM AGAIN, ABSOLUTELY. IF A DEMOCRAT CANDIDATE COMES ALONG WITH BETTER POLICY ON BETTER IDEAS, I WOULD VOTE FOR HIM ABSOLUTELY. >>. I FELT IT WOULD BE A THROWAWAY VOTE TO VOTE FOR MR BIDEN. I WILL BE THINKING OBVIOUSLY, QUITE, SERIOUSLY, AND NOVEMBER WHAT TO DO. I WOULD HAVE HOPED THAT MY PARTY, THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, WOULD THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, WOULD HAVE FOUND SOMEONE WITH -- WITH ENERGY AND INTEGRITY TO GO FORWARD FOR THIS COUNTRY >>. NOW WE HAVE SEEN DONALD TRUMP HERE IN RICHMOND, VIRGINIA, OVER THE WEEKEND. WE SAW NIKKI HALEY OVER THE WEEKEND. WHAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN ARE THE SURROGATES AND THE REAL GET OUT TO VOTE CAMPAIGN THAT EXISTED JUST LAST YEAR IN THE 2023 STATEWIDE ELECTIONS HERE IN VIRGINIA, GLENN YOUNGKIN AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAD THIS MASSIVE, WELL-FUNDED GET OUT TO VOTE CAMPAIGN CALLED SECURE YOUR VOTE. THAT IS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND AT THIS TIME AROUND KRISTIN >>. FASCINATING STUFF, AND YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. I CAUGHT UP WITH NIKKI HALEY AT ONE OF HER EVENTS THERE IN VIRGINIA AND SHE CERTAINLY IS MAKING A STRONG PUSH THERE. GREAT INTERVIEW. THE VOTERS REALLY APPRECIATE IT. APPRECIATE YOUR VOTING. LET'S TURN NOW TO CHAPA. BREWSTER, NORTH CAROLINA, IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT STATE BECAUSE IT IS GOING TO TELL US A LOT ABOUT THE GENERAL ELECTION. AS WELL, A HUGE BATTLEGROUND, IT IS GOING TO BE A HARD-FOUGHT RACE IN THE GENERAL. GENERAL TRUMP WON IT IN 2020, PRESIDENT BIDEN WANTS TO WIN IT BACK. HE IS SHOWING SIGNS IN SOME OF THE OTHER KEY BATTLEGROUNDS HE WAS ABLE TO WIN IN 2020.. WHAT ARE YOU HEARING FROM VOTERS? >>. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PRESIDENTIAL LEVEL, ESPECIALLY ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE OF THIS KRISTIN, ONE THING YOU DO SEE AND HEAR IS VOTERS UNDERSTAND THE UPHILL BATTLE. NIKKI HALEY IS FACING IN THIS RACE. FOR SOME OF THEM, THAT WAS DRIVING THEM OUT TO THE POLLS. WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THAT IS? NORTH CAROLINA IS A STATE IN WHICH NIKKI HALEY COULD LATE SOME DELEGATES, EVEN IF SHE LOSES BY A LARGE MARGIN, AS LONG AS SHE HEADS THAT 20% DELEGATE THRESHOLD. I WANT YOU TO LISTEN TO WHAT SOME VOTERS HAVE BEEN TELLING ME TODAY, AS I HAVE BEEN HEADING OUT OF THE POLLS AT THE PRESIDENTIAL LEVEL. WHO DID YOU VOTE FOR? >> NIKKI HALEY. >>. WHY NIKKI HALEY? >> I THINK SHE IS A REAL FIGHTER AND YOU KNOW I VOTED FOR TRUMP BEFORE. I THINK HE DID A LOT OF GOOD THINGS. JUST PERSONALITY -- RUBS ME THE WRONG WAY. I AM REALLY HOPING FOR HER. >>. WHO DID YOU SUPPORT FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY TODAY? >> TRUMP. >>. WHY DONALD TRUMP? >>. WHY DONALD TRUMP? >> HE KNOWS WHERE HE STANDS, HE BACKS UP WHAT HE SAYS >> AND THE THING IS ON PAPER. NORTH CAROLINA LOOKS LIKE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR NIKKI HALEY, OR AT LEAST COULD BE UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES. SHE WAS A FORMER GOVERNOR OF A NEIGHBORING STATE. IT'S A STATE WITH A DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR, SO YOU KNOW IF THERE ARE MORE MODERATE VOTERS HERE. THE QUESTION IS WHETHER OR NOT THOSE VOTERS SHOW UP, AND IF THEY SHOW OUT FOR NIKKI HALEY TONIGHT, >> YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. SHAQ BREWSTER, SHE HAS TO SHOW SIGNS OF STRENGTH IN STATES LIKE NORTH CAROLINA, VERMONT, VIRGINIA, THESE STATES THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IN ORDER TO MAKE A REAL CASE OF HER SUPPORTERS AND HER DONORS. MOST IMPORTANTLY, BEFORE I LET YOU GO, THERE IS OBVIOUSLY A HOTLY CONTESTED GUBERNATORIAL RACE. TELL US WHAT YOU CAN ABOUT THAT >>. YEAH, THIS IS A BIG THING. LOOKING AHEAD TO THIS GENERAL ELECTION BECAUSE IN NOVEMBER, NORTH CAROLINA IS EXPECTED TO HAVE ONE OF THE MOST COMPETITIVE GUBERNATORIAL RACES IN THE COUNTRY. SO TODAY IS WHEN EACH PARTY IS DECIDING WHICH CANDIDATE THEY WANT TO PUT UP. THE FRONT RUNNER ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE. YOU ARE LOOKING AT HIM. ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE SCREEN, JOHN STEIN. HE HAS THE ENDORSEMENT OF THE TERM LIMITED POPULAR DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE, REPUBLICANS SEE SOME OPPORTUNITY. THEY HAVE HAD CONTROL SINCE 2016.. DONALD TRUMP HAS PUT HIS THUMB ON THE SCALE SO TO SPEAK, AND ENDORSED THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR, MARK ROBINSON. THE PROBLEM WITH HIM? HE IS OUTSPOKEN AND VERY CRITICAL. THE QUESTION IS: IS HE THE BEST GENERAL ELECTION CANDIDATE? >>? OF COURSE, PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS PRAISING HIM JUST OVER THE WEEKEND. SHAQ BREWSTER, GREAT REPORTING ON THE GROUND FROM NORTH CAROLINA. THANK YOU FOR BEING THERE FOR US. WE WILL SEE LATER FOR TONIGHT'S SPECIAL COVERAGE. NEW MARKET COMING UP. BREAKING NEWS FROM CAPITOL HILL, WHERE SENATOR KYRSTEN SINEMA OF BATTLEGROUND STATE ARIZONA HAS ANNOUNCED SHE WILL NOT BE SEEKING RE-ELECTION >>> UP NEXT SUPERSIZED MOVEMENT FOR STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS IN JUST A FEW DAYS AND BIDEN IS STRUGGLING IN. THE NEWS FOR THE GENERATION OF NOW IS NBC NEWS. NOW IS NBC NEWS NOW >>. [ MUSIC ] >>> WELCOME BACK. IT IS NOT JUST REPUBLICANS CASTING BALLOTS. TODAY, DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY VOTERS ARE HEADING TO THE POLLS IN 15 STATES, PLUS AMERICAN SAMOA. PRESIDENT BIDEN ISN'T EXPECTED TO FACE MUCH RESISTANCE BUT RIGHT NOW THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN KNOWS IT HAS A LOT OF WORK TO DO. HEADING INTO NOVEMBER [ DO HEADING INTO NOVEMBER? [ INDISCERNIBLE ] SPEAKING OF WHICH? IN A RADIO INTERVIEW THAT AIRED IN DALLAS, TEXAS, THIS MORNING, THE PRESIDENT TRIED TO TOUT HIS ADMINISTRATION'S EFFORTS TO HELP AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITIES. HE ALSO LAID OUT WHAT HE BELIEVES IS AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION. TAKE A LISTEN. >>. SO MUCH AT STAKE [ INDISCERNIBLE ]. IF WE LOSE THIS ELECTION, YOU ARE GOING TO BE BACK WITH DONALD TRUMP AND DONALD TRUMP -- THE WAY HE TALKS, THE WAY HE ACTED- [ INDISCERNIBLE ]. >>. JOINING ME NOW IS DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN FROM CALIFORNIA AND MEMBER OF THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN ADVISORY BOARD. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME. REALLY APPRECIATE IT. >>. THANKS FOR HAVING ME ON, KRISTIN. >>. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE STATE OF PLAY. HEADING INTO SUPER TUESDAY, THE LATEST POLLS SHOW, PRESIDENT BIDEN TRAILING FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP WITHIN THE MARGIN OF ERROR AS WE START TO PIVOT TO THE GENERAL ELECTION. DO YOU THINK THAT THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN, THAT HIS TEAM, IS SHOWING ANOTHER URGENCY IN THE FACE OF THESE POLLS AND, FRANKLY, OTHER DISCONTENT THAT WE ARE HEARING FROM VOTERS? >>. I REALLY DO. I KNOW WE ARE STARTING TO PUT TOGETHER THE CAMPAIGN TEAM, BUILDING UP AN INFRASTRUCTURE IN THIS CRITICAL STATES. YOU KNOW IT'S MARCH AND THE ELECTION IS NOT UNTIL NOVEMBER BUT YOU ARE BUILDING THAT INFRASTRUCTURE AND THEY WILL MAKE THE CASE WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO AN ELECTION. THAT IS REALLY A BINARY CHOICE BETWEEN A PRESIDENT WHO ENDED THE PANDEMIC, HELPED US, HAVE THE STRONGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD AND IS HOLDING THIS WORLD TOGETHER WITH THE WAR IN EUROPE, TRYING TO END THE WAR IN THE MIDDLE EAST, AND THE PRESIDENT [ INDISCERNIBLE ] >>. LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT SOME OF THE NUMBERS MORE SPECIFICALLY. THE LATEST NEW YORK TIMES, SIENA COLLEGE POLL SHOWS THAT 61% OF BIDEN VOTERS FEEL LIKE THE PRESIDENT IS TOO OLD TO BE AN EFFECTIVE LEADER. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THOSE TYPES OF NUMBERS AND YOU THINK THE PRESIDENT IS DOING ENOUGH TO DISPEL THOSE CONCERNS? IS HE OUT FRONT, ENOUGH, IN OTHER WORDS? >>. I THINK YOU WILL SEE A LOT MORE OF THE PRESIDENT RIGHT NOW. THIS IS THE HARDEST JOB IN THE WORLD: A WAR IN EUROPE WHERE YOU ARE TRYING TO DEFEAT VLADIMIR PUTIN, TRYING TO PREVENT A WAR IN ASIA, THE CONFLICT IN THE MIDDLE EAST. THAT ALL FALLS ON THE PRESIDENT. SO HE HAS BEEN VERY BUSY BUT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL, TALKING TO THE VOTERS, ALL OF US OUT THERE. I THINK PEOPLE WILL UNDERSTAND WHAT WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED IN THESE LAST THREE YEARS. >>. LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT SOME OF THE LAST ELECTION RESULTS. MICHIGAN OBVIOUSLY HAD A VERY COORDINATED, UNCOMMITTED VOTE. THEY ARE GOING TO SEND TO. THEY ARE GOING TO SEND TO DELEGATES TONIGHT. UNCOMMITTED IS ON THE BALLOT IN SEVEN STATES. IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING. IT IS NOT QUITE AS ORGANIZED AN EFFORT, AS WE SAW IN MICHIGAN STILL. HOW DO YOU VIEW THIS? DO YOU THINK THIS IS A WARNING SIGN? WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO BE WATCHING FOR? >>. WELL, CERTAINLY, WHAT WE ARE SEEING IN THE MIDDLE EAST, IN GAZA, IS TRAGIC, WITH FOLKS THAT ARE LACKING FOOD, WATER, THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS UNFOLDING AGAIN. THE PRESIDENT IS WORKING OVERTIME. THEY MADE THE CASE YESTERDAY. LET'S GET A TEMPORARY CEASE-FIRE TO OPEN P NEGOTIATIONS. GET NEEDED SUPPLIES IN THERE AND AGAIN SUPPLIES IN THERE AND AGAIN. HOPEFULLY, WE CAN SPEAK TO THE CONSTITUENTS THAT ARE UPSET ABOUT WHAT THEY ARE SEEN IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND BRING THOSE CONSTITUENTS BACK >>. SPEAKING OF THE VICE PRESIDENT, NBC NEWS HAS NO REPORTING THAT OFFICIALS WITH THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL ACTUALLY TONED DOWN. VICE PRESIDENT HARRISES LANGUAGE FOR HER SPEECH IN SELMA, WHERE SHE CALLS FOR AN IMMEDIATE CEASE FIRE. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT? WAS THAT A MISTAKE? WHAT YOU HAVE LIKED TO HER? THAT MORE FIERY, FORCEFUL LANGUAGE, MORE FIERY, FORCEFUL LANGUAGE. >>. I KNOW WE ARE WORKING HARD TO GET A FOUR TO SIX WEEKS CEASE-FIRE SO YOU CAN GET NECESSARY FOOD, MEDICATION, WATER AND AVERT THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS AND, HOPEFULLY, EVEN NEGOTIATE A MUCH LONGER CEASE-FIRE AGAIN. I THINK THE VICE PRESIDENT SAID WHAT A LOT OF US FEEL. LET'S FIND A WAY TO MAKE SURE THE PEOPLE FEEL SECURE BUT LET'S ALSO AVERT THIS CRISIS. >>. DO YOU WISH THAT THE LANGUAGE IN HER SPEECH HADN'T BEEN TONED DOWN? >>. I AM NOT GOING TO SPECULATE ON WHAT HAPPENED. I THOUGHT SHE GAVE A PRETTY POWERFUL SPEECH, WHAT A LOT OF US ARE THINKING. >>. SPEAKING OF SPEECHES, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE BIG ONE COMING UP ON THURSDAY NIGHT. THE STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS. IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN IS GOING TO FRAME THIS AS A CHOICE. WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON? HE IS EXPECTED TO SAY WHAT DOES PRESIDENT BIDEN NEED TO DO IN ORDER TO HAVE AN EFFECTIVE NIGHT ON THURSDAY NIGHT? WHAT DO YOU WANT TO HEAR FROM HIM? >>. THIS ELECTION REALLY IS A CHOICE OF TWO DIFFERENT VISIONS OF AMERICA. JOE BIDEN'S VISION: HE IS GOING TO LAY OUT THAT CASE. THEN THE ALTERNATIVE IS DONALD TRUMP AND THE CHAOS AND HAVOC THAT HIS ADMINISTRATION READS WHEN HE WAS PRESIDENT. SO I THINK HE WILL LAY OUT THAT CASE. HE WILL SPEAK DIRECTLY TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. I THINK HE WILL LAY OUT THE CASE OF WHAT A SECOND BIDEN TERM LOOKS LIKE AND, AGAIN, ELECTIONS ARE ABOUT CHOICES AND HE HAS A CLEAR VISION OF WHAT HE HAS ACCOMPLISHED AND WHERE WE WANT TO GO [ INDISCERNIBLE ]. >>. BEFORE I LET YOU GO, LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT THE SENATE SEAT IN YOUR HOME STATE. YOU HAVE INTEREST CONGRESSMAN ADAM SCHIFF, AND YOU KNOW HE HAS COME UNDER SOME SCRUTINY FOR APPARENTLY TRYING TO BOOST THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE, STEVE. ARE YOU COMFORTABLE WITH THAT TACTIC? >>. ADAM SCHIFF IS A FRIEND, KATIE PORTER IS A FRIEND, BARBARA IS A FRIEND. THEY'RE ALL VERY GOOD SENATORS. I ENDORSED ADAM BECAUSE I THINK, AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME, WITH THE NATIONAL SECURITY SITUATION, THE FORMER CHAIR OF THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE, I THINK HE WOULD BE A GREAT SENATOR FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND GREAT SERVANT TO THIS GREAT NATION. >>. DO YOU HAVE ANY CONCERNS ABOUT HIM BOOSTING STEVE GARVEY? DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT TACTIC OR DOES IT GO TOO FAR? >>. IT IS ALL ABOUT WINNING ELECTIONS AND I THINK ADAM IS RUNNING A VERY STRONG RACE. HE HAS RAISED A LOT OF RESOURCES. HE WAS IN SACRAMENTO THIS PAST WEEKEND CAMPAIGNING. HE HAS BEEN UP AND DOWN THE STATE. I DON'T THINK HE HAS TO DO THAT BUT, AGAIN, I THINK HE WILL BE FINE. >>. CONGRESSMAN, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME ON THIS SUPER TUESDAY. REALLY GOOD TO SEE YOU. >>. THANKS, SEE YOU ALL. >>>. WE WANT TO TURN NOW TO SOME BREAKING NEWS FROM CAPITOL HILL AND A MAJOR SHAKEUP IN A KEY BATTLEGROUND SENATE RACE ARIZONA. SENATOR KYRSTEN SINEMA, AN INDEPENDENT WHO CAUCUSES WITH THE DEMOCRATS, JUST ANNOUNCED A SHORT TIME AGO THAT SHE IS NOT RUNNING FOR RE- ELECTION IN A BLISTERING VIDEO BLAMING THE CURRENT, TOXIC POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT. NBC NEWS CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT JULIE JOINS ME NOW. SHE HAS INTERVIEWED THE SENATOR NOT TOO LONG AGO WHEN SHE WAS TRYING TO GET A DEAL DONE ON PHOTO SECURITY. JULIE TALK ABOUT THIS. HOW MUCH OF A SURPRISE WAS SENATOR. MUCH OF A SURPRISE WAS SENATOR CINEMA'S ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY >>. IT CERTAINLY WAS A SURPRISE TO THOSE IN THE BUILDING, BUT NOT REALLY A SURPRISE TO THOSE OF US WHO HAVE BEEN COVERING HER ESPECIALLY IN HER LATEST EFFORTS TO SECURE THAT BIPARTISAN BORDER BILL. AS YOU HAVE MENTIONED, WE INTERVIEWED HER. WE HAVE BEEN OUTSIDE OF THE ROOM WATCHING HER CRAFT THIS DEAL I HAVE HEARD FROM SOURCES IN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS AFTER THAT BILL ADVANCED THROUGH THE SENATE. THAT WAS SOMETHING SHE WAS REALLY GOING TO USE AS A BOOSTER, AS A LAUNCHING POINT TO SEEK RE-ELECTION IN A STATE WHERE HER SUPPORT AMONGST DEMOCRATS, AMONG THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, HAS CERTAINLY WANED. AFTER SHE PROTECTED THE FILIBUSTER. AFTER SHE SUPPORTED MANY BIPARTISAN EFFORTS, MANY TO THE CONTRARY OF WHAT DEMOCRATS WANTED IN HER HOME STATE. HERE IS WHAT SHE SAID IN A VIDEO TODAY THAT SHE POSTED ON SOCIAL MEDIA ANNOUNCING WHY SHE HAS CHOSEN TO STEP DOWN AFTER TWO DECADES IN POLITICS. WATCH THIS. >> [ INDISCERNIBLE ]. ATTACKING YOUR OPPONENTS ON CABLE NEWS AND SOCIAL MEDIA: COMPROMISE- IT'S A DIRTY WORD. [ INDISCERNIBLE ]. WE CHOSE ANGER AND DIVISION. I BELIEVE IN MY APPROACH BUT IT IS NOT WHAT AMERICA WANTS RIGHT NOW. WANTS RIGHT NOW. >>. CERTAINLY, SHE HAS CREDITED HER WORK ACROSS THE AISLE. ACCREDITED REPUBLICANS SHE HAS WORKED WITH- AND I SHOULD NOTE, SHE WAS THE FIRST DEMOCRAT TO WIN THAT SENATE SEAT IN ARIZONA BEFORE BECOMING AN INDEPENDENT LAST YEAR. >>. REALLY SIGNIFICANT SHAKEUP, JULIE. HOW DOES THIS IMPACT THE SENATE RACE THAT IS UNDERWAY IN ARIZONA? >>. IT IMPACTS IT IN A VERY BIG WAY. YOU ALREADY SAW OUT OF THE GATE LEADER SCHUMER HAD ANNOUNCED HIS ENDORSEMENT OF GALLEGOS, A CONGRESSMAN IN ARIZONA REPRESENTING THE PHOENIX AREA, NOW VYING FOR RE ELECTION TO SEE THAT DEMOCRATIC SENATOR WHO TAKES OVER THE SPOT. I ALSO JUST SPOKE TO KARI LAKE ON CAPITOL HILL, TRYING TO DRUM UP SUPPORT, TRYING TO SEAL THOSE ENDORSEMENTS. SHE IS HERE FOR A DONOR EVENT TOMORROW. SHE HAD SOME KIND WORDS FOR KYRSTEN SINEMA BUT ALSO HAD SOME CHOICE WORDS FOR HER OPPONENTS, FOR BY THEN, KARI LAKE HAS CHANGED HER TUNE AND SHE TOLD ME SHE IS EXPECTING SOME HIGH-PROFILE ENDORSEMENTS IN THE COMING DAYS AND WEEKS. >>. JULIE, THANK YOU SO MUCH AS ALWAYS APPRECIATE IT GREAT TO SEE YOU COMING UP AFTER THE BREAK. WE ARE ON THE GROUND IN ALABAMA WHERE VOTERS ARE VOTING FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE STATE. >> THE FIRST WOMAN ON A LUNAR MISSION. >> MORNING NEWS, NOW STREAMING WEEKDAYS AT 7:00.. >>> WELCOME. BACK. TURNING NOW TO ALABAMA, WHERE WE ARE WATCHING DOWN BALLOT DRAMA. PRIMARY DAY COMES AS WE CONTINUE TO TRACK THE FALLOUT FROM LAST MONTH'S SUPREME COURT RULING THAT FROZEN EMBRYOS ARE CHILDREN. NOW THE DECISION HAS TURNED IVF ACCESS IN THE STATE INTO QUESTION AND CREATED A POLITICAL HEADACHE FOR REPUBLICANS NATIONWIDE ON THE ISSUE OF REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS. TODAY, FIVE OF THE NINE SEATS ON THE SUPREME COURT ARE ON THE BALLOT, INCLUDING THE SPOT OF CHIEF JUSTICE, ALSO SHAKING THINGS UP AN OVERHAUL CONGRESSIONAL MAP. THANKS TO A RULING LATE LAST YEAR. JOINING ME NOW IS A DOSHA BRANDS IN MONTGOMERY, ALABAMA. GOOD TO SEE YOU. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. TRUMP IS EXPECTED TO DOMINATE THE PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY TONIGHT IN ALABAMA. BUT HOW HAS THE RECENT SUPREME COURT RULING IMPACTING THINGS, IF AT ALL? WHAT ARE VOTERS TELLING YOU? >> LOOK, IT HAS CERTAINLY THROWN A SPOTLIGHT ON JUST HOW MUCH POWER STATE SUPREME COURT HAS AND GIVEN. TODAY, FIVE OF THE NINE STATE SUPREME COURT SEATS ARE ON THE BALLOT, KRISTIN, AND THIS IS TOP OF MIND FOR FOLKS. IVF IS OVERWHELMINGLY POPULAR FOR DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS BUT I WILL TELL YOU THIS IS A DEEP RED STATE WITH DEEPLY RELIGIOUS VOTERS, AND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KIND OF ACROSS THE MAP ON THIS ISSUE. TAKE A LISTEN: >> [ INDISCERNIBLE ] >> YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. I HAVE FRIENDS THAT HAVE THEIR. I HAVE FRIENDS THAT HAVE THEIR CHILDREN BY THAT PROCESS. I AM VERY PROTECTIVE OF EMBRYOS >>. SO THE RULING THAT EMBRYOS, OUR CHILDREN, SOMETHING YOU AGREE WITH >> YES >>. I THINK WOMEN OR FAMILIES SHOULD HAVE CONTROL OF THEIR LIVES AND THEIR BODIES, WOMEN IN PARTICULAR. I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE MAKING THOSE DECISIONS HAVE NOT CONSIDERED WHY PEOPLE WANT TO GO THROUGH ALL OF THAT EXPENSE HEARTACHE TO HAVE CHILDREN >>. HERE'S THE THING, KRISTIN, WHAT I HAVE BEEN LEARNING FROM THE FOLKS I HAVE BEEN TALKING TO. THOUGH IS THERE ISN'T A VERY CLEAR CONNECTION FOR A LOT OF VOTERS? BUT WE NOT SUPREME COURT RULING SAYING EMBRYOS, OUR CHILDREN AND THE IMPACT ON IVF IN THIS STATE. THERE MAY BE PEOPLE WHO SAY I AGREE WITH WHAT THE SUPREME COURT DID, I DO THINK LIFE BEGINS AT CONCEPTION EMBRYOS- OUR CHILDREN BUT WHO ALSO SUPPORT IVF? FOR DEMOCRATS, ESPECIALLY WHO ARE TRYING TO USE THE ISSUE OF REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM FOR RALLYING VOTERS, WE REALLY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO DO SOME WORK TO MAKE SURE VOTERS ARE UNDERSTANDING HOW ALL OF THESE THINGS CONNECT, BECAUSE THIS ISSUE IS NOT SUPER STRAIGHTFORWARD ON ITS FACE, KRISTIN >>. IT IS INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED FOR US -- HELPING US UNDERSTAND WHERE EVERYONE STANDS. APPRECIATE IT. DASHA BURNS >>>. WE MAP OUT THE BIG NIGHT AHEAD FROM THE BIG BOARD AND, AS WE HAD TO BREAK, WE HAVE A LIVE LOOK AT THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS AT WORK IN VERMONT, AS A VOTERS CAST THEIR BALLOTS IN >> [ MUSIC ] >> [ MUSIC ] >>> AND WELCOME BACK. IT IS SUPER TUESDAY. I WANT TO BRING IN OUR GREAT PANEL CORNELL, DEMOCRATIC POLLSTER AND NBC 10 POLITICAL ANALYST AND MARK AMERICA FIRST INSTITUTE AND FORMER SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO PRESIDENT TRUMP. CORNELL, LET'S START THINGS OFF WITH YOU, MY FRIEND. WHAT ARE YOU WATCHING FOR TONIGHT? >>. THE THING I AM WATCHING FOR TONIGHT IS NIKKI HALEY. HASN'T BEEN DOING A LOT OF BROADCASTS? ALL THE RECORDS SHOW THEY PULLED BACK FROM DOING A LOT OF TELEVISION. IT IS INTERESTING TO STILL SEE WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE BOAT IS ALMOST A PROTEST VOTE. DOES SHE GET 25TO 27% OF THE VOTE? DOES SHE GET CLOSE TO A THIRD OF THE VOTE? EVEN THOUGH, SHE HAS BASICALLY GONE DARK. I AM LOOKING FOR THAT [ INDISCERNIBLE ]. I AM LOOKING FOR, IN A COUPLE HOURS, THE NEXT MORNING FOR THE GENERAL ELECTION TO KICK OFF, BECAUSE IT IS ALL SAID AND DONE >> ABOUT MARKET. WEIGH IN ON THAT POINT. DO YOU THINK NIKKI HALEY ACTUALLY DROPS OUT TONIGHT? IF TRUMP HAS A TYPE OF NIGHT THAT HE IS POISED TO POTENTIALLY HAVE, THERE COULD ALWAYS BE SURPRISES ON SUPER TUESDAY. DO YOU THINK NIKKI HALEY ANNOUNCES SHE IS DROPPING OUT ON WEDNESDAY? AND, TO UNDERSCORE THIS POINT THAT CORNELL IS MAKING, SHE DOESN'T HAVE ANY EVENTS ON THE SCHEDULE TONIGHT. WE ARE NOT EXPECTING TO HEAR FROM HER. >>. I DON'T THINK SHE DROPS OUT TONIGHT. WHY WOULD SHE WANT TO SHARE THE HEADLINE WITH TRUMP WHEN NIKKI DROPS OUT WHETHER? SHE WAITS UNTIL TOMORROW. NIKKI HALEY DROPS OUT OF THE RACE. BUT YOUR POINT, THE ONLY THING I AM WATCHING FOR. THIS REMINDS ME OF WHEN I VIDEOTAPE A BALL GAME AND MY FRIEND TELLS ME MY TEAM WON >>. THIS MAY BE A VERY ACTIVE NIGHT. OUR CHIEF POLITICAL ANALYST, CHUCK TODD, IS HERE. CHUCK, WEIGH IN ON THIS CONVERSATION WE'RE HAVING, BECAUSE I KNOW YOU ARE WATCHING A LOT >>. HERE IS SORT OF THE WAY TO WATCH YOUR IS ONE WAY TO WATCH TONIGHT, AND THE REASON WE PUT IT THIS WAY IS REALLY. IF THIS NIGHT IS AT ALL INTERESTING, IT IS THE EAST COAST STATES WHEN YOU WIN A RACE, SOMETIMES WHEN IT IS CALLED. IT MATTERS TO ME IF NIKKI HALEY WANTS TO FEEL GOOD ABOUT TONIGHT WINNING VIRGINIA TONIGHT WOULD GET THAT -- SHE HAS GOT A REALISTIC CHANCE. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE STATES AND THIS IS SOMETHING I AM WATCHING, FOR I AM WITH MARK HERE. YOU KNOW DONALD TRUMP IS WINNING TONIGHT. THE QUESTION IS HOW BIG IS THE VICTORY GOING TO BE AND HOW MANY WARNING SIGNS ARE THERE FOR THE GENERAL, ALL THESE PLACES WHERE TRUMP WAS VULNERABLE EIGHT YEARS AGO- VIRGINIA IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF ONE MARCO RUBIO- A WHOLE BUNCH OF INDEPENDENCE. EVERYBODY IN NORTH VIRGINIA SAID: YOU HAVE GOT TO VOTE FOR MARCO RUBIO TO STOP DONALD TRUMP. THIS YEAR IT IS. YOU'VE GOT TO VOTE FOR NIKKI HALEY TO STOP DONALD TRUMP. ARE THERE MORE OF THOSE VOTERS OR LESS? RUBIO LOST BY 24 POINTS, WHAT DOES TONIGHT LOOK LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE? WILL GET COLORED BY HOW SUCCESSFUL SHE IS IN VIRGINIA, BECAUSE IT'S EARLY. YOU KNOW, I AM VERY CURIOUS HOW MANY OF THESE VOTERS ARE JUST DEMOCRATS WANTING TO SEND A MESSAGE TO TRUMP. AND HOW MANY OF THESE ARE REALLY REPUBLICANS WHO ARE LIKE HEY, CAN WE SLOW THE ROLE HERE? WE ARE NOT 100% CONVINCED THAT TRUMP IS THE GUY. I THINK THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WEATHER NIKKI HALEY WINS ANYTHING TONIGHT OR NOT. IF SHE DOESN'T WIN ANYTHING, I THINK MOST OF HER VOTERS ARE ALREADY BIDEN VOTERS. >>. I AM GOING TO ASK YOU TO JOIN US AT THE TABLE. WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION. PICK UP ON WHERE CHUCK LEFT OFF WITH THIS IDEA OF VULNERABILITY. THAT IS REALLY ONE OF THE BIGGEST STORY LINES WE ARE WATCHING PERHAPS, THE BIGGEST STORY LINE WE ARE WATCHING TONIGHT. WHERE IS HE VULNERABLE? OR BECAUSE IT IS SUPER TUESDAY, AS HE STARTED TO CONSOLIDATE MORE SUPPORT. VIRGINIA WILL TELL US A LOT >>. I AM LOOKING AHEAD TO A LOT OF THE GENERAL ELECTION POLLING. WE HAVE SEEN WHICH ACTUALLY SHOWS DONALD TRUMP NOT ONLY WINNING THE NATIONAL VOTE, WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT NEVER HAPPENED IN 2019 OR 2020, THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE DAY. HE WAS BEATING JOE BIDEN HEAD-TO-HEAD. OUR AVERAGE HAS HIM UP TWO RIGHT NOW. I KNOW IT'S EARLY RIGHT NOW IT COULD CHANGE- AND ALSO IN THE SWING STATES. I THINK A LOT OF WHAT WE ARE SEEING IS EITHER INDEPENDENCE AND DEMOCRATS WHO WEREN'T PLANNING TO VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP ANYWAY, OR SOME WHO ARE TRUMP ANYWAY, OR SOME WHO ARE LIKE -- [ INDISCERNIBLE ]. WE SPENT THE LAST SIX WEEKS OF OUR CAMPAIGN BASICALLY TELLING REPUBLICANS. IT IS TIME TO COME HOME. SO ARE MANY OF THEM ALREADY MAKING THAT CASE WHERE. YEAH, I LIKE NIKKI HALEY. SHE IS YOUNG, SHE IS A NEW VOICE, BUT IF IT COMES DOWN TO IT- HEAD- TO-HEAD- I AM TAKING DONALD TRUMP OVER JOE BIDEN. >>. LOOK AT HOW VULNERABLE DONALD TRUMP IS IN THE GENERAL. I AM HEARING THAT A LOT. [ INDISCERNIBLE ]. THESE VULNERABILITIES ARE REAL. [ INDISCERNIBLE ]. >>. IN THE END, EACH CANDIDATE HAS A STORY TO TELL AND LISTEN. I THINK WE KNOW THE STORY THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS TO TELL BECAUSE HE HAS TOLD IT BEFORE. TO THE POINT ABOUT THE POLLS. I SAID IT BEFORE. I THINK DONALD TRUMP IS AT HIS CEILING. WE HAVE SEEN IN PAST ELECTIONS TO THE POINT ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT HE LOSES ANY SUPPORT FROM REPUBLICANS. I HAVE BEEN ON DISPLAY BEFORE, IN 2008, FOR A GUY NAMED OBAMA, AND PEOPLE SAID A LOT OF VOTERS AREN'T GOING TO SUPPORT BARACK OBAMA, AND YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DID: THEY WENT AND SUPPORTED BARACK OBAMA. THIS IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT. THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO HAVE A REAL HANGUP WITH THE CRIMINALITY AND WITH THE CONVICTION. IS THAT A DIFFERENT, VARIABLE MAYBE, BUT I THINK DONALD TRUMP IS AT HIS CEILING. HE GETS WHAT HE IS GOING TO GET PAID TO TAKE ME TO MY NEXT POINT, CHUCK. YOU AND I, FROM THE BEGINNING OF THIS RACE, A LOT OF TIMES HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE CRIMINAL INDICTMENTS AGAINST FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP WHEN THEY START TO IMPACT HIM AS THEY PILE UP. HE HAS ONLY GOTTEN STRONGER IN THE PRIMARY BUT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE HIS FIRST ACTUAL CRIMINAL COURT CASE THIS MONTH. [ INDISCERNIBLE ]. HE IS BEATING BIDEN RIGHT NOW BUT IF HE IS CONVICTED, DO YOU THINK JOE BIDEN INKS OUT A WIN? >>? CONVICTED OF WHAT? THAT DOESN'T MATTER. BECAUSE EIJI AND CAROL, HE HAS BEEN ADJUDICATED WITH A RAPE AND IT DIDN'T MOVE THE NEEDLE. I DON'T SEE HOW ANYTHING ALVIN BRAGG TOUCHES ON -- [ INDISCERNIBLE ]. THERE ARE PLENTY OF PEOPLE WHO CAN MAKE THE LEGAL ARGUMENT HERE THAT HE SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. THE POINT IS: ARE THE VOTERS GOING TO HOLD HIM ACCOUNTABLE? THE ANSWER IS NO. IT BECOMES A PARADE OF NOT DEMOCRATS- NOT ALVIN BRAGG AND FANI WILLIS AND JACK SMITH, BUT MIKE PENCE AND MARK MEADOWS AND BILL BARR PERHAPS SOME PRETTY CREDIBLE PEOPLE. THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT -- THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN AND DEMOCRATS HAVE TO STOP HOPING SOMEBODY ELSE DOES THEIR JOB. MITCH McCONNELL HAS BEEN ALWAYS HOPING SOMEBODY ELSE WOULD TAKE CARE OF TRUMP, AND THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN THIS MYTHOLOGICAL SOMEBODY ELSE -- MAYBE THE COURTS WILL TAKE CARE OF TRUMP. MAYBE THE SUPREME COURT WILL KEEP HIM OFF THE BALLOT. GO BEAT HIM IN THE CAMPAIGN BECAUSE, ULTIMATELY, THAT IS THE MOST DECISIVE WAY YOU CAN DEFEAT DONALD TRUMP. >>. MY THEORY OF THE CASE IS ACTUALLY NOT ABOUT TRUMP. TO YOUR POINT, THEY ARE NOT GOING TO MOVE OFF OF AND AFTER HE HAS BEEN FOUND GUILTY OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. [ INDISCERNIBLE ]. IT'S WHAT HAPPENS TO THE REST OF THE VOTE OUT THERE AND THE REST OF THE VOTE OUT THERE IS NOT ABOUT DONALD TRUMP. IT IS ABOUT THE STORY THAT JOE BIDEN HAS TO TELL. WHEN YOU LOOK OUTSIDE -- WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE POLLING- WHAT HE IS DOING THE LEAST WELL. [ INDISCERNIBLE ]. THOSE YOUNGER VOTERS. THEY ARE NOT HAPPY ABOUT WHAT THEY HAVE SEEN AND THEY WANT CHANGE. >>. [ INDISCERNIBLE ]. THE NEW YORK TIMES POLL: ABOUT 10% OF THE VOTERS FOR BIDEN IN 2020 ARE NOW LOOKING BACK OVER TO TRUMP IN 2024, A CASE OF BUYERS REMORSE WHICH CAN ALSO ALTER THOSE NUMBERS. >> [ INDISCERNIBLE ] >>. I DO THINK THAT THE SPRING POLLING- I WAS ALIVE FOR PRESIDENT KERRY- I MEAN: WHEN YOU ARE WINNING, OKAY, THERE IS A POINT WHERE -- WHO IS WINNING? THE PRIMARIES? RIGHT NOW, DONALD TRUMP. BIDEN IS NOT REALLY WINNING ANYTHING, JOHN KERRY, BETWEEN SUPER TUESDAY AND MARCH OF THAT YEAR, TUESDAY AND MARCH OF THAT YEAR -- [ INDISCERNIBLE ] >>. AND THE FACT IS, I THINK THE NEXT SIX WEEKS ARE GOING TO BE FASCINATING. THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN HAS ACUTE FINANCL ADVANTAGE IN THIS MOMENT. THIS IS WHAT EVERY INCUMBENT ALWAYS HOPES FOR. WHEN THEY GET THEIR OPPONENT, YOU WANT TO BE FINANCIALLY AHEAD SO YOU CAN DEFINE YOUR OPPONENT. HOW DO YOU DEFINE DONALD TRUMP THESE DAYS? BUT THE POINT IS, THEY CAN SORT OF FRAME THE ARGUMENT AND SEE WHAT WORKS HERE. I'M NOT SURE WHAT IS GOING TO WORK. I DON'T KNOW WHAT CHARACTER ATTACKS WORK. ATTACKS, WORK. [ INDISCERNIBLE ]. THIS IS NOT A TRUMP ISSUE. IT IS ASTONISHING. HOW MUCH I HAVE FORGOTTEN THAT HAPPENED IN LIFE BEFORE COVID. DOES IT WORK? DOES IT WORK. DOES IT MOVE THE NEEDLE? THAT IS GOING TO BE A REAL TEST. IN THE NEXT SIX WEEKS, THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET THIS RACE BACK TO EVEN, IF NOT SLIGHTLY AHEAD, ASSUMING THEY REALLY COME IN FULL FORCE IN THE NEXT SIX WEEKS. >> CHUCK QUICKLY. YOU HAVE A BEST CASE, WORST CASE SCENARIO FOR TRUMP. LET'S PUT IT BACK UP. >> GET IT UP THERE- REAL QUICK FOR FOLKS TO SEE. REALLY, IT ALL DEPENDS ON WHAT I WAS SAYING. HE IS GOING TO CLINCH THIS NOMINATION. NEXT WEEK CLINCHES IT THE FOLLOWING WEEK. A LOT OF IT HAS TO DO WITH: TONIGHT: DOES HE CROSS THE THOUSAND DELEGATE BARRIER TONIGHT? I THINK A LOT OF IT HAS TO DO WITH WHAT I SAID EARLIER, WHICH IS. DOES HE WHEN EVERY SINGLE STATE? TONIGHT? I THINK IT IS POSSIBLE HE DOES. HE COULD DO THAT, BUT IF HE DOESN'T, THAT IS WHY VIRGINIA IS GOING TO TELL US EVERYTHING. SOMEHOW, NIKKI HALEY IS GOING TO PULL THE UPSET IN VIRGINIA. PROBABLY MEANS SHE WINS MINNESOTA, ISM, ALSO COLORADO. ALL THREE ARE VERY SIMILAR ELECTORS AS FAR AS THE RULES. THAT'S A DIFFERENT CONVERSATION. TONIGHT THEN, IF DONALD TRUMP ESSENTIALLY SUITES EVERYTHING AND SHE IS ABLE TO CHERRY PICK DELEGATES HERE OR THERE IN THE CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS WHERE SHE IS ALLOWED TO DO IT. SO I THINK IT IS SORT OF LIKE. WE KNOW -- IT GOES BACK TO MARK'S POINT. WE KNOW THE OUTCOME OF THE GAME, WE JUST DON'T KNOW THE FINAL SCORE. >> MARKET PICK UP FROM WHERE TRUMP -- TALK ABOUT SUPER TUESDAY: BEST CASE, WORST CASE SCENARIO. WE ARE WAITING TO SEE IF AND WHEN TRUMP EVENTUALLY CLINCHES THE NOMINATION. WHAT WILL YOU BE WATCHING FOR FROM PRESIDENT BIDEN ON THURSDAY, WHEN HE OFFICIALLY WILL PUT OUT HIS MOST ROBUST CASE YET >>? I THINK THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS IS HE IS TRYING TO CONVINCE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO BELIEVE SOMETHING THAT THEY DON'T SEE AND FEEL WITH THEIR OWN EYES. WHETHER IT IS- HIGH PRICES, THE IMMIGRATION PROBLEM, THE WAR IN EUROPE AND IN THE MIDDLE EAST- HE IS BASICALLY SAYING: EVERYTHING IS GREAT BUT PEOPLE ARE SAYING THEY DON'T FEEL IT OR THEY DON'T EXPERIENCE IT. I THINK THAT IS ALWAYS AN UPHILL CHALLENGE FOR ANY LOCAL CANDIDATE TO TRY TO SAY: DON'T BELIEVE YOUR EYES OR YOUR POCKETBOOK. BELIEVE WHAT I AM TELLING YOU. >> [ INDISCERNIBLE ] >> I HEARD IN 2012,. I DON'T FEEL THE HOPE. THE HOPE AND CHANGE WE WERE PROMISED BUILD A CAMPAIGN. I THINK THEY CAN. >> CHUCK [ INDISCERNIBLE ]. HOW IMPORTANT. [ INDISCERNIBLE ] >>. OBVIOUSLY HE CAN'T HAVE A BAD NIGHT. [ INDISCERNIBLE ]. YOU HAVE GOT THE TESTIMONY THAT COULD COME. BUT CAN I MAKE ONE QUICK POINT HERE? I THINK THEY ARE GOING DOWN- A VERY TRICKY ROAD HERE. IF THEY DECIDE THE BEST THING FOR BIDEN TO DO IS TO START ACTING LIKE TRUMP. DEMOCRATS HATE US WHEN WE DO THIS. BUT DEMOCRATS WANT VOTERS TO HOLD REPUBLICANS TO THIS HIGH STANDARD AND THEN THERE LIKE WE ARE GOING TO LOWER OUR STANDARDS. THEN THEY DON'T LIKE IT WHEN POLITICAL ANTHROPOLOGISTS HERE TELL THEM YOU ARE NOT HOLDING YOURSELF UP. I THINK THERE ARE A BUNCH OF VOTERS IN THE MIDDLE WHO DON'T WANT TO CHOOSE BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE WITH BAD BEHAVIOR. I THINK THIS IS A VERY, VERY, VERY CONTROVERSIAL ROAD FOR BIDEN TO GO DOWN. >>. AND THAT'S WHY EVERY SINGLE WORD IS GOING TO BE SO MEANINGFUL ON THURSDAY NIGHT. THANK YOU FOR A GREAT PANEL, A LOT OF ACTION. THANK YOU CHUCK, TODD, CORONEL AND MARK. APPRECIATE IT. WE WILL SEE YOU ALL BACK HERE TONIGHT FOR OUR SPECIAL COVERAGE STILL TONIGHT. WE ARE LIVE IN THE TWO BIGGEST STATES ON THE MAP. TONIGHT, TEXAS AND >>> TWO OF THE MOST DELEGATE >>>. TWO OF THE MOST DELEGATE RICH STATES HAVE KEY BALLOT RACES. WE ARE GOING TO BE WATCHING CLOSELY. ADAM SCHIFF IS LIKELY TO TAKE THE TOP START TONIGHT. BUT [ INDISCERNIBLE ] REGARDLESS OF PARTY: FACILITY ACROSS ORANGE COUNTY. FACILITY ACROSS ORANGE COUNTY. IF FAILED WHEN KATIE PORTER AND OTHERS WERE ELECTED TO THE HOUSE, THEY ENDED UP FLIPPING IT. THEY ENDED UP FLIPPING IT. KATIE PORTER IS ONE OF THREE DEMOCRATS THAT IS RUNNING TO REPLACE DIANNE FEINSTEIN. WHAT IS SO INTERESTING? AS TO WHAT I'M WATCHING: NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES, DEMOCRATS OUTDO CIRCUMSTANCES. DEMOCRATS OUTDO THE REPUBLICANS TO DO ONE: ADAM SCHIFF. AND KATIE PORTER WAS WHERE THE MONEY WAS AT. ADAM SCHIFF HAS BEEN AGGRESSIVE ON BEHALF OF STEVE GARVEY, A REVERSE PSYCHOLOGY, NEGATIVE AD ATTACKS. HE SAID IT IS A CYNICAL CAMPAIGN THAT HE WANTS TO FACE THE FORMER DODGER, A REPUBLICAN. THE FORMER DODGER- A REPUBLICAN- IN THE ELECTION. SCHIFF HITS HER BACK AND SAYS THAT YOU ARE DOING THE SAME THING. PORTER IS NOT SPENDING THAT KIND OF MONEY ELEVATING REPUBLICANS. THAT ADAM SCHIFF HAS DONE. IT'S BEEN A SUCCESSFUL CAMPAIGN, AND WE COULD SEE SCHIFF AND GARVEY IN NOVEMBER. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT SCHIFF WANTS. REPORTER BARBARA LEE. THE OTHER ONES IN THE RACE ARE NOT HAPPY ABOUT THAT. >>. I KNOW IT IS A BIG CONTROVERSY IN THAT RACE. OBVIOUSLY, STEVE GARVEY HAS A LOT OF NAME. RECOGNITION. THANK YOU FOR THAT GREAT REPORTING ON THE GROUND. LET'S TALK ABOUT --. HOW CONCERNED ARE THEY ABOUT PASSING THE 50% MARK? >>. Reporter. I SPOKE TO THE CONGRESSMAN THIS MORNING AND HE SAID HE'S EXCITED ABOUT TONIGHT. THEY RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE NINE OTHER DEMOCRATS ON THE BALLOT TODAY VYING FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE ON TED CRUZ. IT COULD MEAN THAT HE DID NOT GET OVER THE 50% THRESHOLD AND IT DOES GO TO A RUNOFF. THE REALITY, HIS MESSAGES THROUGHOUT, THIS HAS BEEN ON HITTING TED CRUZ WITH THE ISSUE OF ABORTION. HE SAID THAT REGARDLESS IF HE HAS TO SPEND ANOTHER TWO MONTHS DISHING IT OUT WITH THE DEMOCRATS, THE MESSAGE WILL REMAIN THE SAME. >> YOU TALKED TO HIM ABOUT. >> YOU TALKED TO HIM ABOUT- WHETHER OR NOT -- THE CAMPAIGN WITH PRESIDENT BIDEN. >> HE DID NOT GIVE ME A STRAIGHT ANSWER ON THAT. IT CAME UP BECAUSE WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE ISSUE OF IMMIGRATION AND HE SAYS HE HAS NOT SHIED AWAY. HE EXPRESSED MORE URGENCY AND LESS OF A STATUS QUO ON THAT ISSUE. HE FEELS THE ADMINISTRATION IS MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION. I ASKED HIM THAT IF BIDEN COMES TO TOWN, WE YOU CAMPAIGN WITH HIM. I WILL PLAY THAT FOR YOU. >> DO YOU PLAN TO CAMPAIGN WITH BIDEN? >> IF HE PLANS TO COME, WILL YOU JOIN HIM? >> LIKE I SAID, WHOEVER COMES, TRUMP, BIDEN, ANYBODY ELSE YOU WILL NOT HEAR DIFFERENT FROM ME. I FOCUSED ON HOW TED CRUZ DOES. I FOCUSED ON HOW TED CRUZ DOES NOT REPRESENT US. >> YOU HEARD HIM CHUCKLING AND SMILING, BUT NOT ANSWERING THAT QUESTION. THE REALITY IS THE PEOPLE AT THE TOP OF THE BALLOT ARE GOING TO IMPACT THE RACE, AND IT'S LIKELY SHAPING UP TO BE PRESIDENT BIDEN AND FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP. WE KNOW THAT VOTERS ARE MORE CONFIDENT IN THE REPUBLICANS TO HANDLE THE BORDER. EVERY VOTER THAT I SPOKE TO TODAY THE BORDER HAS BEEN ONE OF THE FIRST ISSUES OUT OF THEIR MOUTH WHEN I ASKED WHAT IS ANIMATING THEM FOR THIS ELECTION CYCLE? ELECTION CYCLE: >>. ABOUT 30 SECONDS LEFT CAME CLOSE TO BEATING TED CRUZ IN 2018.. DOES THAT MAKE NERVOUS? >>. YES >>. Reporter. DEMOCRATS HAVE NOT SEEN A TIGHT MARGIN STATEWIDE. THIS IS A DIFFERENT TIME. THE ISSUES ARE DIFFERENT AND HE IS USED TO BEING THE LONGSHOT. HE BELIEVES THAT HE AN BEAT THE ODDS THIS TIME >>. WE WILL WATCH IT VERY CLOSELY, THANK YOU. THAT DOES IT FOR US. THAT DOES IT FOR US. DO NOT GO ANYWHERE.",[52]

COVERAGE CONTINUES WITH HALLIE COVERAGE CONTINUES WITH HALLIE JACKSON, RIGHT NOW. >>>. MARCH MAY BE MAKING HISTORY ALREADY, AS WE ARE COMING ON THE AIR WITH A HUGE AND DANGEROUS BLIZZARD. OUT WEST BLOCKING ROADS, LOOK AT THE CONDITIONS CRASHES, BIG CONCERNS NOW ABOUT AVALANCHES. WE ARE LIVE ON THE GROUND WITH THIS PRETTY INTENSE FLIP SCREEN MOMENT, WITH THE FEET OF SNOW AND THE THOUSANDS OF ACRES OF FIRES BURNING OVER IN TEXAS, PLUS THE WEATHER SYSTEM BEHIND IT ALL. >>>. THEN PRESIDENT BIDEN LATE TODAY SAYING THE US WILL AIR DROP FOOD INTO GAZA, PROMISING TO PULL OUT EVERY STOP TO GET HELP TO THE INNOCENT PEOPLE THAT NEED IT. THERE MORE ON THAT AND THE NEW CLUES HE IS GIVING ABOUT A POTENTIAL CEASEFIRE IN JUST A MINUTE. >>> A CRITICAL DAY IN TWO CASES AGAINST FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP. THAT COULD DETERMINE WHEN OR IF HE GOES TO TRIAL. WHAT IS BEHIND ONE STATE'S PROPOSAL TO BAND LEGACY ADMISSIONS- NOT JUST PUBLIC COLLEGES BUT PRIVATE ONES TOO. >>>. THE FIRST BLOCKBUSTER OF TWENTY24 IS OUT TONIGHT. DOES ""DUNEII"" HAVE ENOUGH TO BREAK THE $1 BILLION MARK LATER ON IN THE SHOW? >>>. HEY, THERE I'M HALLIE RIGHT NOW THE BIGGEST SNOWSTORM THAT WE HAVE SEEN THIS SEASON IS POUNDING THE WEST. IT IS DANGEROUS, IT IS HISTORY. IT IS LIFE-THREATENING. WHITEOUTS ON THE ROAD. IMAGINE LOOKING THROUGH YOUR WINDSHIELDS AND SEEING THAT IF YOU ARE NOT OUT BY NOW, DON'T BOTHER TO LEAVE. STAY WHERE YOU ARE, HUNKER DOWN, TRY TO WEATHER THE STORM OUT. YOU CAN SEE IT HERE: SOME OF THE DAMAGE FROM THE BLIZZARD THAT WELL IT, USED TO BE A TRACTOR, TRAILER, FUNCTIONAL- ALL SMASHED UP IN THE CRASH AVALANCHE ALERTS AT THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE LEVELS. HERE IS A LIVE LOOK RIGHT NOW, UP AT UC BERKELEY'S SIERRA SNOW LAB. SNOW TOTALS CAN GET UP TO 12 FEET. JUST TO GIVE YOU PERSPECTIVE, THAT IS TWO OF ME- MORE THAN TWO OF ME- STACKED UP ON TOP OF ALL OF THAT SNOW. YOU HAVE INTENSE WINDS, 100 MILES AN HOUR, ALL OF IT CREATING DANGEROUS CONDITIONS. T IS NOT JUST OUT WEST AND THE SNOW EITHER IT IS. WHAT IS HAPPENING IN TEXAS WITH ANOTHER DISASTER? THE WILDFIRES, BIG, DEADLY, THICK SMOKE BLANKETING THE PANHANDLE. T IS GETTING WINDIER WARMER. IT WILL MAKE IT HARDER TO FIGHT. WE HAVE REPORTERS SPREAD OUT. WE HAVE STEVE IN TAHOE, CALIFORNIA, BILL KARINS TRACKING IT ALL STEVE. WE WILL START WITH YOU. >>>. THE CONDITIONS RAPIDLY DETERIORATING. WE HAVE SEEN IT HOUR AFTER HOUR. THE TEMPERATURES DROPPING. THE FLURRIES ARE PICKING UP. THE BIG THINGS ARE THE WIND. IT IS PICKING UP RIGHT NOW. STILL KIND OF PERFECT SKI CONDITIONS. HERE IT IS SHUTDOWN, HEAVENLY SKI RESORT- ONE OF MANY SKI RESORTS IN THIS AREA- SAYING YOU KNOW, WE KNOW WHAT IS COMING. WE ARE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND THROW IN THE TOWEL A LOT OF RESIDENTS DOING THE SAME. THIS IS EXPECTED TO BE A WINTER STORM THAT CAN CAUSE SEVERE DAMAGE, CAN SNARL TRAFFIC, CAN LOCK PEOPLE IN PLACE FOR DAYS IN THE MOUNTAINS. YOU GO UP HIGH ENOUGH. YOU ARE TALKING: 15-16 FEET OF SNOW COMING IN AT 100 TO 110, TO 120 MILES AN HOUR. LOWER ELEVATIONS STILL, BAD, MAYBE 3-4 FEET OF SNOW WHERE I AM STANDING WHEN IT COMES DOWN. IT CAN COME DOWN AT 50-60 MILES AN HOUR. A BLIZZARD WARNING- ONE OF EIGHT ISSUED SINCE 2002.. PEOPLE IN THIS AREA OF COURSE ARE HARDY. THEY ARE USED TO IT. THE LAST ONE WE HAD WAS ALMOST EXACTLY A YEAR AGO. WE KNOW WHAT KIND OF CALAMITY THAT CAUSED: ROOFS WERE CAVING IN BECAUSE FOUR FEET OF SNOW WAS ON PEOPLE'S HOUSES. PEOPLE WERE TRAPPED FOR DAYS. RESIDENTS ARE STOCKING UP, GATHERING GAS CHAINS, FUEL, FOOD, WHATEVER THEY CAN, TO HUNKER DOWN OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS. OR SO, WITH SOME OF THE MAJOR AREAS THATTING DOWN LIKE I-80, TRAFFIC SNARLED, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MOVE. LET'S GET THOSE WILDFIRES IN TEXAS. WE KNOW TWO PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED, BUT THE BIGGEST FIRE ONLY ABOUT 15% CONTAINED. WE CONTINUE TO COVER THIS STORY FOR US IN THE PANHANDLE OF TEXAS. THINGS CAN GET WORSE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE SHIFT IN THE WEATHER. TALK US THROUGH IT >>>. YOU TALK ABOUT THE SHIFT IN THE WEATHER. YESTERDAY WE WERE HERE. IT SEEMS UNREAL THAT WE WERE WEARING JACKETS AND HATS BECAUSE IT WAS SNOWING AND IT WAS RAINING. AT ONE POINT ICE COMING DOWN, AND NOW IT IS HOT. THE SUN IS BURNING ON OUR FACES AS WE COVER THIS WILDFIRE. YOU CAN SEE PART OF THE AREA IN CANADA. THIS IS THE OUT SKIRTS OF CANADIAN ONE OF THE PROPERTIES THAT BURNED MAKING IT INTO THIS AREA. I HAVE BEEN SPEAKING TO THE NEIGHBORS HERE WHO TALKED ABOUT HOW FAST THIS FIRE SPREAD THROUGH THESE AREAS. NOW, BEFORE THIS WAS BURNED DOWN, IT HAD A LOT OF VEGETATION. THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE ACROSS THE STATE IN THE AREAS WHERE THE FIRE HAS NOT BURNED YET. SO WHY IS IT DORNLINGS HAVE THESE TEMPERATURES INCREASE AND TO HAVE MORE WINDS COMING UP BECAUSE THAT COULD IGNITE THE FIRES ONCE AGAIN. SO I AM BEING TOLD BY THE OFFICIALS. THAT AREAS LIKE THE ONE BEHIND ME WHERE WE STILL, HAVE PARTS OF THE FIELD THAT DID NOT BURN COMPLETELY. WE HAVE SOME OVER HERE TOO- THAT COULD START AGAIN. EVEN SOME OF THE AREAS LIKE THIS WHERE WE SEEN IT BURN ALREADY- THAT COULD START LIGHTING UP AGAIN. IT WOULD REQUIRE DAYS OF RAIN AND LOW TEMPERATURES FOR ALL OF THESE FIELDS TO BE COMPLETELY DONE AND FOR THESE HOT SPOTS TO BE TURNED OFF. SO THAT IS WHY THEY HAVE TO REMAIN VIGILANT, HALLIE. >> IT IS SO HARD FOR THE FOLKS STARTING TO COME BACK TO SEE WHATEVER MIGHT BE LEFT OF WHAT USED TO BE THEIR HOMES. >>. Reporter. CORRECT, AS I MENTIONED, THIS IS ONE OF THE STRUCTURES DESTROYED BY THE FIRE, MOST OF THE STRUCTURES HERE IN CANADIAN THAT HAD THE FIRE COME UP TO, THE STRUCTURE REMEMBER COMPLETELY BURNED. AT LEAST THAT IS WHAT WE SEEN. THE GOVERNOR WAS IN NORTH TEXAS AND HE SPOKE ABOUT IT. THIS IS WHAT GREG ABBOTT HAD TO SAY: >> WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DAMAGES THAT OCCURRED HERE, IT IS JUST GONE, COMPLETELY GONE. NOTHING LEFT BUT ASHES ON THE GROUND. >>. Reporter. THE GOVERNOR INDICATED THAT, RIGHT. NOW THE ASSESSMENTS INDICATE THEY COULD HAVE ANYWHERE FROM 400 TO 500 STRUCTURES THAT BURNED DOWN. THIS IS ALL ACROSS TEXAS AND A LOT OF THE STRUCTURES, HALLIE, ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF RANCHES RIGHT. YOU HAVE COMMUNITIES LIKE CANADIANS- THESE AREAS WE HAVE BEEN TO, BUT THEN YOU HAVE A LOT OF RANCHES WITH STRUCTURES THAT BURNED. THEY ARE ASSESSING THE DAMAGE AS THEY PREPARE FOR WHAT IS COMING- THE INCREASE IN THE TEMPERATURES AND WINDS. AND ALSO THEY ARE WAITING FOR THAT FEDERAL HELP. REMEMBER, PRESIDENT BIDEN SAID YESTERDAY THEY WERE GOING TO SEND AN AIR TANKER, SMALL PLANES, HELICOPTERS TO HELP OUT. >> LIVE IN THE TOWN OF CANADIAN TEXAS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >>>. BILL KARINS TRACKING THE SYSTEM. THE WEATHER SYSTEM CAN PROVIDE RELIEF IN SOME INCIDENTS OR MAKE THINGS WORSE RIGHT >>. Reporter. YEAH, AND ALSO, ANY TIME WE GET THE BIG SWINGS, IT WILL BE WINDY TOO WINDY FROM THE PLAINS ALL OF THE WAY THROUGH THE WEST COAST, THE BIG STORM COMING IN. LET'S START WITH WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW AND THE MOST DANGEROUS WEATHER THAT IS IN AREAS OF THE WEST. WE HAVE GOTTEN SIGNIFICANT SNOW. IF YOU GO TO DONNER SNOW, WE ARE OVER 20 INCHES. PALISADES, TAHOE AND NORTH STAR. WE ARE GETTING THESE OVER THE FOOT. WE WILL SEE WHO WILL BE THE FIRST TO GET TO 2 FEET OF SNOW AS FAR AS THE STORM GOES. THIS STARTED AT 1:00 TODAY, LATER TONIGHT AND THEN TOMORROW IT WILL BE ROUND 2 AND THE SNOW WILL BE LIGHTER AND FLUFFIER, POSSIBLY GETTING 1-2 FEET IN 12 HOURS LATER ON TONIGHT DURING THE OVERNIGHT HOURS. IT WILL BE TREACHEROUS TO BE ON ANY OF THE PASSES. A LOT OF THEM ARE SHUTDOWN, NOT LETTING YOU THROUGH. IT IS GOING TO LINGER EVEN INTO SATURDAY. ALL OF THE BLUE SHOWS LEAF SNOW IN THE CALIFORNIA AND THE SIERRA. BY THE TIME WE GET TO SUNDAY IT TAPERS OFF A LITTLE BIT. SUNDAY WILL BE THE CLEANUP DAY AND THEN MONDAY WILL BE THE DAY THAT, HOPEFULLY, THE ROADS AND EVERYONE CAN TRY TO GET THEIR LIFE BACK TO NORMAL. WE WILL GET SOME RAIN IN SAN FRANCISCO AND SANTA BARBARA AND LOS ANGELES, BUT NOT LIKE THE BIG STORMS. IT WILL JUST BE A RAINY SATURDAY FOR YOU. THE SNOW IN THE MOUNTAINS. DIFFERENT STORY. AS FAR AS THE PROBLEM WITH FIRE WEATHER, OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE THE AREA WITH ALL OF THE HORRIBLES NORTH OF AMARILLO. LOOK AT THE HUGE AREA UNDER RED FLAG, WARNING WITH. IT WILL BE A DANGEROUS DAY TOMORROW FROM ESPECIALLY COLORADO INTO KANSAS AND AREAS OF NEW MEXICO. CRITICAL FIRE RISK AREA. IF ANY FIRE FORMS, THE HUMIDITY IS VERY LOW. IT WILL BE EXTREMELY WINDY. THAT IS WHAT WE ARE CONCERNED WITH: RAPID FIRE GROWTH IF ANY FIRES FORM. SO 30,, 40,, 60 MILE-AN-HOUR GUSTS AS WE GO THROUGH THE DAY TOMORROW. THIS IS THE REGION WHERE, BY THE WAY, WE SAW, WHERE THE HORRIBLE FIRES HAVE BEEN TOMORROW, 40 MILE-AN-HOUR WINDS >>. THAT WILL MAKE IT SO TOUGH TO GET THE CREWS ON THE HANDLES OF THE FIRES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. A LOT OF WORK AHEAD FOR YOU THIS WEEKEND, I KNOW. >>>. TO WASHINGTON, PRESIDENT BIDEN ANNOUNCING THAT THE US IS GOING TO AIR DROP FOOD INTO GAZA. NEW FEARS NOW. THAT AREA WILL REACH FAMINE SOON. HERE IS THE PRESIDENT >>. THE TRUTH IS: AID GOING TO GAZA IS NOWHERE NEARLY ENOUGH. LIVES ARE ON THE LINE AND CHILDREN'S LIVES ARE ON THE LINE. WE WILL NOT JUST STAND BY WAITING FOR THE AID TO GET IN THERE >>. YOU HEARD THE PRESIDENT TALKING ABOUT THE CHILDREN'S LIVES ON THE LINE. THE BACKDROP FLEW REPORTS OF BABIES IN GAZA FROM DYING FROM MALNUTRITION AND STARVATION. ISRAEL IS FACING ACCUSATIONS OF ATTACKING CROWDS IN GAZA CITY WITH MORE THAN 100 PEOPLE DEAD. I AM GOING TO BRING IN JOSH PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO GET THE AID AND THE FOOD AND THE HELP THAT THEY NEED. TALK TO US ABOUT THE PLAN THAT THE PRESIDENT IS ANNOUNCING, JUST IN THE LAST COUPLE OF HOURS, TO LITERALLY DROP HELP INTO GAZA. WHY NOW? >>. Reporter WELL, WHAT EVERYONE WANTS TO KNOW RIGHT. NOW DID PRESIDENT BIDEN ORDER THE AIRDROPS BECAUSE OF THE CATASTROPHE WE SAW YESTERDAY WITH WELL OVER 100 APPARENTLY KILLED IN CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE DISPUTED, BUT HAVE TO DO WITH DELIVERY OF THE AID BY TRUCK THROUGH THE GAZA STRIP. THE WHITE HOUSE WOULD NOT QUITE SAY THEY WERE EMPHASIZING THE FACT THAT IT HAS BEEN UNDER DISCUSSION FOR SEVERAL WEEKS BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO GET THE LEVELS OF AID TO WHERE THEY WANT THEM TO BE. THE FACT OF THE MATTER: IT WILL BE DIFFICULT. IT WILL NOT BE A ONE OFF. THEY WILL DO MULTIPLE AIRDROPS OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. THE LEGISTICS ARE REALLY TOUGH FOR THE MILITARY TO CARRY OUT FIRST OF ALL. YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE, WHEN YOU ARE DROPPING THINGS FROM PLANES, THAT THE AID ITSELF DOES NOT FALL ON PEOPLE AND INJURY OR KILL THEM. YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT, WHEN THE AID ARRIVES ON THE GROUND, YOU DON'T HAVE THE KINDS OF REALLY TERRIBLE INCIDENTS. WE SAW YESTERDAY WHERE PEOPLE STAMPEDE OVER EACH OTHER TRYING TO GET THEIR HANDS ON THE AID. YOU ALSO HAVE THE FACT THAT THE PLANES WILL BE FLYING THROUGH AN ACTIVE WAR ZONE. IT IS A DIFFICULT MISSION. IT CLEARLY MAKES VERY EVIDENT THAT THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION DOES NOT FEEL NEARLY ENOUGH. AMOUNT OF US AND OTHER HUMANITARIAN AID IS MAKING IT INTO THE GAZA STRIP AND THEY ARE TAKING EXTRAORDINARY STEPS OF AIR, DROPPING IT IN AND LEAVING OPEN THE POSSIBILITY THAT THEY ARE GOING TO BRING IN AID THROUGH THE MARITIME ROUTE, ESSENTIALLY BY SHIP, THROUGH THE WEEKS AND MONTHS. HALLIE >>. YOU HAVE THIS DISCUSS OF WHEN A CEASEFIRE, WHEN SOMETHING LIKE THAT CAN HAPPEN TO GET THE 130 HOSTAGES STILL BELIEVED TO BE HELD IN HAMAS AND IN GAZA. OUT ANY UPDATE ON THAT AFTER THE PRESIDENT SAID DAYS AGO HE HOPE TODAY WOULD HAPPEN WITHIN A WEEK >>. Reporter. I THINK IT IS CLEAR AT THIS POINT. THE PRESIDENT MIGHT OF GOTTEN AHEAD ON HIS SPEECH AND WHAT HE PUT OUT THAT POTENTIALLY MONDAY DEADLINE- IF YOU WANT TO CALL IT THAT OR THREW OUT THAT DATE IN HIS RECENT COMMENTS, BIDEN IS HOPEFUL FOR A DEAL BUT PROBABLY NOT BY MONDAY. TODAY THE WHITE HOUSE SAID THEY ARE STILL OPTIMISTIC BUT ARE NOT PUTTING ANY DATES ON IT. THAT FOLLOWED A LOT OF SKEPTICISM FROM HAMAS, ISRAEL, EVEN FROM COUNTRIES, BROKERS, THE DEAL THAT ANYTHING COULD COME OUT THAT SOON. EVERYBODY IS TRYING TO MAINTAIN THE APPEARANCE OF OPTIMISM THAT A DEAL IS STILL POSSIBLE. I THINK NOBODY SHOULD HOLD THEIR BREATH. WE WILL SEE IT AS SOON AS MONDAY. THAT IS STILL SIGNIFICANT ISSUE. THAT NEED TO BE WORKED OUT BEFORE WE ARE ANYWHERE NEAR THAT DEAL. OF COURSE, THE HOLIDAY ABOUT TO START. THAT IS A BIG DEADLINE, HALLIE. >>. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT REPORTING. A LOT OF THREAD TO PULL ON THAT. A LOT TO PULL ON HERE BACK AT HOME IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS WE ARE SET TO KNOW IF GEORGIA'S ENTIRE ELECTION CASE COULD FALL APART. THE JUDGE IS DECIDING WHETHER OR NOT TO KICK THE DA OFF OF THE CASE. ALL TOGETHER, IT IALL AFTER THIS DRAMATIC MISCONDUCT HEARING, CENTERING AROUND ONE QUESTION: DID FANI WILLIS- YOU CAN SEE HER THERE- DID SHE FINANCIAL BENEFIT IMPROPERLY FROM A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR SHE HIRED MASON WADE TO WORK ON THE CASE? HER TEAM? THEY SAY NO, THERE IS NO DIRECT EVIDENCE OF THAT. >>. YOU HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE IN THE PUBLIC. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS MAKE A FINDING OF FACT THAT YOU HAVE GENUINE, LEGITIMATE CONCERNS ABOUT THEIR CREDIBILITY, ABOUT THEIR TRUTHFULNESS. THESE PEOPLE, YOUR HONOR, IT IS A SYSTEMATIC PROBLEM. THEY NEED TO GO. >>. IF SHE IS KICKED OFF OF THIS CASE, IT MEANS IT WOULD HAVE TO GO TO ANOTHER COUNTY'S PROSECUTOR AND NOT CLEAR AT ALL. ANY OTHER PROSECUTOR WILL TAKE IT UP, MEANING THE CASE AGAINST THE FORMER PRESIDENT AND CO- DEFENDANTS COULD GO POOF THE TRUMP TEAM'S ARGUMENT. THEY EMPLOYED A QUESTION FROM THE JUDGE AND THEY FOCUSED ON- BASICALLY, THERE IS NO CONCRETE EVIDENCE. THE JUDGE WAS DRILLING HIM ON THIS TALK, US THROUGH THIS. >>. YES, SO MY BEST SUMMARY HERE, BECAUSE WE HEARD A LOT, NOT JUST TODAY BUT OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS. HERE THE DEFENSE ATTORNEY IS MAKING THE CASE. THEY HAVE THE EVIDENCE OF AN APPEARANCE OF A CONFLICT OF INTEREST. WE HEARD TODAY, AMONG THE MANY PEOPLE THAT SPOKE TODAY, A LAWYER REPRESENTING ROMAN. THIS WAS THE INITIAL ONE TO DISQUALIFY HERE AND HER TEAM HERE. THEY SAID TODAY THEY DON'T NEED TO SHOW AN ACTUAL CONFLICT, THAT THE APPEARANCE WOULD BE SUFFICIENT. SO, OF COURSE, THE STATE ARGUING THE OPPOSITE. BEFORE I GET INTO THAT, I WANT TO TAKE YOU TO WHAT WE HEARD A LITTLE BIT EARLIER THIS AFTERNOON. >>. THERE WAS 0 EVIDENCE, NOT A SINGLE SHRED OF EVIDENCE THAT WAS INTRODUCED TO ANY OF THE EXHIBITS OR THE WITNESS TESTIMONY SHOWING HOW THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS, THEIR DUE PROCESS RIGHTS, ERE AT ALL EFFECTED BY THE RELATIONSHIP THAT BEGAN IN MARCH OF 2022. >>. Reporter. SO TODAY, A LOT OF THE BACK AND FORTH WAS SURROUNDING THE QUESTION ON WHETHER OR NOT THE CASE COULD BE MADE THAT THIS DISQUALIFICATION CAN BE MADE ON THE APPEARANCE OF A CONFLICT OF INTEREST. A LOT OF BACK AND FORTH THERE AND THE JUDGE, JUST TO POINT OUT, HAS PREVIOUSLY SAID THERE COULD BE DISQUALIFICATION ON THAT BASIS BUT OF COURSE, THE BIG QUESTION IS: WILL THERE BE? I WANT TO ADD A COUPLE MORE THINGS. THE QUESTION OF EVIDENCE: THERE WAS A LOT OF QUESTIONS IN THE LAST 24 HOURS. WE KNOW THE DEFENSE WAS TRYING TO SUBMIT ALL OF THIS- CELL PHONE DATA, TEXT MESSAGES AND ALSO THAT THE STATE WAS TRYING TO HAVE THE COURT HEAR FROM SOMEONE WHO WAS AN EMPLOYEE FROM NAPA VALLEY ABOUT PAYING IN CASH. BASICALLY, BOTH TRIED SUBMITTING MORE EVIDENCE. THEY SAID: I DON'T WANT TO HEAR MORE EVIDENCE, I JUST WANT TO HEAR THE ARGUMENTS AND THEN I WILL DECIDE IF I WANT MORE EVIDENCE. >>. Reporter. AT THE VERY END TODAY OUR PRODUCER POINTED THIS OUT. THE JUDGE SAID: YOU WILL HEAR FROM ME IN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS. I WILL LET YOU KNOW WE NEED MORE INFORMATION. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT IN TWO WEEKS WE WILL HEAR THAT THE JUDGE WANTS MORE EVIDENCE. THERE IS STILL A QUESTION IF WE WILL HAVE A DECISION IN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS. OF COURSE, THAT IS WHAT EVERYONE IS HOPING FOR. THE JUDGE DOES NOT WANT TO KEEP IT DRAGGING. HE WANTS TO KEEP IT MOVING. >>. ALL OF THE QUESTIONS COME BACK TO ONE THREAD. THAT IS TIMING AND TIME LINE. THAT IS WHAT IS SO CRITICAL NOW, ESPECIALLY IN A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION YEAR, OBVIOUSLY AS WE ARE CLOSING IN ON SUPER TUESDAY, THE CONVENTIONS AND THE GENERAL ELECTION IN NOVEMBER. SO LET'S SAY RIGHT- AND I REALIZE WE ARE LIVING IN THE LAND OF THE HYPOTHETICAL- BUT LET'S DO IT FOR A SECOND. IF THE JUDGE COMES BACK AND ALLOWS WILLIS TO CONTINUE THIS CASE AND SHE CONTINUES TO PROSECUTE FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP, WHEN CAN WE POTENTIALLY SEE HIM IN COURT FACING THIS TRIAL? >>. Reporter. THAT IS A GREAT QUESTION. WE DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO HALLIE. A TRIAL HAS NOT BEEN SET. I SPOKE TO OUR PRODUCER ON THE GROUND HERE, WHO IS FILLING ME IN ON EVERYTHING HE HAS BEEN FOLLOWING OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS HERE EXPLAINING. THE JUDGE HAS A BUSY MONTH AT THE VERY LEAST. IT WILL NOT BE IN THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE. LET'S SAY WE HAD A DECISION ON MONDAY. IT WOULD NOT IN BE IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS. HE HAS MORE TRIALS. WE DON'T HAVE A DATE. WE KNOW THAT JUST FROM WHAT THE JUDGE SAID. HE WANTS TO KEEP IT MOVING AND TIMING IS IMPORTANT. THAT IS ONLY IN THIS WORLD OF HYPOTHETICALS, WHERE WE WOULD SAY THAT FANI WILLIS AND HER TEAM IS STAYING ON THIS, JUST IN TERMS OF TRUMP, THE FORMER PRESIDENT, APPEARING IN COURT, HE CAN SHOW UP WHEREVER HE WANTS ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT AND IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE THE DAY THAT WILLIS TOOK THE STAND IN A DRAMATIC TESTIMONY. SO IT IS NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION IF WE SEE HIM IN TERMS OF ANY DATES AND FORMAL DATES OF SEEING HIM ON THE STAND- BIG QUESTION. WE DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER TO YET >>. THANK YOU SO MUCH APPRECIATE IT >>>. ANOTHER ONE OF TRUMP'S LEGAL BATTLES, HONESTLY. ANOTHER QUESTION: MARK HERE, WITH HIS LAWYERS DOWN IN FLORIDA, HEAD-TO-HEAD WITH THE SPECIAL COUNSEL, ON THE FEDERAL DOCUMENT CASE SHOULD BEGIN A DIFFERENT CASE. THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE DOCUMENTS SET FOR MAY 20th. RIGHT NOW THE MIDDLE OF JULY. TRUMP IS LIKE MID-AUGUST- SOUNDS GOOD IN THE MIDDLE OF BOTH OF THOSE DATES, THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION. WE BRING IT UP BECAUSE POLITICS ARE AT PLAY HERE. THE FORMER PRESIDENT'S TEAM SAYS, REALLY, ANY SUMMER TRIAL IS TOO CLOSE TO AN ELECTION AND TOO CLOSE TO HIS STATE TRIAL. ON YET, ANOTHER ISSUE IN NEW YORK WHICH IS SET TO START AT THE END OF THIS MONTH. JUST TO REMIND YOU, AT THE CASE AT HAND. HE FACES 40 CHARGES FOR ALLEGEDLY TAKING TOP SECRET FILES. HE SHOULD NOT HAVE. PICTURE SAYS 1,000 WORDS. THIS IS IT. PICTURES LIKE THESE. THEY ARE LAID OUT IN THE BATHROOM ON A STAGE, ET CETERA. THAT IS THE CASE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. NO RULING TODAY. HELP US READ THE LEAVES HERE. WHICH WAY IS THE JUDGE LEANING ON WHEN THIS TRIAL SHOULD START? >>. Reporter. YOU KNOW HARD TO KNOW HER, MIND HALLIE. I CAME AWAY TODAY REASONABLY OPTIMISTIC- IF THAT IS THE WORD- OR CONFIDENT THAT THERE IS MORE OF A CHANCE THAN I THOUGHT THAT THIS CASE COULD GO TO TRIAL BEFORE THE NOVEMBER ELECTION, IN PART BECAUSE BOTH SIDES LAID OUT A CALENDAR, AS YOU SAID. THAT HAS THIS CASE GOING TO TRIAL IN OVER THE SUMMER OF COURSE IN THE CASE OF THE TRUMP LAWYERS. THEY DON'T MEAN IT, THEY MADE IT CLEAR TODAY. THEY HAVE NO DESIRE AND NO INTENTION OF HAVING THIS CASE GO TO TRIAL BEFORE THE ELECTION. THEY SAID THAT WOULD AMOUNT TO ELECTION INTERFERENCE. HE BELONGS ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL AND SHOULD NOT BE SITTING IN THE COURTROOM. IT WAS INTERESTING THAT THE JUDGE, A TRUMP EMPLOYEE, DID NOT PUSH BACK ON THAT IN STARK CONTRAST. RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT DOES NOT EXEMPT YOU FROM YOUR DUTIES AND OBLIGATIONS AS A CRIMINAL DEFENDANT OTHER THAN THAT TODAY, BOTH SIDES ARGUED ABOUT PROCEDURAL ISSUES. ONE OF THE QUESTIONS IS THAT IT WILL BE IN THE INTELLIGENCE CASE. THEY ARE NOT PART OF THE PROSECUTION TEAM. HE CAME AWAY FROM TODAY WITH CONFIRMATION THAT THE TRUMP TEAM IS DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO SLOW THE CASE DOWN AND JACK SMITH IS TRYING TO GET IT TO TRIAL AS QUICKLY AS IT TO TRIAL AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. HALL SNY, HALLIE >>>. NOW, THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE DEFYING HEAVY SECURITY AT THE DEFYING HEAVY SECURITY AT THE FUNERAL OF ALEXEI NAVALNY. HE DIED SUDDENLY MANY BLAMING PUTIN. ACCORDING TO WHAT SOURCES IMAGES COMING INTO US NOW FROM RUSSIA. WHAT ELSE DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE FALL OUT, THESE ARRESTS? THESE ARE POTENTIALLY NOT SURPRISING, CONSIDERING HOW MANY PEOPLE CAME OUT FOR THIS FUNERAL. >>. Reporter. THAT IS RIGHT. >>. Reporter, THAT IS RIGHT. THEY MADE CLEAR THAT, AS YOU CALLED IT, UNAUTHORIZED GATHERINGS WOULD BE ILLEGAL. THEY WILL BE RELEASED, THEY WILL BE FINED. JUST THINK ABOUT ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE STANDING, THOSE, THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE STANDING LINING THE STREETS TODAY. ANY ONE OF THEM COULD BE FACING UP TO 15 YEARS IN JAIL. THAT IS THE BRAVERY OF THOSE PEOPLE. WHAT HAPPENED TO THOSE ARRESTED? IT IS ACROSS FROM RUSSIA NOW. THAT IS THE NATURE OF RUSSIA, THESE DAYS. WE WILL NOT BE TOLD BUT THESE PICTURES, EXTRAORDINARY PICTURES. FAR MORE PEOPLE THAN WE FRANKLY HAD EXPECTED YESTERDAY. WE GUESSED THAT IT JUST TELLS YOU SOMETHING. THAT WHILE THE KREMLIN BELIEVED THAT IT WAS SILENCING NEVALNY'S MESSAGE- THESE PEOPLE SPEAKING WITH ONE VOICE. >>. IT IS IMPORTANT TO HEAR THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS NEXT. WHO TAKES UP NAVALNY'S FIGHT? WHO IS THE PERSON THAT IS CARRYING ON WITH THE WORK THAT HE WAS DOING? HIS WIFE HOPES TO STEP IN HIS FOOTSTEPS. SHE DID NOT COME TO RUSSIA. THAT WOULD BE A HUGE RISK FOR HER AS HE PUT HERSELF FRONT AND CENTER IN HER LATE HUSBAND'S LEGACY. >>. Reporter. YEAH, AND SHE IS SOMEBODY THAT VERY WELL MAY BE SEEN AS A RALLYING POINT, A PERSON, A LEADER- SHE SAID IN HER MESSAGE TODAY ON SOCIAL MEDIA THAT I HOPE SHE SPOKE FOR HER LATE HUSBAND. I HOPE YOU WILL BE PROUD OF ME LOOKING DOWN ON ME FROM THERE. WHAT SHE CAN DO, WHAT ANYONE CAN DO AT THIS STAGE. WE DON'T KNOW SO MUCH UNKNOWN IN RUSSIA WHAT WE KNOW TODAY. IT REALLY WAS A HISTORICAL MOMENT. >>. THANK YOU FOR YOUR REPORTING ON THIS ISSUE THROUGHOUT THE WEEKS AND THE MONTHS THAT HAVE BEEN KEIR THANKS. >>>. COMING UP A WILD RESCUE IN KENTUCKY. OH, LOOK AT THAT. THAT IS A TRUCK DANGLING OFF OF A BRIDGE. WE WILL TELL YOU HOW FIRST RESPONDERS MANAGED TO SAVE THE DRIVER. INCREDIBLE STORY >>>. PLUS ELON MUSK SUING AN AI COMPANY. HE HELPED START. HE CLAIMS IT IS NOT LIVING UP TO ITS ORIGINAL MISSION. COMIN >>>. A DRAMATIC SCENE TODAY, WITH FIRST RESPONDERS RESCUING THE DRIVER OF A BIG RIG AS IT WAS DANGLING OFF OF A BRIDGE IN KENTUCKY. ALL OF THIS GOING DOWN LATE TODAY. THIS IS IT. YOU SEE THE CAB. THAT IS THE MOMENT THAT THE DRIVER LOOK AT THAT. THEY ARE PULLING HIM OUT OF THE DRIVER'S SIDE WINDOW. HE IS CLINGING TO THIS GUY, THIS RESCUER, WHO HAS BEEN LOWERED ON A ROPE. THE DRIVER IS GRABBING HIM. THE ARE RESCUER GRABS THE DRIVER. THEY ARE BOTH PULLED BACK UP AND HOISTED BACK ON TO THE BRIDGE TO SAFETY. YOU SAW IT THERE, THE CAB OF THE TRUCK ATTACHED TO THE TRAILER, EVEN AFTER IT WENT OVER THE SIDE. IT IS SO TERRIFYING TO LOOK AT THIS, TO THINK ABOUT THIS AND TO HAVE A SENSE OF THE JUST INCREDIBLE NATURE OF THE RESCUE TO SAVE THIS DRIVER. TELL US ABOUT IT, WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT WHAT, HOW THE DRIVER IS DOING. YES, I THINK THE THING THAT COMES TO MIND WHEN YOU SEE THE MIDGE IS THE DRIVER OKAY, AND THE AUTHORITIES SAY THAT SHE DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE ANY LIFE-THREATENING INJURIESA. THE THIS POINT TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL AS A PRECAUTION. SHE WAS ALERT, ACCORDING TO THE AUTHORITIES, TALKING TO FIRST RESPONDERS AS THEY WERE BEGINNING THIS RESCUE PROCESS. AS YOU MENTIONED, SOMEONE WAS ABLE TO REPEL DOWN THERE, GET HER OUT SAFELY. THE TRUCK IS NOW BEING ARE REMOVE FRIDAY. THE AREA THAT IS SAN ONGOING SITUATION- THAT BRIDGE UNDERSTANDABLY REMAINS CLOSED. THERE ARE TWO OTHER PEOPLE. THIS IS A MULTIVEHICLE COLLISION. THE AUTHORITIES SAY THERE ARE TWO OTHER PEOPLE WHO DO HAVE INJURIES THAT APPEAR TO BE LIFE- THREATENING. THAT IS SOMETHING. WE ARE KEEPING AN EYE ON YOU. HOPE THEIR CONDITIONS IMPROVE. THIS IS AN INCIDENT INVOLVING FOUR VEHICLES. ACCORDING TO THE AUTHORITIES, THEY GET ON THE SCENE WITHIN MINUTES OF GETTING THE CALL AND IT TAKES 40 MINUTES TO GET THIS WOMAN BEHIND THE WHEEL OF THIS SEMI TRUCK, OUT AND BACK TO SAFETY. WE HEARD FROM THE FIREFIGHTER THE MAN WHO WENT IN THERE REPELLED DOWN AND HELPED GET HER OUT. HERE IS PART OF WHAT HE SHARED EARLIER >>. WE DEFINITELY HAVE DONE A FEW CRAZY THINGS. THIS TOPS IT. SO FAR, LIKE I SAID WE TRAIN FOR THIS SITUATION 100 TIMES BUT TO PUT IT IN TACKS FELT GOOD A SUCCESSFUL RESCUE, AND NOW WE GO BACK AND WE DO IT AGAIN IF WE HAVE TO >>. HE IS AS WHEN HE GOT TO HER SHE WAS PRAYING AND HE SAID HE PRAYED WITH HER AS WELL. REMARKABLE SITUATION. SHE IS NOW SAFELY ON LAND WE ARE TOLD, DOES NOT HAVE ANY LIFE THREATENING INJURIES. THERE ARE THOSE TWO OTHER PEOPLE WHO DO HAVE MORE SERIOUS INJURIES AND THAT OOH PEERS TO BE SOMETHING WE ARE KEEPING AN EYE ON. >>. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT. >>>. LET'S GET YOU OVER TO THE FIVE THINGS OUR TEAM THINKS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT TONIGHT. NUMBER ONE: PROSECUTORS CHARGING A 68-YEAR-OLD MAN WITH TWA COUNTS OF MURDER, AFTER SHOOTING FOUR PEOPLE. THE SUSPECT KILLED THE COURT EMPLOYEE THAT TRIED TO SERVE THE NOTICE, ALONG WITH THE RESPONDING OFFICER. TWO OTHER OFFICERS ARE EXPECTED TO BE OKAY. MORE CHARGES, THE FACIALS SAY, WILL BE COMING HERE >>>. NUMBER 2, HUNDREDS OF JOINING THE FUNERAL FOR THE NURSING STUDENT WHO WAS KILLED, NURSING STUDENT WHO WAS KILLED WHILE OUT FOR A JOB. NUMBER 3,: CV S AND WALGREENS WILL BE SELLING THE ABORTION PILL. THEY ARE GOING TO EXPAND TO OTHER PLACES WHERE IT IS LEGAL. IT COMES AS THE SUPREME COURT IS SET TO CONSIDER A CHALLENGE TO THE PILL LATER ON THIS MONTH >>>. NUMBER 4,: CALIFORNIA: GOVERNOR I DENYING PANARA BREAD. IT DOES NOT RELATE TO PLACES THAT MAKE BREAD ON SITE T COULD BE, BECAUSE THEY DONATED TO NEWSOM'S CAMPAIGN- HIS TEAM CALLING THE STORY ABSURD NUMBER 5,. OFFICIALS IN PARIS SAY: LET'S TRY TO EASE UP ON THE TRAFFIC RESTRICTIONS DURING THE OLYMPICS THIS SUMMER. AFTER THEY MET WITH LOCAL REPS. IT IS MEANT TO HELP THE LIVES OF THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE, TRYING TO KEEP THEM. YOU KNOW. HOW CAN IT NOT BE A PAIN? THE FOLKS THAT LIVE THERE YEAR AROUND AND MAKING THE SUMMER OLYMPICS, MAKING IT EASY. LET'S SEE IF IT IS A REALITY. >>>. THE S&P500 AND THE NASDAQ AGAIN RECORDS THE HIGHEST LEVELS EVER. WHY? WELL, LARGELY BECAUSE OF AI STOCKS. WE TALKED ABOUT THE CHIP MAKER THERE, ALL OF THE AI IN THE LEGAL BATTLE OF THE TECH TITAN, ELON MUSK SUING ONE EFFORT BIGGEST PLAYERS IN THE SPACE. OPEN AI AND ITS CEO MUSK SAYS IT HAS ABANDONED THE COMPANY'S FOUNDING MISSION OF DEVELOPING AI FOR THE BENEFIT OF HUMANITY BROODILY AND HE JUST WORKS TO BRING IN BIG PROFITS FOR MICROSOFT. HE WAS ONE OF THE FOUNDERS BACK IN 2015.. NO COMMENT FROM OPEN AI OR ITS PARENT COMPANY, MOSQUEMUSK. ISN'T HE TRYING TO GET HIS OWN AI OFF OF THE GROUND NOW? >>. YES, T IS CALLED XAI, THE REASON HE IS SUING NOW BY THE WAY PEOPLE ARE WONDERING. HE LEFT THE BOARD IN 2018. IT IS BECAUSE OF THE RELEASE OF CHAT GPT4.. HE SAID OPEN AI THAT HE FOUNDED WITH SAM ALTMAN. THE WHOLE THING WAS OPEN. THE IDEA WAS TO PUT CODE OUT THERE AND MAKE SURE IT IS NONPROFIT, WHERE PEOPLE COULD SEE EXACTLY HOW THE AI WAS DEVELOPED FOR THE PURPOSES OF HUMANITY. HIS ARGUMENT IS THAT THE RELEASE LAST YEAR WAS DONE SECRETLY. THIS IS IN A LAWSUIT: GPT FORGED INTERNAL DESIGN WAS KEPT AND REMAINS A COMPLETE SECRET. BUT TO OPEN AI AND ON INFORMATION AND BELIEF- MICROSOFT IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE HERE. THE LAWSUIT IS AGAINST OPEN AI AND SAM ALLOTMAN, BUT HE IS TAKING BLAME AT MICROSOFT. IT IS ON INFORMATION AND BELIEF. HOW MUCH MICROSOFT GETS ROPED INTO IT WILL BE AN INTERESTING THREAD. >>. MICROSOFT REPORTEDLY INVESTED $13 BILLION IN OPEN AI. THAT IS THE NUMBER GOING AROUND HERE. THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH. YOU KNOW PARTNERS IN OTHER COUNTRIES. CLEARLY, THEY ARE HITTING THE GAP ON AI. TALK US THROUGH EVEN IN THE MARKETS TODAY. AI DRIVING THE BIG GAINS FOR THE NASDAQ, FOR THE S&P- CLEARLY. IT IS HERE TO STAY. IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER. IT WAS PART OF A DISCUSSION FOR THE STOCK MARKET. A LOT OF THE INVESTORS ARE SAYING IT IS DRIVING A LOT OF THE GAINS AROUND AI, GOOGLE, FACEBOOK. THE GEMENI LAUNCH WAS OFF BUT MICROSOFT IS TRYING TO TAKE THE LEAD WITH OPEN AI. THAT IS SO THE FRONT OF THIS DEVELOPMENT. BUT HERE IS THE QUESTION: IF ELON MUSK CAN TRIP THEM UP WITH THIS LAWSUIT SAYING THEY DID NOT FOLLOW THE RULES OF THEIR INCORPORATION BY DOING THESE TYPE OF BACKDOOR DEVELOPMENTS, SO HE ALLEGES WITH THESE PRODUCTS, SO MAYBE THAT WOULD ALLOW HIS XAI AT SOME POINT TO TAKE THE LEAD HERE WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THIS LAWSUIT IS NOT SOMETHING WHERE MUSK NEEDS THE MONEY. HE IS VERY WEALTHY ALREADY. THE QUESTION IS IF IT CHANGES THE LEADERBOARD IN THE RACE FOR DEVELOPING THIS SMART TECHNOLOGY THAT IS GETTING MARTYR BY THE MINUTE. HALLIE >> IT SURE IS: THANK YOU VERY MUCH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >>> A LOT MORE TO GET TO HERE IN THE SHOW, INCLUDING NIKKI HALEY ONE-ON-ONE, THE SINGLE BIGGEST NIGHT OF THE REPUBLICANS SO FAR. >>> WHAT FORCED A PRIVATE PLANE THAT A GRAMMY WINNER WAS IN TO? >>> THERE IS LATE BREAKING NEWS >> ALL RIGHT. >>> A FEW DAYS TO GO BEFORE THE BIGGEST PRIMARY NIGHT OF THE ELECTION YEAR SO FAR. VERY POSSIBLY NIKKI HALEY'S LAST STAND. WE DON'T KNOW, BUT MAYBE VOTERS IN 15 STATES- THOSE 15 STATES IN YELLOW WILL HEAD TO THE POLLS ON SUPER TUESDAY AND HALEY, AS YOU KNOW, STILL IN THIS THING. SHE HAS NOT WON A SINGLE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY CONTEST SO FAR. HOPING TO CHANGE THAT TUESDAY, SHE DID JUST PICK UP HER FIRST SENATE ENDORSEMENT FROM ALASKA. REPUBLICAN ALASKA WAS ONE OF THE STATES ON THE MAP THERE VOTING ON SUPER TUESDAY. KRISTEN WELKER GOING ONE-ON-ONE EXCLUSIVELY WITH HALEY TODAY AND HALEY SOUNDING THE ALARM ABOUT WHAT SHE THINKS OF A SECOND TRUMP TERM LISTEN. >>. DO YOU THINK DONALD TRUMP WOULD FOLLOW THE CONSTITUTION IF HE WAS ELECTED TO A SECOND TERM? >> I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN YOU ALWAYS WANT TO THINK SOMEONE WILL, BUT I DON'T KNOW WHEN YOU GO IN AND YOU TALK ABOUT REVENGE. WHEN YOU GO AND YOU TALK ABOUT VINDICATION. WHEN YOU GO AND TALK ABOUT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS AND ONLY HE CAN ANSWER FOR THAT. WHAT I CAN ANSWER FOR IS: I DON'T THINK THERE SHOULD EVER BE A PRESIDENT THAT IS: IS ABUFF THE LAW. I DON'T THINK THERE EVER SHOULD BE A PRESIDENT THAT HAS TOTAL IMMUNITY TO DO WHATEVER THEY WANT TO DO. I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE SOMEONE THAT OUR KIDS CAN LOOK UP TO, THAT THEY CAN BE PROUD OF, AND I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE A COUNTRY OF LAW AND ORDER, A COUNTRY OF FREEDOM AND A COUNTRY THAT GOES BACK TO RESPECTING THE VALUE OF A TAXPAYER DOLLAR. WE DON'T HAVE ANY OF THAT. RIGHT NOW. >>. FRESH OFF OF THAT INTERVIEW IS KRISTEN WELKER JOINING US NOW. HERE IS HALEY RIGHT >> RIGHT >>. TRYING TO MAKE HER CLOSING ARGUMENT A BIG DEAL NIGHT FOR HER. MAYBE THE LAST TIME WE SEE HER TALK US THROUGH SOME OF THE TAKEAWAYS. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF WHAT SHE TOLD YOU >>. IT WAS A STUNNING MOMENT. SHE PAUSED AND THROUGHOUT ABOUT IT AND GAVE THAT >>. YES, ALWAYS THINKING ABOUT THINGS IS GOOD >>. Reporter. YES, YOU CAN TELL. THIS IS A SERIOUS, FRANKLY A CANDID MOMENT. FRANKLY A CANDID MOMENT. SHE HAS BEEN SHARPENING WHAT SHE HAS BEEN SAYING. SHE SEEMS UNDETOURED. SHE HAS NOT WON ANY STATEMENTS. I PRESSED HER ON THIS. ARE YOU IN THIS TO JUST MAKE THE CASE FOR YOUR VISION OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY? SHE DID NOT DENY IT IS IN SOME WAYACE. I FIGHT FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY BUT SHE SAYS SHE IS NOT ANTITRUMP, WHAT IS NOTABLE. OBVIOUSLY, HIS LEGAL BATTLES ARE LOOMING OVER ALL OF US. IN THE PRIMARY, YOU AND I DISCUSSED THIS >> ENDLESSLY >>. YES, IT HAS ONLY EMBOLDENED HIM IF HE IS IN THE ELECTION. I ASKED HER, IF SHE WANTS TO SEE ALL OF HIS CASES, GO TO TRIAL >>. I THINK ALL OF THE CASES SHOULD BE DEALT WITH BEFORE NOVEMBER. WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN BEFORE THE PRECEDENCY HAPPENS, BECAUSE AFTER THAT, SHOULD HE BECOME PRESIDENT, I DON'T THINK ANY OF US ARE GOING TO GET HEARD. I DON'T THINK A PRESIDENT SHOULD BE IMMUNED FROM ANYTHING IMMUNE. HE IS ASKING FOR THINGS NO PRESIDENT EVER ASKED FOR. I HOPE THEY RULE QUICKLY AND MAKE THEIR DECISION, BUT THEY NEED TO. >>. THAT WAS NOTABLE. ALSO, THEY NEED TO GO TO TRIAL BEFORE ELECTION. THAT WAS AT AN EVENT, THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. IF YOU WILL A LITTLE CLOSE TO WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW. >>. 30 MINUTES AWAY FROM THE BUREAU THAT STILL COUNTS >>. WHAT IS INTERESTING. SHE IS GETTING MORE AND MORE INTENSE ABOUT HER WARNINGS. WHAT A DONALD TRUMP TERM WOULD MEAN >>. OKAY, A LITTLE TEASE FOR WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO SEE ON SUNDAY. I ASKED FOR THAT A NUMBER OF TIMES YOU WILL HAVE TO SEE IT ON SUNDAY. IF SHE GIVES A ANSWER, THAT IS REALLY THE QUESTION. RIGHT, IS SHE GOING TO BACK HIM AFTER ALL OF THIS? I CAN TELL YOU IN TALKING TO A NUMBER OF REPUBLICANS WHO SAID, YES, SHE HAS TO, BECAUSE SHE HAS A POLITICAL FUTURE. I ASKED HER ABOUT HOW SHE SEES HER POLITICAL FUTURE AS WELL AND >>. ON THE NATIONAL STAGE: YES, IF SHE TRIES AGAIN IN 2028.. >> RIGHT >>. THE QUESTION IS- I GO BACK TO YOUR POINT- HER ATTACKS HAVE GOTTEN SHARPER. HOW DOES SHE WIN BACK THE TRUMP VOTERS IN SHE WERE TO RUN IN 2028.. IT COMES BACK. WE TALK ABOUT THIRD PARTY STUFF. WE TALK ABOUT IVF AND A LITTLE FOREIGN POLICY. >> FASCINATING TOPICS. WE WILL BE TUNING IN SUNDAY MORNING. I WILL SEE YOU 100% ON SUNDAY. >>. THANK YOU, APPRECIATE YOU. >> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. >>. MORE ON ""MEET THE PRESS"" AND MORE FROM MRS WELKER AND MYSELF ON TUESDAY. SEVEN HOURS OF IT- GET READY, STARTING AT 5:00 EASTERN. HOWEVER YOU ARE WATCHING NOW AND ON NBC NEWS >>>. NBC COVERS HUNDREDS OF STORIES T CAN BE TOUGH TO READ AND WATCH AND LISTEN TO THEM. ALL OUR BUREAU TEAMS HAVE DONE IT FOR YOU. THIS IS WHAT THEY SAY IS DOING DOWN FOR THEM. NORTHEAST BUREAU- THE NEW YORK MAN ACCUSED OF KILLING A 20- YEAR-OLD. AFTER SHE ACCIDENTALLY PULLED INTO HIS DRIVEWAY, GETTING SENTENCED 25 YEARS TO LIFE. THE JUDGE HANDING DOWN THE MAX SENTENCE. HE DID NOT SHOW REMORSE. THE DEFENSE SAID THEY WILL APPEAL. >>>. A PRIVATE PLANE CARRYING CAROL G MAKING AN EMERGENCY, LANDING AT AN AIRPORT IN LA. THE FLIGHT TOOK OFF, BUT THE PILOT HAD TO TURN AROUND AFTER NOTICING SMOKE IN THE COCKPIT, A DOZEN PEOPLE ON BOARD, BUT NOBODY WAS HURT. >>> OUT OF THE NORTHEAST BUREAU LAST YEAR. LAST YEAR'S LOBSTER CATCH, DROPPING TO THE LOWEST IT HAS BEEN IN MORE THAN A DECADE. THE SECOND YEAR IN A ROW IT HAS GONE DOWN. WHY? ONE REASON: NEW RULES AGAINST LOBSTER FISHING GEAR THAT COULD TANGLE UP AND ENDANGER WHALES. THE OTHER REASON: CLIMATE CHANGE >>> PUSHING TO END LEGACY ADMISSIONS. WHY CHANGES IN ONE? >>> NEWS FOR THE GENERATION OF NOW IS NBC NEWS NOW. >>> TONIGHT ORIGINAL, NOW IN DEPTH REPORTING ON A TOPIC WE HAVE BEEN WATCHING TONIGHT BATTLE OVER COLLEGE ADMISSION. RIGHT NOW IN CONNECTICUT, LAWMAKERS ARE LOOKING TO END LEGACY ADMISSIONS. LIKE YOU KNOW, IF YOU GET INTO A SCHOOL BECAUSE A RELATIVE WENT THERE, THEY WANT TO END IT, NOT JUST FOR STATE SCHOOLS BUT FOR PRIVATE SCHOOLS TOO. A QUESTION OF FAIRNESS FOR SCHOOLS. LIKE YALE OF COURSE IN CONNECTICUT SAY IT IS NOT FAIR >>. Reporter- POTENTIAL FIRST OUT OF CONNECTICUT, THE STATE, TRYING TO END ONE OF THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL PRACTICES IN HIGHER EDUCATION: LEGACY ADMISSIONS. THAT IS WHEN A COLLEGE GIVES PREFERENCE TO AN ALUM'S CHILD, GRAND CHILD, SIBLING ANY RELATIVE OVER ANOTHER CANDIDATE. COLORADO BANS THE PRACTICE FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS BACK IN 2021.. STATES LIKE CALIFORNIA, NEW YORK, MARYLAND, VIRGINIA AND MASSACHUSETTS ARE THINKING ABOUT THEIR OWN BANS CONGRESS IS TOO. THIS COMES AFTER THE SUPREME COURT CONSERVATIVE MAJORITY BROUGHT RACE BASED ADMISSIONS IN RULING AGAINST HARVARD AND UNIVERSITY OF CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL. CONNECTICUT WANTS TO TAKE IT ONE STEP FURTHER, PUSHING TO END IT AT PRIVATE SCHOOLS TOO. >>. IT IS AN ISSUE OF FAIRNESS. IT IS IMPORTANT AFTER THE SUPREME COURT DECISION LAST YEAR >>. Reporter. WE ASKED DEMOCRATIC STATE SENATOR WHO RUNS CONNECTICUT'S STATE EDUCATION COMMITTEE WHY HE THINKS SCHOOLS LIKE YALE SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO STATE LAW. HE SAYS IT IS BECAUSE OF TAXES. >> YALE, THEY WOULD PAY- I SAW A REPORT- $90 MILLION MORE A YEAR IN PROPERTY TAXES IF THEY WERE NOT GRANTED NONPROFIT STATUS. AS A RESULT, ALL OF US PAY MORE IN TAXES. RIGHT, SO THE SCHOOL CAN AVOID PAYING TAXES AND YOU KNOW THAT IS OKAY. THAT IS WHAT WE ESTABLISHED. THEY ARE NONPROFITS. THAT MEANS THEY HAVE TO OPERATE WITH THE PUBLIC GOOD IN MIND >>. Reporter. WE ASKED YALE. IF THEY WOULD END LEGACY ADMISSIONS, THEY WOULD NOT RESPOND. SO FAR, ONE PRIVATE SCHOOL HAS AGREED TO END LEGACY ADMISSIONS. THE CONNECTICUT CONFERENCE OF INDEPENDENT COLLEGES THAT REPRESENTS THE STATE'S 15 PRIVATE UNIVERSITIES TOLD OUR TEAM IT OPPOSES THCONCEPT OF STATE LEGISLATION PROHIBITING INDEPENDENT COLLEGES IN CONNECTICUT FROM GETTING PREFERENCE TO LEGACY STUDENTS. BANNING THEM WILL NOT MOVE THE NEEDLE ON PROMOTING EQUITY. BUT MANY SCHOOLS SEEM TO DISAGREE, ACCORDING TO NEW DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DATA, ESPECIALLY OUT WEST. ENTIRE STATES DO NOT HAVE SCHOOLS THAT CONSIDER LEGACY, AND A HUGE SHIFT IN JUST FOUR YEARS. JUST OVER A QUARTER OF FOUR-YEAR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE COLLEGES CONSIDER LEGACY, STATUS DOWN FROM HALF IN 2020.. BUT MORE SELECTIVE SCHOOLS ARE HOLDING TIGHTER TO THE PRACTICE: 57% OF THEM STILL CONSIDER LEGACY. THEY SAY IT IS A HUGE ISSUE >>. SO THEY HAVE AN ENORMOUS IMPACT ON OUR SOCIETY, THESE SCHOOLS, AND IT IS REALLY A TICKET TO THE ELITE WE ALL HAVE, I THINK, A STAKE IN MAKING SURE THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE WEALTHY TO GO TO ONE OF THESE SCHOOLS >>. Reporter. AND THAT IS WHAT THE DATA SHOWS. RIGHT NOW THE MOST SELECTIVE SCHOOLS: 30% OF LEGACY APPLICANTS COME FROM THE TOP 1%. TWO THIRDS FROM THE RICHEST 5%. EXPERTS LIKE JAMES MURPHY AT EDUCATION REFORM NOW SAY: THE BACKLASH. NATIONWIDE IS NOW BIPARTISAN >>. THEY BOTH UNDERSTAND HOW UNFAIR IT IS. >>. Reporter. ONE CATCH: IF YALE DECIDES TO END IT, THEY WILL NOT PENALIZE THEM. THEY SAY: THE POLITICAL PRESSURE IS ENOUGH. >>. MY EXPECTATION ARE: THEY ARE LAW-ABIDING CONSTITUTIONS. THEY WANT TO BE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE LAW AND ONCE THEY DO, IT WILL DROP THEM. >>>. IT SOUNDS LIKE THE VIBE YOU ARE GETTING. IT IS NOT A CONNECTICUT THING, IT IS REALLY HEADED TOWARDS A MOVEMENT MORE BROODILY ACROSS THE COUNTRY. >>. SOME PEOPLE ARE SAYING: FAIR IS FAIR. IF THE SUPREME COURT SAYS THAT THERE CAN NOT BE ADMISSIONS BASED ON RACE, THEN HOW IS IT ON LEGACY THAT BENEFITS WEALTHY WHITE STUDENTS. SO MONEY IS ALWAYS SOMETHING. THEY WILL BE PERSUASIVE. IN FACT, IN CALIFORNIA A COUPLE ASSEMBLYMAN ARE SAYING TO PRIVATE UNIVERSITIES WHO ARE GETTING MONEY FROM CAL STATE PROGRAMMING: IF THEY CONTINUE LEGACY ADMISSIONS, THEY MIGHT LOSE THE FUNDING. IT IS PUBLIC FUNDING. LOS ANGELES TIMES NEWSPAPER DID A SPOT THAT SAID IT COULD BE SOMETHING LIKE $26.6 MILLION. THEY CAN LOSE. THAT MIGHT BE PERSUASIVE. >>. AFTER ALL OF THAT, AN THAT IS A REP FOR THIS HOUR. MORE COVERAGE PICKS UP RIGHT. MORE COVERAGE PICKS UP RIGHT NOW. >>>. MARCH MAY BE MAKING HISTORY. >>> MARCH MAY BE MAKING HISTORY ALREADY. LOOK AT THIS. WE ARE SEEING CRASHES, CONCERNS ABOUT AVALANCHES, INTENSE MOMENTS BETWEEN THE FEET OF SNOW AND THESE THOUSANDS OF ACRES OF FIRES. IN TEXAS, PRESIDENT BIDEN LATE TODAY SAYING THE US WILL AIRDROP FOOD INTO GAZA, PULLING OUT EVERY STOP, TO GET HELP TO THE INNOCENT PEOPLE THERE WHO NEED IT. AND A POTENTIAL CEASE-FIRE PLUS TWO CASES AGAINST DONALD TRUMP. THAT COULD DETERMINE WHEN OR IF HE GOES TO TRIAL. WE ARE LIVE OUTSIDE OF BOTH COURTROOMS, A RARE SHOW OF DEFIANCE. THOUSANDS SHOWING UP THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE FOR ALEXEI NAVALNY'S FUNERAL. THOUSANDS OF THEM GOT ARRESTED. WHEN HIS WIFE IS SAYING TODAY: >>>. IN KENTUCKY, A DRIVER GETTING RESCUED OFF THE SIDE OF A BRIDGE- HOW THIS EVEN HAPPENED IN THE FIRST PLACE. WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT. THAT IS LATER IN THE SHOW. HEY, THERE I AM HAILLE. THE BIGGEST SNOWSTORM WE'VE SEEN THIS YEAR IS POUNDING THE WEST. IT IS TOUGH TO UNDERSTAND HOW BAD IT IS. IMAGINE LOOKING THROUGH YOUR WINDSHIELD AND SING THIS: ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. OFFICIALS SAY: IF YOU HAVEN'T LEFT BY NOW, DON'T EVEN BOTHER, DON'T EVEN BOTHER TO TRY TO GET OUT. YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THE DAMAGE HERE. UP HIGH ARE ON THE MOUNTAINS. THE CONDITIONS ARE EVEN WORSE. THEY ARE NOW AT THEIR HIGHEST POSSIBLE LEVEL. HERE'S A LIVE LOOK RIGHT NOW AT THE SNOW ROUTE. YOU CAN SEE IT HERE. THE SNOW IS COMING DOWN. IT'S POSSIBLE. YOU CAN SEE TOTALS OF UP TO 12 FEET. IMAGINE ME, ANOTHER ME- STACKED ON TOP AND THEN MORE. ON TOP OF THAT, THEY WILL HAVE REALLY INTENSE WINDS, UP TO 100 MILES AN HOUR. THATS ON TOP OF THIS OTHER POTENTIAL WEATHER DISASTER. YOU SEE HERE A HUGE, DEADLY WILDFIRE, BLANKETING PARTS OF THE PANHANDLE. IT IS GETTING WINDIER AND WARMER THERE. THAT MAKES IT THAT MUCH MORE HEART TO -- QUAD VANEGAS IN TEXAS. WE WILL START THINGS WITH YOU. >>. Reporter. YES, CONDITIONS HERE ARE RAPIDLY DETERIORATING AFTER, AFTER, HOUR AND THE BIG BANG. THE WIND IS PICKING UP AND THIS IS SHUT DOWN. THIS IS ONE OF MANY SKI RESORTS IN THIS AREA. WE KNOW IT IS COMING. WE WILL GO AHEAD AND THROW IN THE TOWEL, A LOT OF RESIDENTS DOING THE SAME. THIS IS EXPECTED TO BE ALL MOMENTOUS SNOW EVENT. IT CAN CAUSE SEVERE DAMAGE, LOCKING PEOPLE IN PLACE FOR DAYS. YOU GO UP HIGH ENOUGH. YOU ARE TALKING: 15-16 FEET OF SNOW COMING IN 100, 110, 120 MILES PER HOUR. IT IS STILL BAD. MAYBE 3-4 FEET OF SNOW WHERE I'M STANDING. THIS IS A BLIZZARD WARNING. 1 OF ONLY 8 ISSUED SINCE 2002.. PEOPLE IN THIS AREA ARE USED TO IT. THE LAST ONE WE HAD WAS ALMOST EXACTLY A YEAR AGO. ROOFS WERE CAVING IN BECAUSE FOUR FEET OF SNOW WAS ON PEOPLE'S HOUSES. THEY WERE TRAPPED FOR DAYS. RESIDENTS ARE STEPPING UP GATHERING FOOD WHATEVER THEY CAN TO HUNKER DOWN OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS, OR SO LIKE I-80, YOU WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO MOVE IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS, SENDING IT BACK TO YOU. >>. THANKS TO STEVE PATTERSON FOR THAT REPORTING. LOOK AT THIS WHAT YOU ARE SEEING ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF YOUR SCREEN. THOSE ARE WILDFIRES IN TEXAS. THEY HAVE TURNED DEADLY, KILLING AT LEAST TWO PEOPLE IN THE STATE. IT IS ONLY ABOUT 50% CONTAINED QUAD. THERE HAS BEEN SO MUCH DAMAGE TALK ABOUT HOW PEOPLE ARE BRACING FOR WHAT IS NEXT. SOME ARE TRYING TO GET BACK TO SEE WHAT IS LEFT. >>. Reporter HAILLE, IT WILL GET WINDY AND HOT. YESTERDAY I WAS STANDING DOWN THE STREET AND IT WAS RAINING. IT WAS ICY. THAT WAS AN HOUR. AFTER IT WAS SNOWING DOWN THE ROAD IN ANOTHER AREA, HERE IN THE PANHANDLE, YOU CAN SEE HOW THE WEATHER CHANGES SO MUCH. THAT IS WHAT EXPERTS TELL ME AND THAT IS WHAT THE OFFICIALS HEARSAY. THE TEXAS PANHANDLE IS KNOWN FOR THOSE CRAZY WINTER CHANGES. IT WAS THE CHANGE IN THE WIND THAT INITIALLY MADE THIS WILDFIRE SO BAD. THIS IS THE CREEK FIRE, THE ONE THAT IS BURNING OVER 1 MILLION ACRES- THE LARGEST IN TEXAS STATE HISTORY YOU CAN SEE ONE OF THE PROPERTIES BEHIND ME THAT BURNED DOWN, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT ALSO HAS AUTHORITIES HERE WORRIED THE FACT THAT A LOT OF THESE AREAS THAT BURNED THEY STILL HAVE HOTSPOTS. IT WOULD REQUIRE DAYS OF RAIN FOR THOSE HOTSPOTS TO BE COMPLETELY PUT OUT. WITH THOSE TEMPERATURES INCREASING, THEY ARE VIGILANT. SOME OF THESE SPOTS COULD LIGHT UP AGAIN ONCE THE TEMPERATURE RISES A LOT MORE. WE WILL GET THAT WIND BACK IN HALEY. >>. IT IS THE BIGGEST IN THAT STATE BUT IT IS ALSO THE LARGEST OF ANY WILDFIRE WE HAVE ON RECORD IN CALIFORNIA. RIGHT, YOU HAVE COVERED, AS WE KNOW, MANY FIRES OVER THE YEAR IN CALIFORNIA. I WONDER IF YOU CAN REFLECT THE EXPERIENCES VERSUS HERE. >>. CALIFORNIA HAS A LOT OF WILDFIRES, THE RESOURCES THAT EXIST THERE. IT IS MUCH WIDER. THE AREAS ARE SPREAD IN A DIFFERENT WAY. TO START OFF, THE RESOURCES THAT EXIST, VERSUS THE RESOURCES IN TEXAS ALSO, BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE AS MANY WILDFIRES. HERE. TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PLACES, THE WEATHER CHANGES THAT I'VE SEEN HERE IN THE PANHANDLE. I HAVE NEVER SEEN THIS IN CALIFORNIA FOUR YEARS. YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF DIFFERENCES IN THESE TWO DIFFERENT PLACES. WHAT YOU DO HAVE HERE, LIKE IN OTHER PLACES, IT IS THE VEGETATION WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY THE FIELD THAT THE WILDFIRE IS REQUIRED TO KEEP EXPANDING. WE HAVE GOVERNOR GREG ABBOTT IN THE PANHANDLE TODAY SPEAKING ABOUT THE DAMAGE WE HAVE SEEN. THIS IS WHAT HE HAD TO SAY: >> NO ONE CAN LET DOWN THEIR GUARD. EVERYONE MUST REMAIN VERY VIGILANT. >>. THE GOVERNOR ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE FIREFIGHTERS THAT WERE HURT. HE SAYS THERE WERE THE THREE FIREFIGHTERS THAT WERE BURNED. THEY ARE AT THE HOSPITAL BEING TREATMENT. HE ALSO MENTIONED THAT THE FIRST ASSIGNMENT INDICATES THAT THEY COULD HAVE THE STRUCTURES. ANOTHER THING THAT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO DEAL WITH IN TEXAS: THE LONG DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ONE END OF THE FIRE. WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ASSESS THE DAMAGE IN ORDER TO GET TO THE NEXT STRUCTURE, MAYBE 20 MILES, THEN THE NEXT ONE OF MAYBE 10 MILES. YOU'VE GOT A BIG AREA THAT AUTHORITIES HAVE TO TRY TO PROTECT AS THEY ASSESS THOSE DAMAGES WHILE THEY PREPARE FOR THIS CHANGE IN AN INTERPRETER'S HAILLE. >> SCOTT VANEGAS, THEIR LIFE. FOR US, THERE IS A LOT TO COVER. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING US THE LATEST BILL KARINS JOINING US NOW. IT IS THE WIND THAT IS A FACTOR IN BOTH OF THESE DISASTERS WE ARE SEEING RIGHT NOW. >> YEAH, IT IS THE WIND WE ARE FEARFUL OF. ALONG WITH THE CHANCE OF THIS INCREDIBLE SNOW EVENT, OUR STORM HAS PRODUCED NUMBER 1-- 2 FEET OF SNOW. THIS IS KIND OF JUST THE APPETIZER THAT WILL GET MORE, MAYBE ABOUT A FOOT TONIGHT, PROBABLY ABOUT ANOTHER FOOT ON TOP OF THAT. THIS IS THE HIGHEST, AT ABOUT 20 INCHES. WE PROBABLY HAVE 60-80 INCHES OF SNOW, MAYBE A LITTLE HIGHER THAN THAT. YOU CAN SEE THE MOISTURE COMING IN OFF THE PACIFIC. THAT IS WHY SEE OUT THE BLUE. HERE WILL ALSO GET A SHOT OF SNOW IN THE NEXT 24 HOURS AND THE MOUNTAINS OF UTAH. AS WE GO THROUGHOUT THE REST OF TODAY AND THROUGH SATURDAY, THE STORM GOES THROUGH. THAT IS MAKING IT COLDER. IT WILL GET FLUFFIER, LIGHTER. IT WILL BLOW AROUND MORE. IT WILL BLOW AROUND MORE INTO SUNDAY. 510 FEET, CASCADES AND IN UTAH THERE ABOUT 1-3 FEET. THIS IS ALL THE WAY DOWN. THE COAST TOWARD, SANTA BARBARA. THIS IS NOT LIKE THE LAST COUPLE OF STORMS, THE MUDSLIDES, DEBRIS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. IT WILL BE AN ANNOYINGLY RAINY SATURDAY NOW. WE'VE ALREADY HEARD HIM SAY IT WAS 70 TODAY. IT WILL BE 70-80 TOMORROW. WE HAVE RED FLAG WARNINGS FROM SOUTH DAKOTA ALL THE WAY DOWN. A GOOD CHUNK OF COLORADO AND NEW MEXICO TOMORROW. THE GREATEST CONCERN HITTING THE DIAMOND IN ALL THE WAY DOWN. THIS IS WHERE WE JUST HAD THE HORRIFIC FIRES. WE WILL WORRY ABOUT THAT FLARING BACK UP. IF IT DOES, IT WILL START BURNING INTO OKLAHOMA, POSSIBLY HERE IN TWO AREAS OF THE PANHANDLE. THIS IS CANADIAN TEXAS WHERE -- LOCATED. THIS IS ALREADY BURNED, THE SMOKEHOUSE CREEK FIRE WITH THESE 30-40 MILE AN HOUR WINDS. THIS WILL TAKE THE BLAZE NORTHWARD. HERE'S THE RAINFALL FORECAST OVER THE NEXT SEVEN DAYS, FOR THE NEXT WEEK, NOTHING. IT WILL BE DRY, AS CAN BE FOR THE WEEKEND FORECAST. WE WILL HAVE AN EYE ON THE AREAS THAT HAS ALREADY HAD THE FIRES AND ANY NEW ONES AT FOREIGN. IF THEY DO, THEY WILL SPREAD RAPIDLY. >>. BILL KARINS, THANK YOU SO MUCH. >>>. LET'S BRING YOU BACK TO WASHINGTON LITERALLY. IN THE LAST FIVE MINUTES, YOU HEARD FROM PRESIDENT BIDEN TELLING OUR TEAM THAT THE US PLAN TO AIRDROPPED FOOD INTO GAZA. IN HIS WORDS, VERY SOON. THERE IS AN URGENCY TO THIS, CONSIDERING A NEW REPORT FROM THE UN OF BABIES IN GAZA DYING FROM MALNUTRITION AND STARVATION. ON THE BACKDROP OF THESE NEW COMETS, GLOBAL OUTRAGE, ISRAEL FACES ACCUSATIONS OF ATTACKING A CROWD OF CIVILIANS IN GAZA CITY- MORE THAN 100 KILLED, HOPING TO GET AID. LET ME EXPLAIN WHAT IS HAPPENED IN THE LAST FIVE MINUTES. HERE, PRESIDENT BIDEN IS HEADING OUT, GOING TO AN AREA OF THE WHITE HOUSE WHERE REPORTERS CAN ASK THEM QUESTIONS ABOUT 10 QUESTIONS PORTING -- ACCORDING TO THE REPORTERS THERE THIS LITERALLY JUST HAPPENED. HE WAS ASKED BY OUR OWN -- WHEN THESE DROPS WOULD BE. HE THINKS PRETTY SOON, HE SPEAKS TO THE URGENCY OF THE MOMENT AND SPEAKS TO HOW MUCH THIS IS FRONT AND CENTER FOR THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION RIGHT NOW >>. Reporter. IT ABSOLUTELY DOES HAILLE, ACCORDING TO REPORTERS WERE OUT THERE. HE WAS ALSO ASKED ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE NEGOTIATIONS, WHETHER HE STILL BELIEVES THERE COULD BE A DEAL. WE ARE JUST ABOUT A WEEK AND A HALF AWAY, HE SAYS. AT THIS POINT HE CAN'T SAY WHETHER THERE WILL BE A DEAL AT ALL. I WANT TO COME TO THE AIRDROPPED THAT THE PRESIDENT IS NOW INDICATING VERY SOON. HE HOPES HE IS MAKING IT VERY CLEAR. THIS IS AN OPTION OF LAST RESORT. THEY DID NOT WANT TO BE IN THE BUSINESS OF DOING AIRDROPPED OVER THE GAZA STRIP. YOU HAD THE NATIONAL SECURITY SPOKESMAN. THE EASIEST WAY TO GET AID IN IS BY TRUCK. ABOUT 500 TRUCKS GOING IN PER DAY. AIRPLANES MAY BE DROPPING 3-4 TRUCKLOADS. THE WHITE HOUSE IS MAKING IT CLEAR THAT EVEN THOUGH. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN HERE FOR A WHILE. THAT INCIDENT: YESTERDAY THE 30 OR SO TRUCKS WERE MAKING THEIR WAY THROUGH THE GAZA STRIP NOW WELL OVER 100 BELIEVING TO BE DEAD. IT IS CONTRIBUTING TO THE SPIRALING HUMANITARIAN CRISIS ON THE GAZA STRIP. THEY HAD TO DO SOMETHING IN ADDITION. WE EXPECT THE FIRST ONE WILL FOCUS REALLY ON FOOD AID. IT IS NOW LOOKING AT TRYING TO GET AID IN THROUGH -- ESSENTIALLY SOME MECHANISM- WHERE THEY COULD BRING ON SHIP. THAT IS A LITTLE BIT FARTHER OFF. CLEARLY, THE US UNDERSTANDS AT THIS POINT THAT THEY ARE ON THE BOARD OF FAMINE, AS THE UN HAS BEEN SAYING FOR WEEKS. NOW IT CONTINUES TO RAISE ABOUT WHY THESE TRUCKS ARE NOT GETTING WHERE THEY NEED TO BE. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, THERE ARE MORE AND MORE GAZANS IN DESPERATE CONDITIONS EVERY DAY BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT GETTING BASIC FOOD, MEDICINE AND WATER. THIS WILL START VERY SOON TO START FLYING THEM OVER THE GAZA STRIP, DROPPING AID TO THOSE WHO NEED IT. >>. THIS IDEA OF A POTENTIAL CEASE-FIRE RAMADAN SAID TO BEGIN SOON. HE WAS ASKED A COUPLE OF TIMES. ARE WE STILL WORKING? ARE WE NOT THERE? HE DOESN'T KNOW. AT THIS POINT, THERE ARE SO MANY QUESTION MARKS, AS IF THERE CAN BE A TEMPORARY TRUCE REACHED TO BE ABLE TO GET THOSE ESTIMATED- 130 ESTIMATED- OUT OF GAZA. >>. THAT IS RIGHT. >>. Reporter. A CHANGE OF TONE FROM PRESIDENT BIDEN, WHO JUST A FEW DAYS AGO SEEMS LIKE HE WAS REALLY OPTIMISTIC. HE WAS TALKING ABOUT A DEAL BY MONDAY, PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE ELSE INVOLVED IN THIS. WE ARE NOT QUITE THERE. YET NOW WOULD SEE THE PRESIDENT SORT OF WALKING BACK THOSE THAT DICTATIONS, AS IT IS VERY CLEAR THAT THERE IS NO -- STILL A WIDE GAP. IF THEY WILL REACH ANY KIND OF DEAL, THAT WILL AGAIN SEE HOSTAGES REACHED, PRISONERS RELEASED AND HOPEFULLY SOME TYPE OF CEASE-FIRE TO COINCIDE WITH THE RAMADAN HOLIDAY >>. AS YOU KNOW FROM YOUR TIME COVERING THE WHITE HOUSE, WE CAN EVEN SHOW YOU SOME OF THIS VIDEO, YET, BECAUSE IT LITERALLY JUST HAPPENED- THERE IS A TEAM OF PEOPLE WORKING. WE WILL SHOW YOU THAT, WHEN WE CAN THANK YOU SO MUCH, GOING THROUGH THOSE HEADLINES WITH US FRESH OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE IN JUST THE LAST COUPLE OF MINUTES, JOSH THANKS. >>>. WITHIN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS, WE MAY KNOW WHETHER THE WHOLE ELECTION INTERFERENCE CASE AGAINST FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP COULD FALL APART. THE JUDGE IS NOW CONSIDERING WHETHER OR NOT TO KICK THE FULTON COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY OFF THE CASE. ALTOGETHER THE COMBINATION OF A DRAMATIC AND CANDIDLY, SOMETIMES FALLACIOUS MISCONDUCT. HEARING AROUND ONE FANI WILLIS- THERE SHE IS IN THE RED IN COURT. DID SHE FINANCIALLY BENEFIT IMPROPERLY FROM A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR SHE HIRED TO WORK ON THIS CASE, NATHAN WADE. MR TRUMP AND HIS CO-DEFENDANTS SAY YES, AND THEY BOTH NEED TO BE REMOVED TO PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF THE COURT. HER TEAM SAYS: WAIT A SECOND, THERE IS NO EVIDENCE. SHE DID ANYTHING WRONG. >>. THERE WAS ZERO EVIDENCE, NOT A SINGLE SHRED OF EVIDENCE TO ANY OF THIS. THE EXHIBITS SHOWING HOW THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS, THEIR DUE PROCESS RIGHTS. THEY WEREN'T AT ALL AFFECTED BY THE RELATIONSHIPS THAT BEGAN IN MARCH OF 2022.. >>. UNDER GEORGIA LAW, IF THE JUDGE DECIDES THAT WILLIS SHOULD BE KICKED OFF THE CASE, THAT THE DA SHOULD BE KICKED OFF, IT WOULD GO TO ANOTHER PROSECUTOR. IT IS NOT AT ALL CERTAIN THAT ANY OTHER PROSECUTOR WILL TAKE IT UP. THE CASE AGAINST FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IN GEORGIA COULD DISSOLVE. --. IN ATLANTA WE HEARD THE ARGUMENT FROM THE DA TEAM. THE DEFENSE IS DRILLING INTO SOMETHING THAT FANI. WILLIS TALKED ABOUT A LOT THAT SHE OFTEN USED CASH TALK TO US ABOUT THAT. >>. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS, I THINK AT ONE POINT- AN EXAMPLE OF THIS VERY TOPIC, WHEN WE WERE LOOKING AT THE CREDIT CARD STATEMENTS. THAT REVEALS A LOT OF REALLY PERSONAL, SOMETIMES INTERESTING DETAILS. THAT HAS BEEN THE CROSS OF A LOT OF THE IN ARGUMENTS. IN TERMS OF THE STATE THEY ARE SAYING: CREDIT CARD STATEMENTS DON'T PAINT THE FULL PICTURE. OBVIOUSLY A CREDIT CARD. OBVIOUSLY A CREDIT CARD STATEMENT WOULD NOT REFLECT CLAIMING THE OPPOSITE. AND SAYING THAT THERE WERE $9200 REMAINING UNACCOUNTED FOR CLAIMING THAT THE $9200 WAS THE AMOUNT OF MONEY IN PART THAT SHE ENJOYED. TAKE A LISTEN TO SOME WORDS WE HEARD TODAY FROM THE ATTORNEY REPRESENTING MICHAEL ROMAN WHO FILED THE MOTION: >> YOU ARE PUBLIC OFFICIAL, REQUIRED TO KEEP TRACKS OF GIFTS YOU RECEIVED. YOU NEED TO KEEP TRACK OF IT. THERE IS NO PAPER TRAIL. >>. THEY LIVED THESE LIFESTYLES, RICH AND FAMOUS. THEY DID THIS WRITING ON THE BACKS OF THE DEFENDANTS IN THIS CASE FUNDED BY THE TAXPAYERS OF FULTON COUNTY SMITH. I WILL END WITH THIS. IT IS NO LONGER A QUESTION OF SPECULATION, OF WHETHER MONEY CHANGES. THE REMAINING QUESTION REMAINS ON WHETHER OR NOT THE ATTORNEY BENEFITED FROM THAT. WE HEARD THEIR ARGUMENTS FROM BOTH SIDES ON WHETHER SHE DID OR DID NOT. AND WE HEARD THE JUDGE SAY TODAY THAT IT WILL TAKE A COUPLE WEEKS AND, WHETHER OR NOT, HE HAS ALL THE INFORMATION TO MAKE THE DECISION ON WHETHER OR NOT. HE WILL STAY ON THIS. >>. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT. WILL WATCH ALSO DONE IN FLORIDA, WHERE ANOTHER ONE OF MR TRUMP'S LEGAL BATTLES ARE PLAYING OUT. THE ATTORNEY THERE, HEAD TO HEAD ON WITH THIS TRIAL DIFFERENT CASE. WHEN HIS TRIAL IN THIS OTHER CASE SHOULD START, RIGHT. NOW IT IS PENCILED IN FOR MAY 20th. THE PROSECUTORS ARE SAYING, OKAY, WE WOULD DO JULY 8th. MR TRUMP SAYS NO, MID-AUGUST SOUNDS GOOD, RIGHT IN BETWEEN THAT. THAT IS THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION. WE BRING IT UP BECAUSE POLITICS ARE AT PLAY HERE. THE FORMER PRESIDENTS TEAM SAYING THAT, REALLY, ANY SUMMER TRIAL THEY ARGUE IS TOO CLOSE TO THE ELECTION, ALSO TOO CLOSE TO HIS STATE TRIAL IN NEW YORK. AGAIN A SEPARATE CASE, THAN THE OTHER. ONES, IF YOU ARE LIKE, HAILLE, WAIT A SECOND. THIS CASE HAS TO DO WITH THE 40 FEDERAL CHARGES MR TRUMP FACES FOR ALLEGEDLY TAKING TOP-SECRET DOCUMENTS HE SHOULD HAVE HAD BACK TO MAR-A-LAGO, HIS HOME IN FLORIDA. I KNOW YOU REMEMBER THIS, THE DOCUMENTS LAID OUT IN THE BATHROOM OF MAR-A-LAGO, PUT ON STAGE, ET CETERA. KEN DILANIAN IS JOINING US NOW. WHICH WAYS THE JUDGE LEANING TOWARD, FIGURING OUT WHEN THIS TRIAL SHOULD START >>. YOU KNOW IT IS HARD TO KNOW HER, MIND HAILLE. I CAME OUT REASONABLY OPTIMISTIC, IF THAT IS THE WORD, OR CONFIDENT THAT THERE IS MORE OF A CHANCE, THAT I THOUGHT THIS CASE COULD GO TO TRIAL IN PART BECAUSE BOTH SIDES HAVE LAID OUT A CALENDAR OF COURSE IN THE CASE OF THE TRUMP LAWYERS. THEY DON'T REALLY MEAN IT. THEY MADE IT REALLY CLEAR TODAY THAT THEY HAVE NO DESIRE OR INTENTION OF HAVING THIS CASE TO TRIAL BEFORE THE ELECTION. THEY SAID THAT WOULD AMOUNT TO ELECTION INTERFERENCE. THEY SAID HE BELONGED ON THE CAMPAIGN TRIAL. IT IS INTERESTING. HE DID NOT PUSH BACK ON THAT WHATSOEVER, WHAT HE HAD TO SAY IN DC THAT ESSENTIALLY RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT DOESN'T EXEMPT YOU FROM YOUR DUTIES, OTHER THAN THAT BOTH SIDES ARGUED ABOUT PROCEDURAL ISSUES, SCHEDULING ISSUES. I THINK ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT THE TRUMP TEAM IS TRYING TO GET DISCOVERY FROM THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY IN THIS CASE- AND JACK SMITH'S TEAM IS RUNNING AGAINST THAT. HE REALLY CAME AWAY FROM TODAY WITH THE CONFIRMATION THAT THE TRUMP TEAM IS DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO SLOW THIS CASE DOWN. JACK SMITH IS TRYING TO GET THIS TO TRIAL AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. >>. KEN DILANIAN LIFE FOR US THERE GOOD TO SEE YOU OUT IN THE FIELD. >>> HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS SAYING TONIGHT THAT 120 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ARRESTED ACROSS RUSSIA RELATED TO THE FUNERAL FOR OPPOSITION LEADER, ALEXEI NAVALNY. YOU GOT TO SEE SOME OF THESE IMAGES HERE. LOOK AT THESE PICTURES HERE AND LISTEN FOR SECOND. THEY ARE CHANTING HIS NAME. THEY ARE SHOWING THEIR SUPPORT REMEMBER HE DIED SUDDENLY, WHERE A LOT OF -- BLAMING HIM FOR HIS DEATH, AND IT WAS APPARENTLY IN THE WORKS LIFE. FOR US IN LONDON, THE ARREST NOT SUPER SURPRISING. HERE THIS IS GIVEN. SOME OF THE DRAMATIC IMAGES WE ARE SEEING COMING OUT OF THIS MINERAL >>. YEAH, NOT SURPRISING, I GUESS IN SOME WAYS IT IS SURPRISING. THERE WAS A LIMITED NUMBER OF ARREST. SOME OF THESE PICTURES YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE ARE THOUSANDS ON THE STREET. YOU MENTIONED THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT THEY WERE CHANTING, THINGS THAT THEY WERE CHANTING. ALSO WE WILL NOT FORGIVE SO FAR AS THE CONCERN. YET THEY CAME OUT. THEY MADE THEIR VOICES HEARD BECAUSE OF COURSE HE CAN NO LONGER MAKE HIS VOICE HEARD. SHE PUT OUT A SOCIAL MEDIA MESSAGE IN WHICH SHE TOLD HAILLE ABOUT HOW SHE HOPES HE WILL BE PROUD OF HER LOOKING DOWN ON HER. IT WAS SO MOVING BUT ALSO GIVES YOU A SENSE THAT MOST FUNERALS HAILLE. THEY ARE A MOMENT OF CLOSURE, BUT NOT THIS ONE, NOT FOR HIS SUPPORTERS >>. Reporter, THERE IS A CONTRAST THIS WEEK, WHERE YOU HAVE PRESIDENT PUTIN MAKING A MAJOR SPEECH AND THEN TODAY, THIS ANSWER, IF YOU LIKE, FROM THOSE PEOPLE AND FROM -- WHO WAS HIS MOST FAMOUS OPPONENT >>. I THINK PEOPLE MIGHT HEAR IT IN WAIT A SECOND. THERE WERE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR A PRISONER SWAP. THAT WAS TO FREE HIM BEFORE HIS DEATH. HELP PEOPLE UNDERSTAND HOW IS THAT FAIR. HE WILL GET SOMETHING OUT OF NAVALNY'S RELEASE. WHY WOULD PUTIN HAD PENETRATE THAT >>. Reporter. IT IS CONFUSING, ISN'T IT? IT IS DIFFICULT TO READ AND WITH THE UNION TALKING ABOUT THE -- WE ARE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT IS GOING ON. I WILL SAY THIS: THERE IS -- IN JAIL IN GERMANY. THOSE AROUND HIM HAVE MADE IT PRETTY CLEAR. THAT IS A PERSON THEY WANT TO SEE RELEASED AND BACK TO RUSSIA FOR THAT THEY MAY AGREE TO A DEAL. MAYBE ALEXEI NAVALNY WAS PART OF THAT. MAYBE HE WASN'T. MAYBE IT WAS AN INITIAL CONVERSATION. THERE ARE CLEARLY -- HE HAS SUGGESTED THAT. MAYBE THEY ARE MOVING VERY QUICKLY AT THIS STAGE. AGAIN, WE DON'T KNOW. >>. KEIR SIMMONS, THANK YOU SO MUCH. WE MAY NEVER KNOW THE ANSWERS COMING OUT. DOZENS OF PEOPLE APPARENTLY DID AFTER A FIRE AT A SHOPPING MALL, HOW IT APPARENTLY STARTED AT A RESTAURANT ON THE FIRST FLOOR, PLUS ONE OF THE WORLD'S BIGGEST CITIES IS GETTING A. THAT WASN'T ME. YOU GOT TO SEE THIS. WE CONNECT AT 8:00 EASTERN AND 5:00 PACIFIC ON NBC NEWS NOW >>>. A DRAMATIC SCENE: THE DRIVER OF A BIG RIG DANGLING OFF A BRIDGE IN KENTUCKY LOOK AT THIS. THAT IS THE CAB. IT IS HANGING OFF. THIS IS THE MOMENT THAT THE DRIVER WAS RESCUED. THEY ARE BEING HOISTED BACK ONTO THE BRIDGE. IT IS OBVIOUSLY STILL ATTACHED. TELL US MORE ABOUT IT, HOW LONG IT TOOK AND HOW DID IT HAPPEN IN THE FIRST PLACE? >>. YES, I THINK THAT IS THE IMMEDIATE THING THAT COMES TO MIND WHEN YOU SEE THOSE IMAGES. IS THE DRIVER OKAY? REMARKABLY, SHE DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE ANY LIFE-THREATENING INJURIES. IT WAS A PRECAUTION BUT SHE WAS ALERT. ACCORDING TO AUTHORITIES, SHE WERE TALKING TO THE FIRST RESPONDERS. AS YOU MENTIONED, SOMEONE WAS ABLE TO RAPPEL DOWN THERE AND GET HER OUT A FLEE. THE TRUCK IS NOW BEING REMOVED FROM THE AREA. THERE BRIDGE UNDERSTANDABLY REMAINS CLOSED. THIS IS A MULTIVEHICLE COLLISION. THERE WERE TWO OTHER PEOPLE THAT DO HAVE INJURIES THAT APPEAR TO BE LIFE-THREATENING. THAT IS SOMETHING WE ARE KEEPING AN EYE ON. THIS IS AN INCIDENT INVOLVING FOUR VEHICLES. ACCORDING TO AUTHORITIES, THEN IT TAKES ABOUT 40 MINUTES TO GET THIS WOMAN WAS BEHIND THE WHEEL OF THE SEMITRUCK- OUT AND BACK TO SAFETY. WE HEARD FROM THE FIREFIGHTER THAT IS THE MAN WHO WENT IN THERE, RAPPEL DOWN AND HELP GET HER OUT. THIS IS PART OF WHAT HE SAID EARLIER: >> WE'VE DONE A FEW CRAZY THINGS, LIKE. I SAID WE TRAINED FOR THE SITUATION. IT FELT GOOD. NOW WE GO BACK AND WE DO IT AGAIN IF WE HAVE TO. >>. HE SAYS: WHEN HE GOT TO HER, SHE WAS PRAYING. HE SAID HE PRAYED WITH HER AS WELL. JUST A REMARKABLE SITUATION. HE IS NOW SAFELY ON LAND. WE ARE TOLD THOSE TWO OTHER PEOPLE WHO DO HAVE MORE SERIOUS INJURIES. >>. PLEASE, DO JESSE THANK YOU FOR THAT. LET'S GET YOU OVER TO THE FIVE THINGS OUR TEAM THINKS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT TONIGHT. NUMBER ONE: A JUDGE SENTENCING A PARAMEDIC TO FIVE YEARS IN PRISON. THIS MEDIC- ONE OF TWO, CONVICTED OF CRIMINAL HOMICIDE. IN NOVEMBER A YOUNG BLACK MAN DIED FROM CARDIAC ARREST. AFTER POLICE PUT HIM IN A CHOKE HOLD. A MEDIC INJECTED HIM WITH A LETHAL DOSE. A LOT OF FOLKS HAVE BEEN WATCHING THIS ONE >>>. NUMBER TWO: MICHELLE FOUND GUILTY IN THE DEATH OF HER BOYFRIEND, ESTRANGED WIFE. THE BOYFRIEND HAD ALMOST -- ALREADY BEEN CHARGED IN THIS CASE. HER BODY HAS NEVER BEEN FOUND. HER SISTER SAYING SHE IS IN THE SIT. ABOUT ALL THE CHARGES: IF YOU TEST POSITIVE FOR COVID, YOU DON'T HAVE TO ISOLATE FOR FIVE DAYS. YOU STAY AT HOME WHEN YOU ARE SICK. YOU GO BACK WHEN YOU'RE FEELING BETTER AND IF YOU DON'T RUN A FEVER, FOR 24 HOURS. THIS IS AS HOSPITALIZATION RATES AND DEATHS ARE LOWER. >>> NUMBER FOUR, CALIFORNIA. GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM IS DENYING THAT PANERA BREAD WILL BE EXEMPT FROM THE MINIMUM WAGE LAW FOR FAST FOOD WORKERS. HERE'S THE DEAL. IT BASICALLY DOESN'T --. WE DON'T KNOW WHY THAT IS A REPORT SUGGESTS IT COULD BE- BECAUSE A PANERA FRANCHISE OWNER HAS DONATED TO HIS CAMPAIGN. >>> NUMBER FIVE. OFFICIALS IN PARIS SAY THEY WILL TRY TO EASE UP TRAFFIC RESTRICTIONS DURING THE OLYMPICS. IT IS MEANT TO MAKE PEOPLE -- IS MUCH AS A ROUTINE. AS POSSIBLE A FEW DISRUPTIONS, IF POSSIBLE- HEAD OF THE SUMMER GAMES, ENDING THE WEEK WITH MORE RECORD HIGHS- I MEAN LISTEN, THEIR HIGHEST LEVELS EVER BEING DRIVEN BY THIS AI TECH BOOM, PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE NEW VIDEO. REMEMBER WHAT WE TOLD YOU ABOUT LAST WEEK. THEY ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A LEGAL BATTLE: ELON MUSK SUING ONE OF THE BIGGEST PLAYERS IN THE SPACE, OPEN AI AND ITS CEO. HE CLAIMS THAT OPEN AI HAS ABANDONED THEIR -- BROADLY WORKING TO BRING IN THESE BIG TOPICS- THE COFOUNDER OF OPEN AI BACK IN 2015.. BRYAN CHEUNG IS JOINING US NOW. HE STEPPED DOWN BACK IN 2018.. AI IS POTENTIALLY MORE DANGEROUS. CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG. ISN'T HE ALSO TRYING TO GET HIS OWN THING OFF THE GROUND? >>. YES, WE CAN'T FORGET ABOUT THAT, THE REASON HE IS DOING NOW. HE LEFT THE BOARD IN 2018.. PEOPLE WONDERING WHY? IT IS BECAUSE OF THE RELEASE OF CHAT DBT FOR -- WHICH HE FOUND IT WITH SAM ALTMAN IN 2015.. THE HALL -- WHOLE IDEA- WAS OPEN AND MAKING SURE. THIS IS A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION WORK. PEOPLE CAN SEE EXACTLY HOW THIS AI WAS BEING DEVELOPED FOR THE PURPOSES OF HUMANITY. THE RELIEF LAST YEAR WAS DONE SECRETLY- QUOTE: THE INTERNAL DESIGN WAS KEPT AND REMAINS A COMPLETE SECRET. AND ON INFORMATION FOR MICROSOFT. IT IS REALLY ALSO TAKING BLAME AT MICROSOFT. HOW MUCH THEY GET ROPED INTO THIS WILL BE A VERY INTERESTING TRIP. >>. THEY INVESTED $13 BILLION IN OPEN AI. THAT IS A NUMBER THAT HAS BEEN GOING AROUND HERE. CLEARLY, THEY ARE HITTING THE GAS ON AI, DRIVING THOSE BIG GAMES FOR THE -- CLEARLY, IT IS HERE TO STAY. -- CLEARLY, IT IS HERE TO STAY. >>. THE RACE IS ON. A LOT OF INVESTORS HAVE BEEN. A LOT OF INVESTORS HAVE BEEN SAYING THIS: THE EXCITEMENT, THE BIG STORY. HERE MICROSOFT IS TAKING THE LEAD. HERE'S THE QUESTION: OPEN AI DIDN'T FOLLOW THE RULES HE ALLEGES WITH THESE PRODUCTS. THAT MAYBE, THAT WOULD ALLOW HIS PRODUCT TO TAKE THE LEAD HERE. THIS IS NOT SOMETHING WHERE ELON MUSK NEEDS THE MONEY. THE QUESTION HERE IS WHETHER OR NOT. THIS CHANGES THE LEADERBOARD. TECHNOLOGY IS GETTING SMARTER >>. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >>>. WE COME BACK OUR OWN KRISTEN WALKER GOING ONE-ON-ONE WITH NIKKI HALEY FOR AN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW. A POSSIBLE SECOND TRUMPET TERM. >>>. A SCARY THING IN PERU: A TRUCK CARRYING BRICKS LOSS >>. AND HERE WHILE IT >> SOME REALLY GREAT DLS >>>. WEEKDAYS, FROM 12:00 TO 4:00 PM EASTERN ON NBC NEWS NOW >>>. NBC NEWS COVERS HUNDREDS OF INTERNATIONAL STORIES EVERY DAY IT CAN BE TOUGH TO READ OR LISTEN TO THE MALL. HERE IS A LOOK OF WHAT THEY ARE WATCHING: >> A HUGE FIRE AT A MALL KILLING AT LEAST 40 PEOPLE >> DOZENS OF OTHERS ARE HURT. >>. A GAS LEAK FROM A RESTAURANT IS PROBABLY WHAT SET OFF. >>> 21 MILLION PEOPLE ARE FACING A WATER SHORTAGE IN MEXICO CITY, THE BIGGEST CITY. THE POPULATION IN NORTH AMERICA RESERVOIRS HIT HISTORIC LOWS THIS WEEK. LOOK AT THAT, A LONG-STANDING DROUGHT AS PART OF THE PROBLEM THEY ARE HAVING TO RATION IN SOME SPOTS. >>> A TRUCK LOADED WITH BRICK LOSING CONTROL. LOOK AT THAT HURTING FIVE ELDERLY PEOPLE. YOU SAW THAT SECURITY CAMERA VIDEO CRASHING. THEN THE BRICKS THE HALLWAY SETTING UP BASICALLY. THE DRIVER APPARENTLY TOLD OFFICIALS THERE WERE MECHANICAL PROBLEMS CAUSING HIM TO LOSE CONTROL. BACK HERE AT HOME, JUST A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE BIGGEST PRIMARY ELECTION, HER LAST STANCE, THEY WILL HEAD TO THE POLLS ON SUPER TUESDAY. SHE HASN'T WON A SINGLE CONTEST SO FAR, BUT SHE HAS GOTTEN HER FIRST SENATE ENDORSEMENT. ALASKA IS ONE OF THE STATES THAT VOTE ON TUESDAY. ON TUESDAY, SITTING DOWN WITH HALEY TODAY ON MEET THE PRESS A PRETTY SERIOUS WARNING FROM WHAT SHE SEES AS A SECOND TERM >>. DO YOU THINK HE WOULD FOLLOW THE CONSTITUTION IF YOU WERE ELECTED TO A SECOND TERM? >>. I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN YOU ALWAYS WANT TO THINK SOMEONE WILL, BUT I DON'T KNOW WHEN YOU GO IN ANY TALK ABOUT REVENGE, YOU TALK ABOUT THE VINDICATION, TALKING ABOUT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN LIKE? I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. ONLY YOU CAN ANSWER FOR THAT. WHAT I CAN ANSWER FOR. I DON'T THINK THERE SHOULD EVER BE A PRESIDENT ABOVE THE LAW. I DON'T THINK THERE SHOULD EVER BE A PRESIDENT THAT HAS TOTAL IMMUNITY TO DO WHATEVER THEY WANT TO DO. I THINK WE NET -- NEED TO HAVE SOMEONE THAT OUR KIDS CAN LOOK UP TO, THAT THEY CAN BE PROUD OF. WE NEED TO HAVE A COUNTRY OF LAW AND ORDER, A COUNTRY OF FREEDOM AND A COUNTRY THAT GOES BACK TO RESPECTING THE VALUE OF THE TAXPAYER DOLLAR. >>. OUR VERY OWN KRISTEN WALKER, JOINING US NOW. SHE IS TRYING TO MAKE HER CLOSING ARGUMENTS, SHARPENING HER CASE AHEAD OF SUPER TUESDAY. MAYBE THE LAST TIME WE WILL SEE HER IN THIS RACE. TALK TO US ABOUT YOUR TAKEAWAYS FROM THIS DISCUSSION. >>. SHE SORT OF PAUSED AND THOUGHT ABOUT IT. WE CAN TELL SERIOUS SHE HAS BEEN SHARPENING WHAT SHE HAS BEEN SAYING AND THE FACT THAT SHE HASN'T WON ANY STATES. I PRESSED HER ON THIS REPEATEDLY. ARE YOU JUSTIN THIS TO MAKE THE CASE AGAINST TRUMP? TO MAKE THE CASE FOR YOUR VISION OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY? SHE DIDN'T DENY THAT THIS IS IN SOME WAYS FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY BUT SHE ALSO SAYS SHE IS NOT ANTI-TRUMP. OBVIOUSLY, THESE LEGAL BATTLES ARE LOOMING OVER ALL OF THIS. YOU AND I DISCUSSED THIS ENDLESSLY BUT IF HE DOES WIN THE NOMINATION, IT COULD BE A VERY DIFFERENT STORY. I ASKED HER: IF SHE WANTS TO SEE ALL OF THIS GO TO TRIAL BEFORE ELECTION DAY IN NOVEMBER. THIS IS HOW SHE ANSWERED SMITH. I THINK ALL THE CASES SHOULD BE DEALT WITH BEFORE NOVEMBER. WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN BEFORE THE PRESIDENCY HAPPENS, BECAUSE AFTER THAT, SHOULD HE BECOME PRESIDENT, I DON'T THINK ANY OF US WILL GET HEARD. I DON'T THINK THAT A PRESIDENT SHOULD BE IMMUNE FROM EVERYTHING, THINGS THAT NO OTHER PRESIDENT HAS ASKED FOR. I HOPE THE SUPREME COURT RULES QUICKLY AND I HOPE THEY MAKE THEIR DECISION. I DO THINK THEY HAVE TO GIVE AN ANSWER WITH THIS: >> THAT WAS NOTABLE ALSO, BY THE WAY, IS THAT -- THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL, IF YOU WILL CAMPAIGN TRAIL, IF YOU WILL >>. WHAT IS INTERESTING TO ME? GETTING IT FROM FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AND THE WHITE HOUSE? >> OKAY, A LITTLE TEASE. I ASKED FOR THAT A NUMBER OF TIMES. THAT IS REALLY THE QUESTION. IS SHE GOING BACK IN TALKING TO A NUMBER OF REPUBLICANS WHO HAVE SAID, YES, SHE HAS TO? >> THIS WILL BE ON THE NATIONAL STAGE. >> EXACTLY, I GO BACK TO YOUR POINT. HER ATTACKS HAVE GOTTEN SHARPER BY THE DAY. HOW DOES SHE WIN BACK? THE TRUMP VOTERS TALK ABOUT THAT. >> WILL TALK ABOUT THIRD-PARTY STUFF --. >> HOPEFULLY, I WILL SEE YOU 100% ON SUNDAY. APPRECIATE YOU. >> MORE FROM MS WALKER, MYSELF, TOM LLAMAS. BIG-TIME SUPER TUESDAY COVERAGE- SEVERAL HOURS OF IT AT LEAST. HOWEVER, YOU ARE WATCHING NOW AND ON ON BC -- NBC NEWS THE CHANGES IN ONE STATE. THAT COULD MEAN A NATIONWIDE MOVEMENT. SMITH, ALL RIGHT. >>>. TONIGHT'S ORIGINAL WITH IN DEPTH REPORTING ON A TOPIC WE'VE BEEN WATCHING TONIGHT: THE BATTLE OVER COLLEGE ADMISSIONS. LAWMAKERS ARE LOOKING TO END LEGACY ADMISSIONS. YOU KNOW, IF YOU GET IN BECAUSE A RELATIVE WENT THERE, THEY WANT TO END IT, NOT JUST FOR THE SCHOOLS BUT FOR PRIVATE SCHOOLS TOO. OF COURSE IN CONNECTICUT, THEY SAY IT IS NOT FAIR >>> A POTENTIAL FIRST: THE STATE TRYING TO END THE CONTROVERSIAL PROMISE IN HIGHER EDUCATION. LEGACY ADMISSION. THAT IS WHEN THE COLLEGE GIVES PREFERENCE TO A CHILD, GRANDCHILD, SIBLING ANY RELATIVE. COLORADO BANNED THE PRACTICE BACK IN 2021.. STATES LIKE CALIFORNIA, NEW YORK, MARYLAND, VIRGINIA AND MASSACHUSETTS- I THINK ABOUT THEIR OWN CONGRESS IS TOO. THIS COMES AFTER THE SUPREME COURT BLOCKED THE ADMISSIONS AGAINST HARVARD AND THE UNIVERSITY OF -- AT CHAPEL HILL, THEY WANT TO TAKE IT A STEP FORWARD, PUSHING TO DO THIS AT PRIVATE SCHOOLS TOO >>. THIS IS AN ISSUE OF FAIRNESS. I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT AFTER THE DECISION LAST YEAR >>. Reporter. WE ASKED DEREK, WHO RUNS CONNECTICUT STATE EDUCATION COMMITTEE, WHAT HE THINKS SCHOOLS LIKE YALE SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO THIS. HE SAYS IT IS BECAUSE OF TAXES >>. I SAW ONE REPORT: $90 MILLION MORE FOR THE PROPERTY TAXES IF THEY WERE GRANTED NONPROFIT STATUS. AS A RESULT, ALL OF US PAY MORE IN TAXES. RIGHT, THAT IS SO. THE SCHOOL CAN AVOID PAYING TAXES. THAT IS OKAY. THAT IS RE-ESTABLISHED. THAT THEY ARE A NONPROFIT. THAT MEANS THEY HAVE TO OPERATE WITH THE PUBLIC GOOD IN MIND. >>. WE ASKED THAT THEY WOULD END THE LEGACY ADMISSIONS. SO FAR ON THE ONE. CONNECTICUT- SO FAR ON THE ONE. CONNECTICUT SCHOOL WORKS FOR THE --. THIS REPRESENTS THE 15 PRIVATE UNIVERSITIES TELLING OUR TEAMS THE CONFLICT OF THE LEGISLATION PROHIBITING INDEPENDENT COLLEGES IN CONNECTICUT, BANNING THAT THIS WILL NOT MOVE THE NEEDLE. ON PROMOTING EQUITY, MANY SEEM TO DISAGREE, ESPECIALLY OUT WEST, WHERE SOME ENTIRE STATES DON'T HAVE SCHOOLS THAT CONSIDER THIS. JUST OVER A QUARTER OF THEM, NATIONWIDE, CONSIDER NATION STATUS DOWN FROM HALF IN 2020.. MORE ARE HOLDING TITLE TO THE PRACTICE: 57% OF THEM STILL CONSIDER LEGACY. THAT IS A HUGE ISSUE. >>. THEY HAVE AN ENORMOUS IMPACT ON OUR SOCIETY. IT IS REALLY A TICKET TO THE ELITE, MAKING SURE THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE WEALTHY TO GO TO ONE OF THESE SCHOOLS. >>. AND THAT IS WHAT THE DATA SHOWS. RIGHT, NOW, 30% OF THESE APPLICANTS COME FROM THE TOP 1%. TWO THIRDS FROM THE RICHEST 5%. EXPERTS SAY THAT THE BACKLASH NATIONWIDE IS NOW BIPARTISAN >>. THEY BOTH UNDERSTAND BASICALLY HOW UNFAIR THESE ARE. >>. THERE'S JUST ONE CATCH TO THIS BILL: IF THEY DECIDE NOT TO END THE LEGACY ADMISSION, THIS WON'T PENALIZE THEM. >>. MY EXPECTATION IS THAT COLLEGES IN CONNECTICUT ARE LAW- ABIDING INSTITUTIONS. ONCE THE LAW IS PASSED, THEY WILL >>. THIS SOUNDS LIKE THE VIBE YOU'RE GETTING FROM THE FOLKS YOU'RE TALKING WITH. THIS IS NOT A CONNECTICUT THING. THIS IS REALLY HEADING TOWARD A MOVEMENT MORE BROADLY ACROSS THE COUNTRY. >>. SOME ARE SAYING THAT FAIR IS FAIR AND HOW. THIS IS OKAY FOR THE ADMISSIONS ON THE LEGACY. IN MANY CASES THIS BENEFITS WEALTHY WHITE STUDENTS IN FACT. IN THIS WEEK, REINTRODUCING A BILL THAT WOULD FADE THE UNIVERSITY, THAT THEY WHO ARE GETTING MONEY. IF THEY CONTINUE THE LEGACY FUNDING, THEY MIGHT LOSE SOME LEGACY FUNDING. WHICH IS, I SHOULD SAY -- IT IS PUBLIC FUNDING. LOS ANGELES TIMES NEWSPAPER SAID IT COULD BE SOMETHING LIKE $26 MILLION. THEY COULD LOSE TODAY, AND THAT IS BIG NEWS FOR MOVIE THEATERS. >> GLAD TO HAVE YOU ON. APPRECIATE IT. MORE COVERAGE PICKS UP RIGHT. MORE COVERAGE PICKS UP RIGHT.",[52]
250,OiqXIM5UlPM,Hallie Jackson NOW - March 4 | NBC News NOW,NBC News,2024-03-05 02:25:23+00:00,"DON'T GO ANYWHERE. THE NEWS CONTINUES NOW WITH HALLIE. CONTINUES NOW WITH HALLIE JACKSON, STRAIGHT AHEAD >>> TONIGHT, WHAT YOU COULD CALL A 2024 WIN WITH DONALD TRUMP. MORE MAYBE AROUND THE CORNER. FIRST THAT DECISION COMING DOWN FROM THE SUPREME COURT TO KEEP THE FORMER PRESIDENT ON THE BALLOT IN ALL 50 STATES. WHY THE JUSTICES MADE THAT CALL AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR MR TRUMP'S WHITE HOUSE. PUSH. THEN WE ARE HOURS NOW FROM THE FIRST POLL OPENING IN 15 STATES FOR SUPER TUESDAY. OUR TEAM OUT ON THE TRAIL COVERING EVERY BIT OF IT AND WHAT COULD BE NIKKI HALEY'S LAST STAND- EVERYTHING YOU EVER WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT SUPER TUESDAY. JUST AHEAD, ACROSS THE COUNTRY, WE ARE ON THE GROUND AS PEOPLE TRY TO RECOVER FROM BANANAS, WEATHER CALIFORNIA, DIGGING OUT AFTER GETTING HIT WITH 10 FEET OF SNOW IN SOME PARTS IN TEXAS, FIREFIGHTERS ARE STRUGGLING TO CONTAIN THE WORST WILDFIRE IN THAT STATE'S HISTORY. WE ARE LIVE IN BOTH SPOTS >>> BEIJING, GETTING RID OF A DECADE'S OLD TRADITION. WHY THE GOVERNMENT IN CHINA IS DROPPING ONE OF THE ONLY OPPORTUNITIES FOR JOURNALISTS TO QUESTION TOP CHINESE LEADERS, TWO OF THE BIGGEST NAMES IN SPORTS AND MUSIC, TAKING A BIG SPRING. THE RECOMMENDING THAT LeBRON, JAMES AND DRAKE ARE BETTING BIG ON GOLF >>> HEY, I'M HALLIE. FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS IT IS A BIG DAY FOR LIBERTY WITH WHAT THE SUPREME COURT HANDED HIM A WIN FOR HIS 2024 CAMPAIGN LISTEN >>. IT IS ESSENTIALLY. YOU CAN NOT TAKE SOMEBODY OUT OF A RACE BECAUSE AN OPPONENT WOULD LIKE TO HAVE IT. THAT WAY, MOST STATES WERE THRILLED TO HAVE ME THERE. WERE SOME THAT DIDN'T AND THEY DID NOT WANT IT FOR POLITICAL REASONS >>. THE SUPREME COURT RULING UNANIMOUSLY THE FORMER PRESIDENT SHOULD STAY ON COLORADO'S PRIMARY BALLOT, A DECISION THAT COULD OF THROWN THE RACE INTO CHAOS IF THINGS WANT THE OTHER WAY RIGHT. REMEMBER THE QUESTION HERE IT WAS CENTERED ON. IF THE FORMER PRESIDENT INTENTIONALLY FORMALIZED A MOB, SIX COLORADANS THAT SUED SAID YES, THE SUPREME COURT DID NOT MAKE A DECISION ON THAT PART IF IT WAS TRUE. BUT THEY AGREED: INDIVIDUAL STATES SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO KICK FEDERAL MEMBERS OFF OF THE BALLOT. THAT BANS INSURRECTIONIST. YOU SEE THIS PART OF THE CONSTITUTION AT QUESTION HERE. THE JUSTICES TUESDAY WOULD BE A HOT MESS IF THEY WERE TAKEN OFF IN SOME STATES AND NOT OTHERS. THE REASON: THE RULING IS SIGNIFICANT, NOT JUST BECAUSE OF WHAT IT MEANS FOR COLORADO, WHERE HE WILL STAY ON THE BALLOT, BUT WHAT IT MEANS FOR HIM IN MAINE AND ILLINOIS, WHERE SIMILAR CASES COME UP. THE TIMING: THAT IS KEY. COLORADO IS A SUPER TUESDAY. THAT VOTES TOMORROW. SO IS MAINE, BY THE WAY. WE WILL TALK ABOUT WHAT TO EXPECT THEN WITH OUR CAMPAIGN CORRESPONDENTS, BUT I WANT TO START BACK AT HOME. IN WASHINGTON KEN, A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE LOOKING TO THE SUPREME COURT TO SEE WHICH WAY THE JUSTICES WOULD GO HERE. IF YOU WERE READING THE TEA LEAVES BEFORE TODAY- I KNOW YOU WERE- IT WAS CONSIDERED THE WAY THEY WERE GOING. THERE IS MORE TO COME HERE TOO FROM THE SUPREME COURT. TALK US THROUGH IT. >>. ABSOLUTELY, YOU USE THE TERM CHAOS IN YOUR OPENING. THE JUSTICES USED THAT TOO: STATES KNOCKING FEDERAL CANDIDATES OFF OF THE THE BALLOT AT DIFFERENT TIMES FOR DIFFERENT REASONS. THEY SAID IT WOULD BE A MESS. NOTHING IN THE CONSTITUTION REQUIRES US TO ENDURE THAT CHAOS, AND SO THEY UNANIMOUSLY DECIDED THAT, IN FACT, STATES DON'T HAVE THE POWER UNDER THE 14th AMENDMENT, TO DO THIS. THEY WENT FURTHER AND SAID ONLY AN ACT OF CONGRESS COULD ENFORCE THIS PROVISION IN THE 14th AMENDMENT. ONE THING THEY DID NOT DO HALLIE. THEY DID NOT TAKE A POSITION ON IF TRUMP ENGAGED IN INSURRECTION. OBVIOUSLY, THE COLORADO COURTS RULED THAT HE DID, AND WE HAVE REACTION FROM THE COLORADO SECRETARY OF STATE, WHO IS NOT HAPPY >>. MY LARGER REACTION IS DISAMOUNTMENT. I DO BELIEVE THAT STATES SHOULD BE ABLE, UNDER OUR CONSTITUTION, TO BAR US BREAKING INSURRECTIONISTS. IT LEAVES, OPEN LEAVES. OPEN THE DOOR FOR CONGRESS TO ACT, TO PASS AUTHORIZING LEGISLATION >>. AND THERE ARE SUCH BILLS THAT HAVE OPINION INTRODUCED HALLIE BUT NOBODY THINKS THEY HAVE A PRAYER OF PASSING >>. THIS IS A UNANIMOUS FROM THE SUPREME COURT. WE DON'T SEE A TON OF THOSE. IT WAS NOT NECESSARILY UNANIMOUS. THINKING ON THE PART OF ALL NINE JUSTICES EXPLAIN THAT PIECE OF IT >> ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. THE THREE LIBERALS, JOINED BY BARAT, DESCENDED ON THE QUESTION: IF IS IT ONLY AN ACT OF CONGRESS THAT MUST ENFORCE THIS PROVISION? THEY SAID THAT WENT TOO FAR AND OTHER WAYS THE JUDGE'S RULING. OR IF THEY WERE CONVICTED OF THE CRIME OF INSURRECTION, IF IT BARS THAT PERSON FROM HOLDING OFFICE AND THEY SUGGESTED. OR THE LIBERALS DID, THAT THE MAJORITY WAS DOING THIS IN PART TO HELP DONALD TRUMP AND PROCLUD PEOPLE. IT WAS A SHOT AT THE MAJORITY BUT THE MAJORITY RULES HERE. ONLY AN ACT OF CONGRESS CAN ENACT THIS. 14th AMENDMENT >>. KEN THANKS. >>>. NOW GARRET, WHO IS LIVE ON WHAT YOU CAN CALL IT, THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL IN WEST PALM BEACH, FLORIDA, NEAR THE FORMER PRESIDENT'S HOME. IT IS INTERESTING HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE LEGAL ISSUES OF THE FORMER PRECEDENCY. IT IS ONE OF THEM NOW A WIN. THE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES IN COLORADO. IN SOME OF THE OTHER STATES TOO, WE HAVE SEEN IN THESE PRIMARIES THOSE KINDS OF LEGAL ISSUES ACTUALLY MOVE REPUBLICANS TOWARDS FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP RIGHT >>. Reporter. THAT IS EXACTLY RIGHT, HALLIE. REALLY, THESE LEGAL CASES ACROSS THE SPECTRUM FROM THE CIVIL CASES TO THE CRIMINAL, TO THIS MORE ADMINISTRATIVE QUESTION TO THE SUPREME COURT HAD BEEN ROCKET FUEL FOR DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN AND UNDER CUT THE THEORY OF THE CASE. FOR SO MANY REPUBLICANS THAT RAN AGAINST HIM IN THIS PRIMARY THAT THOUGHT THE CASES WOULD SHOW THAT HE WAS WEAKER, LESS LIKELY TO DECEIT. PRESIDENT BIDEN TRUMP, IN HIS WAY, TWISTED IT INTO THE OTHER DIRECTION, SUGGESTING ALL OF THE CASES ARE PART OF A MASSIVE CONSPIRACY TO KNOCK HIM OFF OF THE BALLOT OR GET RID OF THE STRONGEST CHALLENGER TO JOE BIDEN. REPUBLICAN PRIMARY VOTERS AGREE. THEY HAVE BEEN WITH THEM EVERY STEP OF THE WAY, TALKING TO I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY VOTERS THAT TRUMP IS UNDER ATTACK AND IT IS UP TO THEM TO PROTECT HIM. HE IS TALKING ABOUT ORGANIZATIONED GOVERNMENT. HE HAS EFFECTIVELY WEAPONIZED THE CASES FOR HIM. IT WORKED WELL IN THE PRIMARY. AS WE SHIFT TO A GENERAL AUDIENCE, INDEPENDENT VOTERS PAYING LESS ATTENTION UP UNTIL NOW, THAT WILL CHANGE IN THE SUMMER AND THE FALL, BUT THAT IS ANOTHER BATTLE >>. HOLD THAT. I WANT TO COME BACK TO THAT, BUT I WANT TO HIT ON THIS INTERESTING MOMENT WHERE THE FORMER PRESIDENT WAS CLEARLY TRYING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A MESSAGING MOMENT. AFTER THE SUPREME COURT DECISION, CAME DOWN SAYING HEY, BRING IN THE CAMERAS. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT >>. YEP >>. Reporter. THAT IS RIGHT, WE ARE POINTING OUT. WE ARE NOT EXACTLY ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL A DAY BEFORE SUPER TUESDAY. THE REPUBLICAN FRONT-RUNNER IS NOT DOING CAMPAIGNING. WE ARE NOT OUT IN THE BATTLEGROUND STATES, WE ARE HERE IN FLORIDA. HE KNEW WITH THE SUPREME COURT ACTING TODAY. HE COULD SUMMON THE CAMERAS IN GET A LOT OF ATTENTION, WHERE HE MADE MUCH OF THE SAME CASE HE DOES ON THE TRAIL. HE ONLY TALKED ABOUT THE COLORADO CASE FOR A BRIEF MOMENT AT THE TOP OF HIS REMARKS AND THEN WORKED THE REST A LITTLE BIT TALKING ABOUT THE MORE IMPORTANT HIS VIEW, THE CASES THAT THE SUPREME COURT HAS COMING UP IF HE WILL HAVE IMMUNITY FROM OTHER PROSECUTION. LISTEN TO WHAT HE HAD TO SAY ABOUT THAT. >>. IF A PRESIDENT DOES NOT HAVE FULL IMMUNITY, YOU REALLY DON'T HAVE A PRESIDENT. I PRESIDENT HAS TO BE FREE. A PRESIDENT HAS TO BE IF THE PRESIDENT DOES A GOOD JOB, I DID. >>. HALLIE, OBVIOUSLY THE LEGAL QUESTIONS ARE NOT WHEN OR NOT HE DID A GOOD JOB, BUT THE IMMUNITY QUESTION IS SO ESSENTIAL TO WHAT THE COUNTRY WILL LOOK LIKE HE IS TRYING TO MAKE IT ABOUT SOMETHING BIGGER THAN HIMSELF. BUT THAT SUPREME COURT DECISION ON IF HE IS IMMUNE FROM PROSECUTION COULD HAVE A HUGE- I MEAN A HUGE- IMPACT ON WHO THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES >>. GARRET, LIVE FOR US IN WEST PALM, NEAR THE FORMER PRESIDENT'S HOME. THANK YOU. >>>. LET ME BRING IN ALI, WHO IS IN ONE OF THE SUPER TUESDAY STATES, THE STATE OF TEXAS. GARRET KNOWS ABOUT THAT STATE AS WELL, BUT HE IS TALKING ABOUT THE IDEA THAT THE PRESIDENT IS SHIFTING TOWARDS THE GENERAL A ELECTION, THE CANDIDATE YOU ARE COVERING, NIKKI HALEY, TIME-OUT. WE ARE NOT THERE, YET WE ARE IN PRIMARY LAND WITH TOMORROW NIGHT. IT IS REALLY HARD TO NOT SAY THE CLICHI. IT IS MAKE OR BREAK. IT IS TRUE. >>. Reporter. IT HAS THE BENEFIT OF BEING TRUE. NIKKI HALEY IS THE PERSON STANDING IN THE WAY. I, WITH UNIT, LET'S MOVE INTO A GENERAL ELECTION POSTURE. ONE THING TO SAY. IT IS AN UPHILL BATTLE FOR THE POLLING. THAT IS TRUE. IT IS IS ANOTHER THING TO SAY IT BECAUSE OF THE GRAPHIC I AM GOING TO PUT UP ON THE SCREEN. I WILL PUT IT UP HERE. IF YOU LOOK AT THE WAY THE RULES ARE WORKING IN THESE STATES, IT IS NOT JUST A QUESTION OF OH, THE POLLING IS IN TRUMP'S FAVOR. IT IS THE THRESHOLD YOU NEED TO HIT TO GET DELEGATES. ACTUALLY, HOW YOU BECOME THE NOMINEE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. YOU LOOK AT A STATE, FOR EXAMPLE, LIKE TEXAS, WHERE I AM. THIS IS ONE WHERE YOU GOT TO GET MORE THAN 50%. YOU TAKE ALL OF THE DELEGATES. YOU LOOK AT ANOTHER STATE, LIKE I THINK IT IS MINNESOTA, UP AT THE TOP. ANOTHER STATE- SHE WENT TO THERE. YOU HAVE TO HIT THE HIGHER THRESHOLD OF 80% TO GET ALL OF THE DELEGATES. IT IS UNLIKELY. WE WILL SEE IF SOMEONE IS LIKELY TO HIT 80%, THAT SOMEONE, LIKELY TRUMP. THAT IS WHY THE MATCH IS HARD FOR NIKKI HALEY. THERE ARE STATES ON THE MAP, LIKE VIRGINIA OR MAINE, FOR EXAMPLE, WHERE HALEY HAS SPENT TIME AND WHERE THEY FEEL, LIKE THE RULES ON THE GROUND OF WHO IS ABLE TO VOTE IN THE PRIMARIES MEAN. IT IS PROBABLY MORE VERTAL GROUND FOR HER TO GET HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF THE VOTE. WE ARE NOT JUST PLAYING THE GAME OF GET A GOOD PERCENTAGE HIT A CERTAIN THRESHOLD TO TAKE HOME DELEGATES THERE >>. WHAT IS INTERESTING IS THE WAY THAT NIKKI HALEY IS IN FACT. THIS CAMPAIGN, THE PRIMARY CAMPAIGN, IS CLOSING IN ON ITS END. TRUMP NOT THE MAGIC NUMBER OF DELEGATES HE NEEDS. HE COULD GET IT BY THE MIDDLE OF MARCH. IF THAT IS THE CASE, THE QUESTION BECOMES NOT JUST WHAT DOES NIKKI HALEY DO, BUT WHO DOES SHE POTENTIALLY BACK IN THIS GENERAL ELECTION RIGHT? SHE TOLD OUR FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE OVER ON MEET THE PRESS. SHE IS NOT BOUND BY THE PROMISE TO RNC TO SUPPORT THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE >>. TRICKY LITTLE THING, WHEN THE CANDIDATES REMEMBER IT IS JUST A PIECE OF PAPER. THERE IS NO LEGAL BINDING TO SIGNING A PLEDGE WITH THE RNC THAT SAYS: YEAH, I WILL SUPPORT THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE. ALL OF THEM SIGNED THAT TO GET ON THE DEBATE STAGE. NIKKI HALEY TELLING WELKER. I KNOW I SIGNED IT TO GET ON THE DEBATE STAGE, BUT IT IS A DIFFERENT RNC. SHE IS LEAVING THE DOOR OPEN TO NOT ENDORSING HIM OR ENDORSING HIM. ALL OF THAT PUTS THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE WHEN IT COMES TO. HALEY HAS TO GET OUT OF THE RACE FIRST BEFORE SHE IS ABLE TO ENDORSE ANYONE. AND WE ARE NOT THERE, YET, BECAUSE THE CAMPAIGN IS NOT THERE. YET. THE CANDIDATE IS SAYING IN VAGUE TERMS: THEY ARE GOING TO STAY IN THIS RACE UNTIL THEY STOP BEING COMPETITIVE. NOW DEPENDS ON WHO DEEMS HER COMPETITIVE. AS LONG AS SHE SEES THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WANT AN ALTERNATIVE. IT IS CLEAR. SHE WILL KEEP RUNNING OUT THE CLOCK. MAYBE IT ENDS ON WEDNESDAY, MAYBE THE WEEK AFTER. AS LONG AS TRUMP HAS NOT LOCKED IT UP, SHE COULD KEEP GOING >>. AND IF SHE DOES, YOU WILL BE RIGHT THERE, COVERING EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. >> ORK H YES >>. WE WILL SEE YOU TOMORROW NIGHT ALONG WITH THE REST OF THE TEAM HERE, WITH THE SPECIAL SUPER TUESDAY COVERAGE. IT STARTS ACTUALLY EXACTLY 24 HOURS FROM NOW MINUS 12 MINUTES. HOWEVER, YOU ARE WATCHING 5 FULL HOURS OF SUPER TUESDAY WITH MYSELF, TOM LLAMAS, ALL OF THE FOLKS YOU SEE ON THE SCREEN ROLLING INTO NBC NEWS AT 10:00 EASTERN. DO NOT MISS IT. BIG DAY IN POLITICS AND BEYOND >>>. OUT WEST, RIGHT NOW, MILLIONS OF PEOPLE DIGGING THEMSELVES OUT. AFTER A BLOCKBUSTER SNOWSTORM SLAMS PART OF THE WEST. WHEN WE SAY BLOCKBUSTER, WE MEAN IT. 10 FEET OF SNOW IN SOME SPOTS. IF YOU CAN BELIEVE IT, THE WIND IN SOME OF THESE PLACES STRONGER THAN A CAT 5.. THE STORM BURIED HOMES. NOW ANOTHER MONSTER STORM ON THE WAY, STEVE PATTERSON, IN THE THICK OF IT IN CALIFORNIA, SNOW BLOWERS CEASED TO FUNCTION. THEY CAN ONLY DO SO MUCH. YOU ARE STARTING TO SEE SOME OF THE CRITICAL HIGHWAYS. OPEN BACK UP. TELL US WHAT YOU ARE SEEING AND WHERE IT GOES. >>. WE ARE SEEING SNOW AGAIN. HALLIE, I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO TALKING TO YOU WITH SUNLIGHT AND IT HAPPENED, MAYBE WITH SIX HOURS TODAY. MY PRODUCER, MY CREW- THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE SEWN IN 72 HOURS WHERE IT WAS NOT SNOWING AND WE GOT FLURRIES AGAIN, BECAUSE A NEW SYSTEM IS MOVING IN THANKFULLY. YOU MAY BE ABLE TO SEE THE GROUND BEHIND ME. THAT WAS NOT POSSIBLE LESS THAN 24 HOURS AGO. THERE HAS BEEN A LULL IN THIS. THERE ARE ESSENTIALLY TWO SYSTEMS: THE STORM, WHICH IS MOVING OUT, AND THEN THIS SYSTEM THAT IS MOVING IN. I SAY SYSTEM BECAUSE IT IS NOWHERE NEAR WHAT WE SAW OVER THIS WEEKEND. THIS WAS CONTINUOUS STORMS, CONTINUOUS SNOW SINCE THURSDAY NIGHT. ESSENTIALLY IT SHUTDOWN I-80.. IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS AREA, IT IS MAJOR THOROUGHFARE. IT IS THE LIFEBLOOD OF THE MOUNTAIN REGION OF CALIFORNIA. THAT SHUTTING DOWN MEANT E CERTAINLY PEOPLE THAT WOULD HAVE TO GO 3 MILES TO GO SOMEWHERE HAD TO GO 10 MILES AROUND THE ENTIRETY OF LAKE TAHOE. WHILE IT IS HAPPENING, IT IS CONTINUING TO SNOW SHEETS 8-10 FEET. IN SOME PLACES, 10-12 FEET. IF YOU GO HIGH ENOUGH WHEN YOU ARE UP, THAT HIGH, THAT IS WHEN YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE 100, 90 MILE-AN-HOUR WIND GUST. THIS STORM WAS RIDICULOUS, MORE RIDICULOUS THAN THAT. IT WAS SO RELENTLESS, NOT JUST THE WIND SPEED, IT JUST THAT IT WOULD NOT STOP. AND SO, FINALLY, IT HAS RESIDENTS GIVING THEMSELVES A BREATHER BUT AGAIN, NOT BEFORE MORE FLURRIES MOVE IN AS THEY ARE RIGHT NOW. THAT COULD BE A GUT PUNCH FOR THAT COULD BE A GUT PUNCH FOR FOLKS DIGGING OUT AND SNOW THE LIFEBLOOD OF THIS PLACE- 10 FEET. NO, THAT CAUGHT A LOT OF PEOPLE OFF GUARD. YEAH YOU GUYS IN THE MEDIA. YEAH YOU GUYS IN THE MEDIA, HYPE IT UP ALL OF THE TIME. NOW, LISTEN TO THIS: >>. WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH IT THROUGHOUT THE STORM. IT TAKES A COUPLE HOURS BEFORE. YOU HAVE EVERYTHING THAT YOU. YOU HAVE EVERYTHING THAT YOU HAVE DONE COVERED UP AGAIN. >>Caller: IT IS SNOW, WE GOT >>. IT IS SNOW, WE GOT IT >>. >>. >> NOT LEAST OF WHICH LIVE IN TRUCKEE, MILLIONS OF FIREFIGHTERS STRUGGLING TO GET AWAY. IT IS SO BAD THAT THE GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA IS SENDING THEIR NATIONAL GUARD TO HELP FIGHT THIS THING. LOOK AT THIS. MORE THAN A MILLION ACRES BURNED. TONS OF SMOKE, PEOPLE TRYING TO DO WHAT THEY CAN, THESE RESCUE CREWS. IT CAN BE HARD, I THINK, FOR PEOPLE TO WRAP THEIR HEADS AROUND THE SCOPE. THE SIZE OF THIS THING- MORGAN TALK US THROUGH IT. >>. INCREDIBLY WELL SAID HALLIE. >>. YOU CAN GET ON A HIGHWAY AND DRIVE FOR 2 HOURS TO CANADIAN TEXAS AND THE MAJORITY OF THE DRIVE. YOU WILL SEE CHARRED LANDSCAPES. THAT IS WHAT A BURN AREA LOOKS LIKE WHEN IT CONSUMES MORE THAN A MILLION ACRES, WHICH IS WHAT THE SMOKEHOUSE CREEK FIRE HAS DONE ONE OF JUST FIVE NAMED FIRES HERE IN THE TEXAS PANHANDLE. LET'S LOOK AT IT BY THE NUMBERS: MORE THAN A MILLION ACRES BURNED. WE HAVE 500 BUILDINGS THAT HAVE BEEN LOST BY THE RESULT OF THE FLAMES AND THE MOST TRAGIC NUMBER OF ALL TWO LIVES LOST FROM THIS FIRE THAT STARTED A WEEK AGO. TODAY, AND PRETTY MUCH EVERY SINGEL DAY SINCE THEN, A NEW PORTION OF THE TEXAS PANHANDLE HAS BURNED. IT CERTAINLY IS LEAVING. EVERYONE FEELING THAT THEY ARE NOT EVEN OUT OF THE WOODS, EVEN THOUGH THE WINDS HAVE DIED DOWN. THERE IS SO MUCH FUEL AROUND HERE THAT CAN BURN. IT HAS THE OFFICIALS SAYING THIS: TAKE A LISTEN. >>. IT IS INEVITABLE THAT WE WILL GET ANOTHER START. >> YOU BELIEVE THAT. >> IF IT IS A POWER LINE, SOMEBODY DRAGGING CHAINS, A TRUCK, BACKFIRING SOMETHING OVER INTO THE GROVES, ANYTHING >> JUST ONE SPARK, JUST ONE SPARK. >>. AND SPEAKING OF POWER LINES, ONE WOMAN, THAT LIVES IN CANADIAN TEXAS AND LOST HER HOME, IS PURSUING A LAWSUIT AGAINST A UTILITY PROVIDER. IN THIS LAWSUIT, HALLIE. SHE IS SAYING: BECAUSE THEY FAILED TO MAINTAIN A POWER POLE, IT FELL DOWN, SNAPPING AT THE BASE, PUTTING THE POWER LINES CLOSE TO THE DRIVEWAY GRASS. AND THE LAWSUIT ALLEGE: THAT IS WHAT CAUSED THE FIRE. A FIRE CHIEF SAYS HIS TEAM DID OBSERVE ONE POWER POLE DOWNRIGHT AROUND THE TIME THIS FIRE BEGAN. IN THE MEANTIME THERE WAS AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT FIRE THAT PLAYED OUT LAST NIGHT, NOT TOO FAR FROM WHERE WE ARE IN NEIGHBORING STANFORD. THAT SMALL COMMUNITY HAD TO BE EVACUATED, HALLIE, THIS TOWN HAD TO BE EVACUATED FOR THE THIRD TIME FROM A WILDFIRE IN LESS THAN A WEEK. THE STRESS OF THAT, WHEFN THEY GO BACK HOME AND THEIR HOME IS FINE. THE SHEER OCCURRENCE IS WEIGHING HEAVILY ON EVERYONE HERE. >>. IT IS DISRUPTIVE TO SAY THE LEAST MORGAN RIGHT IN THE THICK OF IT THERE IN TEXAS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT. >>> BILL KARINS, NOW. OKAY, BILL, ALL OF THIS AND NOW TORNADOES >>. YOU KNOW IT IS SPRING WHEN I WAS NOT EXPECTING TORNADOES BUT IT HAS THAT SPRING FEELING, IT HAS BEEN THAT WARM. WE HAD REPORTS OF AT LEAST 3-4 TORNADOES THANKFULLY OUT IN FIELDS. NO REPORTS OF INJURIES OR DAMAGE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. WE HAVE THIS LINE GOING FROM THE QUAD-CITIES TO OUTSIDE OF MILWAUKEE: A NEW TORNADO WARNING SOUTHERN WISCONSIN. THIS WILL BE ABOUT 40 MILES AN HOUR OF ME MOVING ALONG INTERSTATE 43. WE WILL KEEP YOU POSTED ON THAT. OUR FRNDS IN THE QUAD-CITY. A STORM RIGHT OVER DAVENPORT. THAT IS ONE OF THE STARS WE ARE WATCHING THE FIRE SITUATION. NORTH TEXAS. THE WINDS LIGHT TODAY. THEY WILL BE LIGHTISH TOMORROW- 10-20 MILE-AN-HOUR GUSTS THE REAL STORY. WE JUST NEED RAIN TO PUT THE FIRE OUT AND BE DONE WITH IT. THIS IS HOW MUCH RAIN FALLING IN THE NEXT DAY, THE NEXT WEEK: A DROP IN THE BUCKET. THE STORM IS NOT GOING AWAY ANY TIME SOON. WE DID SEE THE SNOW BEGINNING IN THE PORTIONS OF THE SIERRA AND IT LOOKS LIKE WE WILL SEE THAT ON AND OFF THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT. THESE SNOW TOTALS- 5 OR 10 FEET. PEOPLE WERE LIKE YEAH SURE. ALL RIGHT SUGAR BOWL. 126 INCHES OF SNOW IN FOUR DAYS. THAT IS 10.5 FEET. THE NEXT STORM, NOTHING COMPARED TO THAT HALLIE, THIS WILL BE JUST ABOUT AN INCH AND A HALF NOW IN NORFORD TAHOE, OUT OF THE WEATHER. >> ARE WE OUT OF THE RISK OF AVALANCHE? >> NO, THAT WILL CONTINUE ONCE THE ROADS ARE CLEARING, THE SKIERS ARE DROOLING, THERE WILL BE A LOT OF AVALANCHE MITIGATION GOING ON AND THE DYNAMITE IN THE HILLS AND KNOCKING THE SNOW DOWN. SOME MOUNTAINS ARE ONLY LETTING PEOPLE GO UP WITH AVALANCHE GEAR ON BEACONS AND EVERYTHING ELSE. >> THAT IS SMART, CAN NOT BE TOO SAFE. >>. THANK YOU. GOOD TO SEE YOU. >>> TAKING YOU BACK TO WASHINGTON NOW. THE VICE PRESIDENT THERE MEETING WITH THE TOP ISRAELI LEADER, AS SHE IS GIVING A BLUNT MESSAGE TO ISRAEL: WATCH. >>. CIVILIANS, INNOCENT CIVILIANS, HAVE BEEN KILLED. WE NEED TO GET MORE AID IN. THAT REMAINS OUR POSITION. >>. ANOTHER LAYER TO THE DRAMA: HERE ONE OF THE WAR CABINET MEMBERS OF ISRAEL IS IN WASHINGTON DEFYING PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, WHO DID NOT WANT HIM TO GO. THE VICE PRESIDENT SHARP LINE HERE COMES. 24 HOURS AFTER, SHE CALLED FOR AN IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE AND CRITICIZED ISRAEL FOR NOT DOING ENOUGH TO STOP THE HUMANITARIAN CATASTROPHE IN GAZA. FOR HIS PART, HE IS TRYING TO GET MORE HELP TO THOSE THAT NEED IT. YOU ARE SEEING HERE THE AIRDROPS STARTED. WITHIN THE LAST 72 HOURS, 38,000 MEALS DROPPED INTO GAZA. I WANT TO BRING YOU IN NOW. IT IS A SHIFT FOR THE VICE PRESIDENT. THEN CERTAINLY THE STAGE SHE IS BEING VOCAL ABOUT THIS TALK US THROUGH. WHAT IS HAPPENING BEHIND THE SCENES? HERE IS SHE FLOATING SOME OF THE TRIAL BALLOONS FOR THE REST OF THE ADMINISTRATION HERE >>. IT WOULD SEEM NOT THE VICE PRESIDENT. YOU JUST PLAYED A CLIP OF HER THIS AFTERNOON STOPPING IN A HALLWAY TO TALK TO THE MEDIA, AS SHE WAS LEAVING AN EVENT WHERE SHE SPOKE- NOT A PLANNED EVENT, NOT ONE THAT WE KNEW ABOUT IT PRIOR TO HER APPEARING THERE. HE MADE THE POINT. THE COMMENTS SHE MADE TODAY AND YESTERDAY IN ALABAMA WERE IN LOCKSTEP WITH WHAT PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS SAID AND WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN PUTTING FORWARD SINCE THE EARLY DAYS OF THIS CONFLICT IN GAZA. WE GOT THE READ OUT FROM THE VOICE PRESIDENT'S MEETING THE WAR CABINET WHERE WE ARE TOLD. SHE REITERATED OF COURSE US SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL IN THE FIGHT AGAINST HAMAS BUT ALSO VOCAL IN THAT MEETING ABOUT HER CONCERNS AROUND HUMANITARIAN SITUATION, THE CONDITIONS IN GAZA RIGHT NOW AND THE INTENSE AND GROWING NEED FOR HUMANITARIAN AID TO GET INTO GAZA TO HELP PEOPLE WHO ARE SUFFERING THERE. SHE CALLED ON HAMAS. WE UNDERSTAND IN THAT MEETING TO ACCEPT THE TERMS OF THE DEAL THAT ARE ON THE TABLE RIGHT NOW, THE DEAL MEANING A CEASEFIRE OF SIX WEEKS, AND WOULD MEAN THABILITY TO GET MORE AID IN GAZA. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WAS SAYING IN THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS, IN PARTICULAR HEARING IT FROM SO MANY PLACES, INCLUDING TODAY FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT LISTEN >>. I WILL LET THEM SPEAK TO THEIR OWN DECISION-MAKING. THE POINT THAT WE MAKE TO THEM IS THAT THE SITUATION AS IT STANDS NOW, IT IS UNACCEPTABLE AND EVERYONE INVOLVES NEEDS TO DO MORE >>. THE VICE PRESIDENT URGING THEM TO DO MORE. ISRAEL TO DO MORE. GET MORE AID IN FASTER. WHEN THEY MEET WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE TOMORROW HERE IN DC, YOU WILL HEAR THAT MESSAGE AGAIN >>. ON THE HILL AGAIN, MAKING SOME OF THE STOPS LIVE FOR US OUTSIDE OF THE WHITE HOUSE: THANK YOU. >>>. THE MAN RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT IS BEING CALLED ONE OF THE WORST NATIONAL BREECHES IN YEARS: 6 COUNTS OF ESPIONAGE ACT. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT JACK TEIXEIRA, WHO ADMITTED TO LEAKING ON DISCOURSE. THE PUNISHMENT FITS THE CRIME: LISTEN >>. VIOLATED HIS DUTY TO PRESERVE, PROTECT AND DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES. HE USED HIS POSITION OF TRUST GIVEN TO HIM BY THE GOVERNMENT, DID NOT CARE AT ALL ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES >>. TEIXEIRA IS UP TO 17 YEARS IN PRISON. AFTER THIS- THIS SHOWING HIM GETTING ARRESTED- HE WAS ABLE TO LEAK DOCUMENTS, INCLUDING ONES, RELATED TO AMERICA'S SPYING EFFORTS, RUSSIA'S WAR ON UKRAINE FOR MONTHS. TOM WINTER IS FOLLOWING THIS ONE. FOR US, IT FELT LIKE A RECKONING MOMENT HERE, RIGHT, A MOMENT FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO SAY LIKE, THIS WILL NOT BE TOLERATED. >>. YES, ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. REMEMBER INSPECTOR GENERAL'S REPORT BY THE AIR FORCE LOOKED AT THIS AND ACTUALLY PUT DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS AGAINST 15 OF THEIR MEMBERS, SAYING: YOU KNEW HE WAS DOING THESE DEEP DIVES. HE WAS GOING DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE. HUNDREDS OF SEARCHES, PROSECUTORS SAID FOR CLASSIFIED INFORMATION >> STUFF. HE SHOULD NOT HAVE HAD ACCESS TO STUFF. HE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT. HE WAS NOT IN POSITION OF NEED TO KNOW. THAT IS WHAT THEY TARGETED. IT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF THE SPY MOVIE. IT IS. IT IS NOT ALL TO THE TASK THAT HE WAS ASSIGNED TO. HE IS DOING IT AND HE PUTS IT OUT THERE. YOU LOOK AT THAT BIG FBI PRESENCE WHEN THEY WERE SEARCHING THE HOME AND WENT TO MAKE THE ARREST >>. YOU REMEMBER WHEN THAT HAPPENED, IT WAS WALL-TO-WALL >>. WALL-TO-WALL AND HE HAD HIS GUN SAFE TWO FEET FROM HIS BED. IF YOU LOOK AT HIS BEDROOM. IT IS SET UP AND LOOKS LIKE AN IS SET UP AND LOOKS LIKE AN ARMY NEST WITH CAMOUFLAGE. HE HAS GOT SKIM ATTICS ITEMS. HERE IS WHY HE WAS ALLOWED INTO THE MILITARY IN THE FIRST PLACE. NOW HE IS PART OF A LONG LIST OF PEOPLE OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS WHO HAVE BEEN INDIVIDUALS, WHO HAVE BEEN PART OF THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, WHO HAVE OPINION PART OF THE IA, WHO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH SHARING SOME OF OUR CROWN JEWELS OF OUR INTELLIGENCE. WHEN YOU PUT IT TOGETHER, HE LOOKS AT THE EVIDENCE AND SAYS: 60 YEARS VERSUS 16 AND CHANGE. ANYBODY CAN DO THAT MATH. HE DEFIES TO GO FOR THE GUILTY PLEA. I THINK IT RAISES TROUBLING QUESTIONS AS FAR AS OF THE AMOUNT OF MATERIAL THAT ANYONE HAS ACCESS TO IN THE SYSTEM THAT HE USED TO GET THIS INFORMATION. SO IT CERTAINLY SAY DAY OF RECKONING, AS YOU PUT IT. INTERESTING TO SEE IF WE WILL SEE OTHER CASES LIKE THIS, AS A NEW GENERATION PEOPLE THAT ARE USED TO GOING INTO DEEP DIVES IN THEIR EARLY 20s GETS CONTINUING ACCESS TO THOSE SYSTEMS >>. >> THANK YOU. >>. A MASS PRISON ESCAPE IN HAITI, HOW THEY ARE TRYING TO GET THINGS UNDER CONTROL, PLUS BY ONE OF THE US'S BIGGEST UNIVERSITIES, IS SUSPENDING GREEK LIFE PERIOD >>. PEOPLE RUNNING FOR THEI LIVES >>>. THE US EMBASSY IN HAITI TELLING ALL AMERICANS TO GET OUT ASAP. AMERICAN AIRLINES IS CANCELING FLIGHTS. HAITI GOVERNMENT DECLARING A STATE OF EMERGENCY, A CURFEW THAT GOES INTO PLACE. TONIGHT, ARMED GANGS STORMED THE COUNTRY'S BIGGEST PRISONS IN A HUGE PRISON BREAK. LOOK AT THIS. LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED AFTER. THOUSANDS OF INMATES FLEEING THE PRISONS, THEY WERE ESCAPING. NINE PEOPLE KILLED, FOUR OF THEM, POLICE OFFICERS, THE DEADLY SCENE, THE LATEST TENSIONS IN THE COUNTRY, PART OF A BIGGER PUSH BY THE POWERFUL GANGS TO GET THE PRIME MINISTER TO RESIGN. NOW TELL US MORE ABOUT THE PRISON BREAK. IT IS DRAMATIC. WE ARE SEEING IMAGES OF THE AFTERMATH THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO SEE. WHAT IS THE PLAN TO GET THINGS UNDER CONTROL >>. Reporter. THERE IS A PLAN TO GET THINGS UNDER CONTROL. IN THE PAST YEAR, AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT THE GANGS CONTROL 80% OF THE AREA. IT WILL BE DEFENDANT FOR THEM TO GET CONTROL OF IT. THE GANGS ARE ORGANIZED AND THE RESULT OF THIS PRISON BREAK SHOWS HOW POWERFUL THEY ARE. THEY NOT ONLY ATTACKED THE PRISON BUT THEY ATTACKED THE POLICE STATIONS, ATTACKED THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL STATION AND THE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT. TODAY, AMERICANS- SOME AMERICAN AIRLINES- HAVE SUSPENDED FLIGHTS TEMPORARILY TO HAITI, AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE SITUATION IN HAITI DETERIORATING FOR MONTHS. NOW THERE IS ABOUT 11 MILLION PEOPLE IN HAITI, ONLY 9,000, SOME ESTIMATED 9,000- NATIONAL POLICE OFFICERS, SO IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO REGAIN THERE CONTROL. WE HAVE SEEN THE VIOLENCE ON THE STREETS. HAITI- MANY SECURITY EXPERTS SAID- IS A FAILED STATE, WITH THE PRIME MINISTER TRAVELING TO KENYA TO TRY TO GET HELP FROM A FORCE THAT WOULD BE COMING. NOW THIS HAPPENS: THE GANGS WANT THE PRIME MINISTER TO STEP DOWN. HE HAS BEEN THE PRIME MINISTER. AFTER, THE FORMER LEADER WAS ASSASSINATED. IT HAS BEEN CHAOTIC. IT IS DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE. WITH THE CURRENT POLICE FORCE IN HAITI, THEY WILL BE ABLE TO REGAIN CONTROL. >>. CAN YOU GIVE ME A SENSE OF THE FALL OUT INTERNATIONALLY WHAT HAPPENS IN HAITI? THE WORLD IS WATCHING >>. Reporter. THE WORLD HAS BEEN WATCHING. UNITED NATIONS MET TO DISCUSS HOW HELP COULD BE SENT TO HAITI. THAT IS WHEN THEY AGREED KENYA WOULD PROVIDE THE SECURITY FORCE. NOW, INSIDE KENYA, THERE IS DEBATE WITH THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT SENDING THESE PEACEKEEPING OFFICERS TO HAITI AND THAT IS WHERE THE PRIME MINISTER TRAVELED THERE MEANWHILE IN HAITI. A LOCAL GANG LEADERA- I POWERFUL, KNOWN GANG LEADER, KNOWN AS BARBEQUE. HE IS VOWING TO HAVE THE PRIME MINISTER TO STEP DOWN AND TAKE CONTROL OF HAITI. HE WAS ONE OF THE LEADERS THAT ORGANIZED WHAT HAPPENED OVER THE WEEKEND. IT WILL BE DIFFICULT FOR ANY FORCE TO TAKE CONTROL NOW. THIS GANG LEADER DOES NOT WANT THE KENYA POLICE FORCE TO COME INTO HAITI. THAT IS ONE EFFORT THINGS HE HAS BEEN OPPOSING. HE BELIEVES THEY WILL COME IN TO SERVE THE PRIME MINISTER WHO. HE STANDS AGAINST A CHAOTIC SITUATION. >>. THANK YOU FOR THAT REPORTING. >>>. LET'S GET YOU TO THE FIVE THINGS OUR TEAM THINKS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT NUMBER ONE, FORMER CFO OF THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION PLEADING GUILTY TO TWO COUNTS OF PERJURY TODAY IN CONNECTION WITH THE TEMPERATURE THAT WAS GIVEN DURING TRUMP'S CIVIL FRAUD TRIAL, ONE SOURCE SAYING THAT HE WAS NOT EXPECTED TO ENTER INTO AN AGREEMENT TO TESTIFY AT A FUTURE TRIAL. MORE THAN 100 INDIGENOUS WOMEN ARE SUING DENMARK FOR $6 MILLION BECAUSE DENMARK FORCED THEM TO GET IUDs DECADES AGO WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT. WE TALKED ABOUT IT ON THE SHOW BEFORE HEALTH OFFICIALS VIOLATED THEIR HUMAN RIGHTS. OFFICIALS IN GROWN LAND HAS NOT RESPONDED. SOUP DUMPLINGS FROM TRADER JOE'S RECALLED. THEY SAY THE RECALL HAS A BEST BUY DATE OF MARCH 2nd. THROW THEM AWAY. DO NOT EAT THOSE DUMPLINGS OR RETURN THEM.

THE 76-YEAR-OLD IS GOING TO LAY LOW UNTIL NEXT MONDAY, WHEN SHE WILL REPRESENT THE CROWN NUMBER 5.. EMOTIONAL DAY. EMOTIONAL DAY FOR JASON KELCE, FOR THE EAGLES FAMILY: WORST KEPT SECRET RIGHT- WE HAVE KNOWN IT OFFICIALLY RETIRING FROM THE NFL. WATCH A LITTLE BIT OF THERE AND SEE IF YOU CAN NOT CRY. SEE IF YOU CAN NOT CRY. >> I AM PROUD BACK TO THIS DAY. [CRYING] >>. OH, MAN KISSING HIS WIFE THERE. KYLIE- WHAT A PLAYER. WHAT AN ATHLETE. WHAT A COUPLE. WHAT A CHAMPION HE IS. HE IS A CHAMPION. HE PLAYED FOR THE EAGLES FOR HIS ENTIRE CAREER, 13 YEARS. HE SAID: THANK YOU, PHILLY, FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART. THANK YOU, KELCE. YOU ARE ICONIC AND ALWAYS WILL BE ICONIC. WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY? I AM AN EAGLES FAN. IT TOUCHES ME. IT GETS TO YOU YOU KNOW EAGLES FAN AND A POLITICAL REPORT. THAT IS WHY WE WILL TALK ABOUT SUPER TUESDAY. WE ARE 12 HOURS AWAY NOW, MAYBE 13 OR SO, FROM THE FIRST POLLS OPENING. IT IS THE BIGGEST DAY OF THE PRIMARY CHALLENGER, JUST IN TERMS OF SHEER. NUMBER OF PEOPLE VOTING LOOK AT THE MAP: 16 STATES PLUS AMERICA. SAMOA, SEA TO SHINING SEA, COAST TO COST. PICK YOUR PHRASE. THAT IS WHO IS VOTING HERE? TOMORROW, SUPER TUESDAY, COULD BE A SPRINGBOARD >>. IT IS THE SINGLE BIGGEST ELECTION DAY ON THE PRIMARY CALENDAR: SUPER TUESDAY. VOTERS REPRESENTING STATES WITH 134 MILLION PEOPLE, HALF OF THE COUNTRY. IT WILL BE THE CLIMAX OF THE SEASON WHEN THE COMPETITION THINNING OUT LIKE IN 2020, BACKING JOE BIDEN, THE DRAMA LESS INTENSE THIS TIME, PRESIDENT BIDEN, NO SERIOUS CHALLENGE. AND THERE ARE TWO LEFT ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE: DONALD TRUMP AND NIKKI HALEY. FOR HALEY, IT MAY BE MAKE OR BREAK. >> GOING TO KEEP GOING THROUGH- SUPER TUESDAY: THAT IS AS FAR AS I THOUGHT IN TERMS OF GOING FORWARD. >> THAT PROMISE HOURS BEFORE. SHE LOST HER HOME STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA. SHE LOST SEVEN STATES THAT VOTED SO FAR BY A TWO THIRDS TO ONE MARGIN. HER ONLY WIN. WASHINGTON DC: 2,000 PEOPLE VOTED HALEY WITH KRISTEN WELKER. >>. CAN WE STAY COMPETITIVE WHEN 70% OF AMERICANS SAY THEY DON'T WANT DONALD TRUMP OR JOE BIDEN, YOU KEEP GOING TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE A CHOICE? >>. 270 DELEGATES. NIKKI HALEY: 43.. IN STATES, JUST GETTING SOME VOTES WILL NOT HELP HER AT ALL. SOME GIVE ALL OF THE DELEGATES FOR THE BURN THAT WINS 50% OF THE VOTE, LIKE TRUMP HAS DONE IN EVERY STATE SO FAR. BUT TECHNICALLY, THE REPUBLICAN RACE WILL NOT BE OVER AFTER TOMORROW NIGHT BECAUSE, EVEN IF TRUMP HAS A GANGBUSTERS EVENING, HE CAN NOT HIT THE NUMBER 1,215.. THAT COULD COME AS EARLY AS NEXT WEEK. NEXT WEEK, THAT OFSPECIAL COVERAGE PICKS UP RIGHT HERE TOMORROW, 5:00 EASTERN, WITH MYSELF AND TOM LLAMAS AND LESTER HOLT. THAT WILL LEAD OUR SPECIAL REPORTING ON NBC AT 10:00 EASTERN, AND KRISTEN WELKER PICKS IT UP AFTER. THAT. JUST GET READY, GET READY. IT WILL BE INTENSE, IT WILL BE AMAZING. >>>. WHEN WE COME BACK RAISING QUESTIONS ABOUT POWER AND ACCESS FOR CHINA'S TOP LEADERS, TAKE A LOOK HOW THESE HORSES WENT RUNNING WILD, THAT IS A SOFT GALLOP. OH, THAT IS A FULL GALLOP. >>. THE FIRST WOMAN ON A LUNAR MISSION. >> MORNING NEWS NOW STREAMING WEEKNIGHTS AT 7:00.. >>>. NBC NEWS COVERS HUNDREDS OF STORIES EVERY DAY, BECAUSE IT CAN BE TOUGH TO READ OR WATCH OR LISTEN TO THEM. ALL OUR TEAMS HAVE DONE IT FOR YOU. THIS IS WHAT IS GOING DOWN IN THEIR REGIONS. CALLED THE LOCALS PASSENGERS ON THE ALASKA AIRLINES PLANE WHERE THE DOOR FLEW OFF. THEY ARE SUING THE AIRLINE AND BOEING FOR $1 BILLION, SUING BOTH FOR NEGLIGENCE, FOR IGNORING WARNING SIGNS. BOWING AND ALASKA AIRLINES DECLINED TO COMMENT. THEY ARE STILL INVESTIGATING WHAT HAPPENED. >>>. UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND IS SUSPENDING GREEK LIFE AFTER REPORTS OF UNSAFE ACTIVITY. IN A LETTER, THE SCHOOL TELLING FRAT SORORITIES TO STOP RECRUITING OR HAVING EVENTS WITH. EXACTLY THIS LETTER DOES NOT USE THE WORD PLEASING, BUT IT REFERENCES STUFF THAT THREATENS THE SAFETY AND WELL BEING OF STUDENTS. MIDWEST OH, A DIFFERENT KIND OF HORSEPOWER GUYS ON THE HIGHWAY. DO YOU GET IT? IT IS ACTUAL HORSES. TWO POLICE HORSES THAT APPARENTLY GOT LOOSE DURING A ROUTINE EXERCISE. THERE THEY GO A LITTLE BIT OF A TROT. A TROT ACROSS THE HIGHWAY. THAT IS SCARY FOR THE HORSES, OBVIOUSLY DISRUPTIVE TO TRAFFIC SOME OTHER POLICE OFFICERS ON HORSEBACK, CAUGHT UP WITH THEM AND GOT THOSE HORSES HOME SAFE ROUNDED THEM UP, GOT THEM BACK A LITTLE BIT OF A WILD RUSH THERE >>> OVER SEAS. NOW A SURPRISE NEWS. NOW WITH BEIJING SAYING: FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 30 YEARS, THEY WILL NOT TALK TO REPORTERS. F YOU ARE LIKE, SO WHAT? IT IS A BIG DEAL. NOT MANY OPPORTUNITIES FOR JOURNALISTS TO QUESTION TOP CHINESE LEADERS BUT FOR THIS THING THAT HAPPENS YEARLY, THE GOVERNMENT HAS DECLARED, IT SAYS, THE COMMITMENT TO TRANSPARENCY AND THE FOSTERING OF FRIENDLY BUSINESS VICE PRESIDENT EVEN AS THE CHINESE PRESIDENT CONSOLIDATES ITS POWER AND PUSHES THEM IN LESS VISIBLE ROLES. LET'S BE CLEAR: NOT AS IF CHINA IS TRANSPARENT, BUT NOW ONE OF THOSE RARE OPPORTUNITIES TO HOLD POWER TO ACCOUNT IS GONE. >>. Reporter. THAT IS RIGHT SENDING THE SIGNAL. NOW CHINA TOP LEADERS DON'T WANT TO ANSWER TOUGH QUESTIONS FROM JOURNALISTS. THIS TRADITION DATED BACK TO 1993.. REAL MARQUISE EVENT OF THE PARLIAMENT SUMMARY, A LOT OF THE QUESTIONS WERE SCREENED IN ADVANCE. THERE WERE OPPORTUNITIES TO ASK THE CHINESE PREMIERE ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS, VIOLATIONS AND CHALLENGES WITH THE ECONOMY, WHICH MAY BE WHY THEY DON'T HAVE TO HAVE IT THIS YEAR AND IN THE COMING YEARS, BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMY IT REALLY HAS BEEN SUFFERING: MASSIVE REAL ESTATE CRISIS, DIMINISHING FOREIGN INVESTMENT AND ECONOMIC GROWTH RATES THAT ARE SLOWING. SO IT WILL AVERT THE NEED FOR CHINESE LEADERS TO HAVE TO ANSWER REALLY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FINANCIAL INDICATORS IN THE STATE OF THEIR ECONOMY. OF COURSE, IT ALSO REALLY REFLECTS THE FACT THAT PRESIDENT XI HAS CONSOLIDATED POWER. THE ROLL IN THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT IS NOT AS POWERFUL AS IT USED TO BE. >>. THE OTHER PIECE OF THIS TOO, THE WAY THAT WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE WE TALKED ABOUT IT, COLLEAGUES, THE IDEA OF SHIFTING SOME PERSPECTIVES ON CHINESE SOCIAL MEDIA, REGULATING DISCUSSION OF THE CHANGE THERE. HOW DO YOU SEE IT FITTING IN THE BIGGER PICTURE? AGAIN, I THINK IT IS DIFFERENT FOR AMERICAN VIEWERS, WHO CAN LARGELY GET ON SOCIAL MEDI PLATFORMS AND AND HAVING IT NOT APPEAR BECAUSE OF THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT WANT IT TO. GOVERNMENT DOES NOT WANT IT TO. THEY WERE LOOKING FOR IT. IT IS EYE CHRONIC, ONE OF THE EMBLEMS OF CHINA'S CLAIM, AS IT IS MOVING TOWARDS TRANSPARENCY FOR THE SYSTEM. IT WANTS TO BE OPEN TO THE REST OF THE WORLD, ESPECIALLY THE BUSINESS AND FOREIGN INVESTMENT. THE MERE FACT: THEY ARE SHUTTING DOWN THE NEWS CONFERENCE. THEY DID NOT WANT PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT IT. WE SEE THE CLEAR RESISTANCE >>. JOSH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR UNPACKING ALL OF THAT FOR US. TONIGHT SUPER INTERESTING: COMING OUT OF CHINA, APPRECIATE IT. >>>. COMING UP: LeBRON, JAMES AND DRAKE BETTING BIG ON THE PGA TOUR. THEIR MOVE MAY BE MORE IMPORTANT THAN JUST THE MONEY >>> BIGGER PICTURE: WHY IS IT SO TOUGH RIGHT NOW? >>>. SO LeBRON AND DRAKE ARE COMING TO USE THEIR MARKETING POWER AND, BY THE WAY, THEIR POWERFUL MONEY TO JOIN A BIG PUSH TO HELP THE PGA TOUR FEND PUSH TO HELP THE PGA TOUR. FEND OFF COMPETITION FROM LIV GOLF. WE BEEN COVERING THIS: A BUNCH GIVING MILLIONS TO THE BIGGEST NAMES IN GOLF. NOW, WHEN YOU FLIP ON A PGA, NOW, WHEN YOU FLIP ON A PGA TOURNAMENT, YOU MAY NOT SEE PHIL MICKELSON, JOHNSON RAHM. YOU SEE THE WINNINGEST PLAYERS IN GOLF. NOW, WHAT IS INTERESTING WHAT LeBRON AND DRAKE? THEY ARE INVESTORS. THEY SAY: WHAT DOES IT MEAN IN MONEY MARKETING TIME TO COMBAT WHEN LIV HAS TRIED TO DO HERE >>. THEY HAVE MONEY, BUT THE BIGGER STORY WITH THESE TWO ICONS IS JUST BRINGING THE POWER OF THEIR POPULARITY TO IT, AS WELL. WHAT WE KNOW IS THERE IS A BIG MATCH RIGHT IN TERMS OF WHO CAN GET THE MOST MONEY TO BRING IN THE BIG NAMES OF THE GOLFING WORLD ITSELF. LIV HAS SAUDI MONEY AND PGA NEEDS THE MONEY AS WELL. YOU HAVE THE MONEY, BUT THE IDEA IS USE THEIR NAMES TO BRING POPULARITY TO THE P DPRKS A TOUR, AS WELL. LeBRON HAS THE CONNECTEDNESS FOR THE GLOBAL SPORTS WORLD BECAUSE OF THE POPULARITY AND DRAFF OBVIOUSLY MONEY ON MY MIND, MIND ON MY MONEY, SO HE MIGHT BE COURTSIDE POPULAR OF BEING ON THE SIDE OF RAPTOR GAMES >>. SO WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR THE MERGER NEWS? THE IDEA OF PG A AND LIV >> PENDING MERGER >>. WE DON'T KNOW HOW IT WILL WORK OUT. THERE IS A GAME PLAN, AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THEM TO MERGE, SUPPOSED TO BE DONE BY DECEMBER 31st. THEY HAVE BEEN HOLDING IT OFF, SO IT IS INTERESTING. YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE PENDING MERGER. DON'T KNOW HOW IT IS GOING TO GO. PGA HAS TO PREPARE. >>. SO IT WILL NOT HAPPEN. IF IT HAPPENS, HOW WILL YOU FUND YOURSELF? THAT IS WHY THEY HAVE THE MONEY- $3 BILLION COMMITMENT FROM THE SPORTS GROUP. MAYBE IT IS THE RAINY DAY FUND AND THE SLEEP UTOF THESE TWO MASSIVE ICONS. AS WELL, WE WILL SEE HOW IT WORKS OUT. >>. WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE SAYING THE IDEA BEING LeBRON DRAKE, THIS FUND, TRYING TO COMPETE WITH ALL OF THAT SAUDI MONEY THAT LIV HAS >> YES, IT WILL IMPORTANT IF THE MERGER DOES NOT GO THROUGH. I GUESS IF IT GOES THROUGH, THEY WILL STILL HAVE THEM SHOWING UP BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, THEY HAVE TO DO A LITTLE BIT OF PLANNING IF YOU WILL. IN CASE, IT DOES NOT END UP HAPPENING AT ALL. >>. GREAT TO SEE NEW PERSON IN NEW YORK HERE. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE, FRIEND. >>>. ANOTHER GAME CHANGER, THIS ONE FOR THE WORLD OF COLLEGE SPORTS. HOW A UNION PUSH AT ONE IVY LEAGUE SCHOOL CAN SEE THE END OF THE NCAA AS WE KNOW IT >> GO AHEAD. >>>. KRISTEN WELKER HOSTS ""MEET THE PRESS"" EVERY SUNDAY ON NBC. >>>. SO TO TONIGHT'S ORIGINAL IN-DEPTH REPORTING, WITH MARCH MADNESS COMING UP QUICKLY. WE COULD SEE AN ELECTION CHANGE. SPORTS FOREVER- NOT SUPER TUESDAY, NOT SUPER TUESDAY. THIS ONE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, WHEN DARTMOUTH MIGHT FORM THE FIRST EVER UNION IN COLLEGE SPORTS, THE RESULTS WILL STAY HIDDEN. SO TO SPEAK WHILE THEY APPEAL, IT IS A BIG SHIFT IF IT HAPPENS THAT COULD ESSENTIALLY HAPPENS, THAT COULD ESSENTIALLY END THE NCAA AS WE KNOW IT >>. Reporter. THEY ARE LIKE EVERY OTHER STUDENT AT DARTMOUTH. IT DOES NOT COME WITH A PAYCHECK. WHY? >> THEY ARE ON THE BASKETBALL TEAM. >> WE DO NOT GET ANY BENEFITS FOR BEING ATHLETES. EVEN THOUGH, WE ARE WORKING FULL TIME JOBS BY BEING ON THE TEAM. >> THE ONLY WAY COLLEGE ATHLETES CAN GET MONEY THROUGH: NAME, IMAGE AND LIKENESS, AUTOGRAPHS, APPEARANCES, MERCH, JUST NOT WHAT THEY DO ON THE FIELD. SOME LIKE THIS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LSU CAN GET BIG BUCKS. THE OPPORTUNITIES DO NOT EXIST FOR EVERY ATHLETE. THAT IS WHY THEY DECIDED TO FORM A UNION TO GET COMPENSATED LIKE OTHER STUDENT EMPLOYEES, WITH HOURLY WAGES SIMILAR TO OTHER STUDENT WAGES ON CAMPUS OR SCHOLARSHIPS, BOTH PLAYER, HIS TO TAKE ON WHAT ARE THIRD JOBS. HE HAS EXPERIENCE WITH UNIONS THOUGH HELPING START ONE AT THE DINING HALL ON CAMP NEWS. WE SAW THE IMPACT AND HOW THEIR VOICES BECAME ONCE THEY BECAME A UNION, THERE WAS A LOT MORE POWER. >> ATHLETES TRIED THIS BEFORE. >> WE ARE SEEKING TO FORM A LABOR UNION. >>. Reporter. BACK IN 2015, THEY REJECTED NORTH WESTERN FOOTBALL TO FORM A UNION. A DECADE LATER, A SHIFT. NOW THE NLRB IS BACKING THEIR BID RULING. THE MEN'S BASKETBALL TEAM PERFORMS WORK IN EXCHANGE FOR COMPENSATION IN THE FORM OF GEAR, FOOD, LODGING TICKETS. SINCE IVY LEAGUE, ATHLETES DO NOT GET SCHOLARSHIPS. THE COST OF DARTMOUTH ATHLETIC PROGRAM FAR EXCEED THE REVENUE FOR THE PROGRAM BUT THEY HAVE THEIR SIGHTS SET ON SOMETHING BIGGER, OVERTURNING THE WHOLE SYSTEM. >>. AT THE CORE OF ALL OF THIS, IT CHALLENGES THE TERM THAT WE SEE SO OFTEN IN THE CONFERENCE OF YOU GUYS BEING STUDENT ATHLETES. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT TERM? DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT? >> I MEAN NO. IT IS AN OLD TERM. I REFUSE TO PUT THE STUDENT FIRST AND THE FACT THAT THEY ACTUALLY DO WORK FOR THE COLLEGE >>. Reporter. SPORTS LAW EXPERT SAYS THESE RULINGS COULD PUT THE ENTIRE NCAA ON NOTICE. >>. IT IS A GAME CHANGER FOR COLLEGE SPORTS, A SHIFT IN THE NCAA MODEL FROM A MODEL WHEREBY RULE: THE SCHOOLS CAN NOT PAY THE ATHLETES AND THAT MAKES THEM AMATEURS. COLLEGE PLAYERS HAVE A BIG ROLE IN TERMS OF GENERATING REVENUE, GENERATING FUNDRAISING, GENERATING ADMISSIONS. SCHOOLS MIGHT RETHINK SOME OF THEIR NUMBERS. >>. THE NCAA HAS NOT RESPONDED. THEY HAVE THE KEY FACTOR WORKING IN THEIR FAVOR: PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE NOT COVERED BY THE NLRB. NO SIGN THAT THEY CAN FORM UNIONS, YET THE OTHERS ARE PRIVATE, LEAVING THEM WIDE OPEN TO TAKE THAT STEP >>. THEY ARE BRINGING TOGETHER THE WHOLE IVY LEAGUE >>. WE ARE NOT THE ONLY ONE FRUSTRATED BY IVY LEAGUE. WITH OUR OWN SCHOOL, EVERYONE FEELS USED IN THE IVY LEAGUE. WE WANT TO CHANGE THAT >>. Reporter. NOW YOU SAW HER IN THOSE INTERVIEWS. LAURA, A POLITICAL TIE IN THERE TOO. EXPLAIN THAT >>. Reporter, ALWAYS A POLITICAL TIE IN RIGHT HALLIE >>. IF YOU DID NOT KNOW, THE PRESIDENT OF THE NCAA IS CHARLIE, REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR. REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR, POLITICAL FIRE THAT IS USED TO NAVIGATING BIG CHANGE. THE NCAA THAT IS RESISTANT TO THAT KIND OF CHANGE. IT WAS A VERY LIBERAL MASSACHUSETTS. HE IS WORKING ON THREADING THE NEEDLE TO BALANCE BOTH SIDES. WHAT IS MORE IS THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES ACTUALLY ACCUSES THE GENERAL COUNSEL. WE KNOW THAT PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN IS VERY FAVORABLE TO THE UNIONS. THIS COULD DRAG ON WELL PAST ELECTION SEASON. HE HASN'T TAKEN A STANCE ON THE PARTICULAR ISSUE BUT THEY COULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THIS ULTIMATE DECISION, DEPENDING ON WHAT WE SEE IN NOVEMBER. THAT STORY WE APPRECIATE IT. THAT DOES IT FOR US THIS HOUR. WE'VE GOT MORE COVERAGE PICKING UP RIGHT NOW. UP RIGHT NOW. SONG THAT >>> TONIGHT. WHAT YOU COULD CALL A 2024 WIN FOR FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. FIRST THE DECISION COMING DOWN FROM THE SUPREME COURT TO KEEP THE FORMER PRESIDENT ON THE BALLOT IN ALL 50 STATES AND WHY THEY MADE THAT CALL AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE WHITE HOUSE PLACE >>>. WE ARE JUST HOURS FROM THE FIRST PRIMARY OPENING OUR TEAM ON THE TRAIL. COVERING WOULD COULD BE NIKKI HALEY'S LAST STAND. EVERYTHING YOU WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT SUPER TUESDAY COMING UP PLUS PEOPLE RECOVER FROM ABSOLUTELY WILD WEATHER, CALIFORNIA, DIGGING OUT UP TO 10 FEET OF SNOW. THEY ARE STRUGGLING TO CONTAIN THE WORST FOREST FIRE IN THAT STATE'S HISTORY >>> MORE SHIFTS IN THE WHITE HOUSE. WHAT THE ISRAELIS ARE SAYING ABOUT THE LATEST PUSH FOR A PAUSE IN FIGHTING >>> IN HAITI. SERIOUS WARNING FOR AMERICANS: GET OUT NOW. A MASSIVE GANG-RELATED PRISON BREAK PUTTING US OFFICIALS ON HIGH ALERT IN THE COUNTRY ON THE VERGE OF A FULL ON COLLAPSE. THAT IS COMING UP A LITTLE LATER ON IN THE STORE -- SHOW HEY THERE. I AM HAILLE THE SUPREME COURT HANDED HIM WHAT IS BASICALLY A WIN FOR US. 24 CAMPAIGN LISTEN >>. ESSENTIALLY, YOU CANNOT TAKE SOMEBODY OUT OF A RACE BECAUSE AN OPPONENT WOULD LIKE TO HAVE IT THAT WAY, WHILE MOST STATES WERE THRILLED DIDN'T COME, AND THEY DIDN'T WANT THAT FOR POLITICAL REASONS >>. THE SUPREME COURT RULING UNANIMOUSLY THAT DONALD TRUMP SHOULD STAY ON THE BALLOT IN COLORADO, ON THE PRIMARY BALLOT. IF THEY HAD GONE THE OTHER WAY, THE WHOLE PRESIDENTIAL RACE COULD HAVE GONE INTO CHAOS THERE, WHETHER THE PRESIDENT ESSENTIALLY ORGANIZED, AND INSIDE A MOB. ON JANUARY 6th, SIX COLORADANS WHO SUED ISSUED YES. THEY DO AGREE THAT INDIVIDUAL STATES SHOULD AN THE ABLE TO KICK CANDIDATES OFF THE BALLOT. IF THEY ARE RUNNING FOR FEDERAL OFFICE ADVANCE INSTRUCTIONS FROM HOLDING OFFICE, THEY BASICALLY SAY IT COULD BE A HOT MESS. IT COULD BE TAKEN OFF THE BALLOT IN SOME STATES, BUT NOT OTHERS. THIS DECISION DOESN'T JUST KEEP HIM ON THE BALLOT IN COLORADO, BUT IN ILLINOIS ALSO. SIMILAR CASES HAVE COME UP. THE TIMING IS KEY, RIGHT, COLORADO IS ONE OF THE STATES DEVILS. TOMORROW, ON SUPER TUESDAY- SO IS MAINE, BY THE WAY. I WANT TO START WITH OUR KEN DILANIAN, WHO IS BACK HOME FOR US IN WASHINGTON. A UNANIMOUS DECISION, KEN, IT WASN'T NECESSARILY UNANIMOUS. THINKING RIGHT, TALK US THROUGH SOME OF THE SUBTLETIES HERE. >>. THAT IS RIGHT HAILLE. THIS COURT IS SPLIT. THE MAJORITY DECIDED THAT ONLY AN ACT OF CONGRESS COULD ENFORCE THIS, THE THREE LIBERAL JUSTICE, JOINED BY TONY BARRETT, WHO SAID THAT WENT TOO FAR. OTHER POTENTIAL AVENUES OF ENFORCEMENT. FOR EXAMPLE, SOMEONE FOLLOWED A FEDERAL LAWSUIT. THEY COULD, IN THEORY, PREVENT HIM FROM BEING ON THE BALLOT AND NOT BE IN THIS STATE-BY- STATE ISSUE. THE MAJORITY WASN'T HAVING IT. THE LIBERALS WERE ALMOST ANNOYED BY THAT. I WANT TO BRING YOU AN EXTRA FROM THAT OPINION. THEY SAID IT ONLY INVOLVED A SINGLE QUESTION: WHETHER AN INDIVIDUAL STATE MAY KEEP A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE WHO ENGAGED IN INSURRECTION IN HIS BALLOT. WITH THIS RESTRAINT, IT ABANDONED THAT. >>. IT IS AN IMPORTANT DECISION. KEN THE SUPREME COURT. THINK ABOUT THE SUPREME COURT. IN POLITICS. THE SUPREME COURT HAS MORE REALLY BIG DECISIONS COMING UP. AT LEAST ONE OF THEM. IT IS THE PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY CASE WE ARE ALSO LOOKING AT. THERE ARE KEY ARGUMENTS. IT WILL BE ALL EYES ON THE POTENTIAL DECISION THERE >>. YES, THAT IS RIGHT ALREADY. BY THEIR ACTIONS, HOW THEY TOOK THIS CASE, THEY MADE IT VERY CONTROVERSIAL. ONLY 31% OF AMERICANS ACCORDING TO POLL APPROVE OF THE POLITICS. THIS IS, OF COURSE, TURNING DOWN. SPECIAL COUNSEL JEFF SMITH'S URGING OF THIS DECISION. THEY WAIVED THE RULE. NOW THEY ARE TAKING IT UP IN APRIL. THEY WILL NOT BE ROLLING UNTIL JUNE. THAT SUBSTANTIALLY DELAYS THE POTENTIAL CRIMINAL TRIAL AGAINST MR TRUMP ON THOSE ALLEGATIONS THAT HE TRIED TO OVERTURN THE ELECTION. THAT HAS AN IMPACT ON THE ELECTION. IT SHOWS THAT THE COURT IS PLAYING A SIGNIFICANT ROLE. IT IS NOT A ROLE THAT THE COURT WELCOMES, BUT IT HAS BEEN PLAYED. NONETHELESS >>. KEN DILANIAN IN WASHINGTON, THANKS ALL ALONG, GARRETT. YOU'VE AT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN TALKING ABOUT THE IDEA OF THIS BETWEEN THE POLITICAL AND -- CALENDAR BASED ON YOUR REPORTING. IT IS ALL ONE CALENDAR, RIGHT >>. Reporter. YEAH, TODAY IS A PRETTY GOOD EXAMPLE OF THAT. IT IS THE DAY BEFORE SUPER TUESDAY. CALIFORNIA, ARKANSAS, MINNESOTA- ANYTHING THAT WILL AWARD DELEGATES. HE IS HERE IN FLORIDA TODAY. HIS ONLY CAMPAIGN RELATED ACTIVITY WAS THIS CONFERENCE HE GAVE IN RESPONSE TO THE COLORADO DECISION. HE TALKED ABOUT COLORADO ONLY VERY BRIEFLY. AFTER THAT HE PUT TOGETHER ALL THE VARIOUS LEGAL CASES AGAINST HIM OR FEATURING HIM INTO ONE OVERARCHING ARGUMENT THAT HE IS SOMEHOW BEING INTERFERED WITH ON HIS QUEST FOR THE WHITE HOUSE, AND HE STARTED WORKING THEM. WHAT HE SEES AS THE MOST IMPORTANT IN BOTH CASES: THE QUESTION OVER WHETHER HE WOULD HAVE PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY IN THE TWO BIG FEDERAL CASES. HERE'S WHAT HE HAD TO SAY ABOUT THAT AND THE SUPREME COURT >>. IF THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T HAVE FULL IMMUNITY, YOU REALLY DON'T HAVE A PRESIDENT. A PRESIDENT HAS TO BE FREE, A PRESIDENT HAS TO BE -- IF THE PRESIDENT DOES A GOOD JOB, I DID: >> OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A CASE THAT IS ON WHICH ALL THE OTHER CASES HANDS HAILLE, WHETHER HE HAS IMMUNITY, A KEY FOCUS POLITICALLY AS WE MOVE INTO THE SUMMER AND THE FALL, POSSIBLY THE START OF THESE TRIAL DATES >>, AND AS WE TALK ABOUT- YOU SAID THIS RIGHT AT THE START. THERE HE IS, WHERE YOU ARE IN SOUTH FLORIDA, HERE FOR SUPER TUESDAY. HE IS NOT NECESSARILY ON A CAMPAIGN TRAIL. HE IS TRYING TO CAST HIS EYES AHEAD TO THE GENERAL ELECTION, VERSUS JOE BIDEN EVEN WHILE NIKKI HALEY IS STILL IN THIS RACE TALK ABOUT THIS FROM THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN >> THAT IS RIGHT. THERE ARE COUPLE THINGS AT PLAY HERE. THEY KNOW MATHEMATICALLY THEY CANNOT CLINCH THE NOMINATION >> THAT'S RIGHT >>. Reporter. ALTHOUGH THEY THINK THE SWEEP IS BETWEEN LIKELY AND POSSIBLE. THEY'RE PRETTY LIKELY ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF SLEEPING. THEY WANT TO KIND OF PUSH NIKKI HALEY EVEN FURTHER OUT OF THE NATIONAL CONVERSATION SO THEY CAN FOCUS MORE ON JOE BIDEN AND THE GENERAL. THERE IS, IN PART, A FINANCIAL DECISION. THIS VERSION OF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS MUCH LESS INCLINED TO HAVING THOSE MEGA RALLIES THAT MAKE FOR GOOD TELEVISION AND GOOD EGO MANAGEMENT FOR THE CANDIDATE BUT ARE NOT NECESSARILY SUPER EFFECTIVE WAYS TO TURN OUT VOTERS WHERE THEY NEED THEM. THEY WILL NOT DO THAT KIND OF THING. RIGHT NOW IN THE HOPES OF STEWARDING THEIR RESOURCES, THAT EVERY DATA PLOY WE HAVE CAN BE EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE. >>. GARRETT HAAKE LIVE FOR US IN SOUTH FLORIDA. LET ME BRING IN ALI VITALI NOW, WHO WAS IN ONE OF THOSE SUPER DATES- TEXAS -- FROM SINGH TRUMP LOOKING AT THE POTENTIAL MAYBE FOR A SWEEP. TELL ME ABOUT WHAT YOU ARE HEARING FROM YOUR SOURCES AND FROM NIKKI HALEY'S TEAM >>. Reporter. IT SEEMS VERY LIKELY HAILLE, NIKKI HALEY'S TEAMS, SEES THE POLL WE ARE ALL SEEN. THEY SEEM TO SAY THAT THERE WERE SOME INTERNAL METRICS THEY WERE HOPING TO HIT. SHE WAS ALSO SAYING THAT SHE WASN'T WILLING TO SHARE WHAT THOSE WERE. HONESTLY, THAT IS HOW THE CAMPAIGN HAS OPERATED THAT ENTIRE TIME. THEY MIGHT HAVE THESE INTERNAL METRICS BUT THEY CERTAINLY DON'T SHARE THEM PUBLICLY. THAT IS WHY WE HAVEN'T SEEN HAILLE. -- HALEY OR HER MANAGER, SAID THAT THEY WILL WIN IN X. SAID THAT THEY WILL WIN IN X STATE OR Y STATE. IT ALSO DOESN'T DO MUCH TO STEM THE TIDE OF WHAT WE ARE SEEING FROM THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, WHICH IS LIKELY OR POSSIBLE TO BORROW GARRETT'S PHRASING THAT THEY WILL SWEEP IN SUPER TUESDAY. ALL THAT BEING SAID, IT DOESN'T STOP NIKKI HALEY FROM REACTING IN A WAY THAT FLORIDA BOLSTERS THE CAMPAIGN POSITION ON THINGS LIKE WITHOUT TODAY OUT OF THE SUPREME COURT. WATCH WHAT SHE SAID ABOUT THAT RULING. >>. WE DON'T EVER WANT SOME ELECTED OFFICIAL IN THE STATE OR ANYBODY ELSE SAYING WHO CAN OR CAN'T BE ON THE BALLOT. THIS IS AMERICA. THIS IS AMERICA. I WILL DEFEAT DONALD TRUMP SQUARE AND FAIR -- FAIR AND SQUARE. BUT I WANT HIM ON THAT BALLOT. >>. TRUMP DEFEATED HIM AT THE BALLOT BOX, BUT POLLS SHOW AGAIN HOW MUCH OF A LONGSHOT THAT IS. >>. THIS UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE OF BEING ON THE GROUND IS ACTING SURPRISED ABOUT THE POINT WHERE WE ARE NOW IN THIS RACE, ONE DAY NOW, 13 HOURS AHEAD OF SUPER TUESDAY >>. I REALLY ACTUALLY VERY SURPRISED ABOUT EFFECT THAT HALEY IS WILLING TO CRITICIZE TRUMP TO A POINT, THE FACT THAT SHE IS NOT WILLING TO GO ALL THE WAY THERE AS SHE'S, THAT SHE IS THE ALTERNATIVE AND TO SORT OF ACCEPT THE VOTERS WE NEED TO SAY THEY ARE VOTING FOR HALEY. YES, A LOT OF THEM LIKE THEM. THEY ARE ALSO VOTING AGAINST DONALD TRUMP. NIKKI HALEY TRIES TO DO THIS DANCE OF. I'M NOT THE ANTI TRUMP CANDIDATE, I'M JUST A DIFFERENT CANDIDATE. THE REALITY IS, IF YOU ARE NOT TRUMP AND YOU ARE RUNNING AGAINST HIM, YOU ARE THE ANTI- TRUMP CANDIDATE. THE FACT THAT HALEY IS STILL TRYING TO DANCE AROUND THAT AND BE DELICATE ABOUT THAT, I THINK IT IS SURPRISING TO ME. IT IS WHY HER LEAVING THE STORE OPEN ON. WILL SHE OR WON'T SHE ENDORSE PEOPLE CONTINUE TO PAY ATTENTION. IT MAKES THE WORDS CARRY MORE WEIGHT. AT THE SAME TIME, I THINK VOTERS NEED TO KNOW THAT. >> ARE YOU SOMEONE WHO WILL KEEP GOING TO PREVENT HIM FROM GETTING THIS NOMINATION BECAUSE YOU CAN'T WIN A GENERAL, WHICH IS REALLY THE ONLY ARGUMENT AT THIS POINT? DESPITE THE CHAMBER SIXTH OF IT ALL, DESPITE EVERYTHING ELSE. I DO THINK THAT SHE IS KEEPING THAT FOR A REASON. AT THE SAME TIME, IT IS PRETTY SURPRISING. SHE CAN'T ANSWER QUESTIONS LIKE I ASKED HER. COULD YOU VOTE FOR A CONVICTED CRIMINAL AT THE END OF THE DAY? >> ALI VITALI, ALLOW TO WATCH OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT 48- 72 HOURS. WE WILL BE WATCHING IT ALTOGETHER. WE WILL ALL BE THERE, STARTING TOMORROW MORNING ON NBC NEWS NOW, 5:00 EASTERN TIME. HOWEVER YOU ARE WATCHING, LEADING OUR COVERAGE ON THE NBC SIDE AT 10:00 IS RIGHT NOW: MILLIONS OF PEOPLE DIGGING THEMSELVES OUT AFTER A BLOCKBUSTER. THEY ARE USED TO SNOW IN SOME OF THE PARTS OF THE STATE. THIS IS 10 FEET OF SNOW IN SOME SPOTS 10 PLUS FEET, A CATEGORY FIVE HURRICANE MORE THAN 195 HOURS. THAT IS NOT THE NORM THIS TIME OF THE YEAR IN THIS LOCATION. LOOK AT THIS- CARS HAVING TO GET DRAGGED OUT. YOU HAD A BIG HIGHWAY SHUT DOWN, HOMES BURIED, AND NOW MORE SNOW ON THE WAY. ANOTHER 10 FEET OF SNOW ON THE WAY. AT LEAST THERE IS A SILVER LINING TO THIS HUGE CLOUD HANGING OVER YOUR STATE. TELL ME ABOUT WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN SEEING >>. Reporter. NOT ANOTHER 10 FEET BUT PEOPLE DON'T WANT ANOTHER INCH RIGHT NOW. THIS STORM WAS RIDICULOUS. I SAID IT BEFORE AND I WILL SAY IT AGAIN. IT WAS 72 HOURS OF PURELY CONSISTENT, SENSELESS SNOWFALL. SOMETIMES BLOWING SNOW FALL, SOMETIMES STRAIGHT DOWN BUT IT NEVER STOPPED ALMOST FOUR SINGLE SECOND: 5-10 FEET OF SNOW, AS YOU MENTIONED. AS YOU GO LOWER, THE TOTAL DROPS LOWER. YOU GO HIGHER, IT GOES HIGHER. 12 FEET IN THE MOUNTAIN AREAS, WITH OVER 100 MILE. AN HOUR WIND GUSTS. THAT IS UNHEARD OF. OF COURSE, THE WORST OF IT HAD TO BE ON THE ROAD. INTERSTATE 80 WAS JUST SLAMMED. ROELOFS ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, PEOPLE HAD TO ABANDONED CARS AND TRUCKS ON THE ROADS. THE CHP HIGHWAY PATROL HAD TO RESCUE PEOPLE OFF THE HIGHWAY. THEY LEFT EVERYTHING ON THE HIGHWAY, THEN SHUT IT DOWN FOR ABOUT THREE DAYS. THIS IS A MAJOR ARTERY SORT OF THE THING THAT CONNECTS THE ENTIRE MOUNTAIN REGION, THIS ONE INTERSTATE. IT WAS SHUT DOWN FOR THAT LONG. PEOPLE WERE ESSENTIALLY CUT OFF IN THEIR COMMUNITIES, SNOWED IN IN A LOT OF PLACES. THEY COULDN'T MOVE AROUND. THAT IS THE LEVEL STORM WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THANKFULLY, AS WE HAVE BEEN MENTIONING. IT IS KIND OF OVER. IT IS OVER BECAUSE THAT STORM IS GONE. ANOTHER SYSTEM IS ROLLING IN. I WOULDN'T CALL IT A STORM, BECAUSE IT WILL DROP. WE WILL GET ANOTHER FOOT OR TWO IN THE MOUNTAINS, LIKE WE'VE BEEN SAYING. A COUPLE OF INCHES IS NOT GOOD WHEN IT IS ON TOP OF 10 FEET. THAT IS ALREADY ON THE GROUND AND THE FLURRIES ARE STARTING TO DROP AS WE SPEAK. >> STAY WARM OUT THERE. I KNOW YOU AND SO MANY OTHERS WILL BE HOPING. THAT IS THE CASE. THANK YOU. >>>. TO TEXAS, ALSO HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ON THE WILDFIRE ALERTS. FIREFIGHTERS JUST CANNOT GET A HANDLE ON ONE OF THE BIGGEST BUYERS IN TEXAS' HISTORY. STRONG WINDS ARE KEEPING THIS THING GOING. IT IS SO BAD THAT THE GOVERNOR OF ANOTHER STATE IS SENDING THEIR NATIONAL GUARD INTO HELP. FIGHT THIS THING. MORE THAN 1 MILLION ACRES. LOOK AT THIS, BURNED TO A CRISP FIRE, AND SMOKE IS OFF TO THE DISTANCE. OUR MORGAN CHESKY IS JOINING US NOW. IT CAN BE HARD FOR PEOPLE TO WRAP THEIR HEAD AROUND THE SHEER SCOPE THE SIZE OF THIS THING. MORGAN, TALK US THROUGH IT. >>. Reporter. INCREDIBLY WELL SAID HAILLE. YOU CAN GET ON A BRIDGE HERE AND DRIVE FOR TWO HOURS TO CANADIAN TEXAS. THROUGHOUT THE MAJORITY OF THAT DRIVE. YOU WILL SEE CHARRED LANDSCAPES. THAT IS WHAT A BURNED AREA LOOKS LIKE WHEN IT CONSUMES MORE THAN 1 MILLION ACRES, WHICH IS WHAT THIS CREEK FIRE HAS DONE. MORE THAN FIVE HERE IN THE TEXAS PANHANDLE. LET'S LOOK AT IT. BY THE ACRES, MORE THAN 1 MILLION BURNED BUILDINGS THAT HAVE BEEN LOST. AS A RESULT, UNFORTUNATELY, TWO LIVES HAVE BEEN LOST FROM THIS FIRE THAT STARTED A WEEK AGO. TODAY, PRETTY MUCH, EVERY SINGLE DAY SINCE THEN, A NEW PORTION OF THE TEXAS PANHANDLE HAS BURNED. IT IS CERTAINLY LEAVING. EVERYONE FEELING THAT THEY ARE NOT EVEN OUT OF THE WOODS. EVEN THOUGH THE WINDS HAVE DIED DOWN. THERE IS SO MUCH FUEL AROUND HERE THAT CAN BURN. THAT HAS OFFICIALS SAYING THIS: TAKE A LIST. >>. IT IS INEVITABLE THAT WE WILL GET ANOTHER? >> Reporter. YOU BELIEVE THAT? >> WHETHER IT IS A POWER LINE, SOMEBODY DRAGGING A TRUCK, BACKFIRING SOMETHING OVER ANYTHING- JUST ONE SPARK. >> Reporter. JUST ONE SPARK. >> Reporter, AND SPEAKING OF POWERLINES, ONE WOMAN WHO LIVES IN CANADIAN TEXAS, WHO LOST HER HOME, IS NOW PURSUING A LAWSUIT AGAINST THE UTILITY PROVIDER. SHE IS SAYING THAT, BECAUSE THEY FAILED TO MAINTAIN A POWER POLE, IT FELL DOWN, SNAPPING AT ITS BASE, PUTTING THOSE POWERLINES CLOSE TO THE DRY GRASS, AND THE LAWSUIT ALLEGES THAT IS WHAT CAUSED THIS FIRE. THE FIRE CHIEF OF A NEIGHBORING COMMUNITY SAYS HIS TEAM DID OBSERVE AT LEAST ONE POWER POLE DOWN RIGHT AROUND THE TIME THIS FIRE BEGAN IN THE MEANTIME THERE WAS AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT FIRE. THAT PLAYED OUT LAST NIGHT, NOT TOO FAR FROM WHERE WE ARE IN NEIGHBORING SAMFORD. THE SMALL COMMUNITY HAD TO BE EVACUATED. HAILLE. THIS TOWN HAD TO BE EVACUATED FOR THE THIRD TIME FROM THE WILDFIRE IN LESS HAN A WEEK. THE STRESS OF THAT EVEN, WHEN THEY GO BACK HOME AND THEIR HOME IS FINE- THIS IS WEIGHING VERY HEAVILY ON EVERYONE HERE. >> MORGAN CHESKY RIDING THE THICK OF IT THERE- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT. >>> METEOROLOGIST BILL KARINS, YOU ARE TRACKING MORE SEVERE WEATHER RIGHT THERE IN THE MIDWEST, MAYBE TORNADOES? >> YES, WE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THE SLIGHT RISK. WE ARE WARMING UP. THEN WE GET THE STORMS THAT POP UP AT THE END OF THE AFTERNOON. ONCE THE SUN GOES DOWN, IT WILL START TO WEAKEN. THREE DIFFERENT TORNADOES ALL IN OPEN FIELD, NO DAMAGE. ONCE THE LILIES HAVE A CHANCE FOR SOME OF THAT. WE'VE HAD AREAS OF SEVERE WEATHER FROM MILWAUKEE ALL THE WAY DOWN. I DO SEE A NEW TORNADO JUST POPPED UP TOO. HERE IS THE MILWAUKEE AREA. YOU WILL SEE HEAVY RAIN AND THUNDERSTORMS ROLLING THROUGH, NOT A PRETTY DRIVE. I'M SURE THERE WILL BE A LOT OF PEOPLE SEEING HAIL. THE WARNING HAS JUST BEEN DROPPED. THERE IS ANOTHER ONE. THIS IS JUST OUTSIDE HERE AND I DID MENTIONED THAT OTHER ONE- THE NEW TORNADO WARNING AS WE HEAD, TOWARD, MISSOURI, ILLINOIS, BORDER. LET'S SEE IF ANYTHING GETS PRODUCED THAT SHOULD BE WEAKENING AS THE SUN GOES DOWN. THIS STORY WILL NOT GO AWAY UNTIL WE GET RAIN. IT WILL BE WINDY AGAIN AND A ZERO RAIN- PRACTICALLY ZERO RAIN- FOR THE NEXT SEVEN DAYS. WE REALLY WILL NEED A BIG RAINSTORM TO PUT ALL THE FIRES OUT. THAT WILL KIND OF END OUR BRUSHFIRE SEASON EARLY IN THE PLANE. THE STORM FOR THE WEST. THIS IS TRENDING GOOD. IT IS TRENDING NORTH IN AREAS NORTHERN OF THE SOUTHERN CASCADE. SOME OF THESE INCREDIBLE NUMBERS THAT WE SAW. EASILY THE BIGGEST STORM IN THE TAHOE AREA, RENO ALL THE WAY THROUGH, WHAT WAS REALLY IMPRESSIVE. THEY HAD 192 MILE AN HOUR WIND GUST. I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY MEASURE THESE NUMBERS- EPIC STORM. IT WILL JUST PUT IT THAT WAY. THE SNOW IS 15 FEET HIGH IN SOME PLACES. THE WINTER STORM WARNINGS HAVE BEEN DROPPED FOR TAHOE MAYBE JUST A COUPLE OF INCHES. THE SOUTHERN CASCADE, THEN EVENTUALLY HEADING TOWARD YELLOWSTONE. THERE IS JACKSON SUN VALLEY. THIS IS THE AREA EVERYONE WAS TRAVELING IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. IT SHOULDN'T BE TOO BAD, I KNOW INTERSTATE 80 WAS CLOSED. THE LAST COUPLE, DAYS CHANGE REQUIRED LITTLE BIT OF SNOW TONIGHT. HERE IS THE TIMING OF THIS. THIS STORM WILL EVENTUALLY HEAD DOWN THE CALIFORNIA COAST AND BRING RAIN TO AREAS LIKE SAN FRANCISCO AS WE GO THROUGH EARLY WEDNESDAY MORNING. AGAIN, NOT A HIGH IMPACT. THERE WILL KEEP AN EYE ON THE WEATHER. >>. YOU MENTION ALTHOUGH SKI AREAS. THERE IS ALSO A RISK THERE. WE'VE SEEN AVALANCHES THIS SEASON ALREADY. >>. YES, THERE ARE COUPLE OF AVALANCHE WARNINGS UP IF YOU DO. THE HEAVY SNOW ON TOP OF ICE OR TEMPERATURES WARM UP QUICKLY, THEN IT SOLIDIFIES, THEN IT JUST -- AS IT GOES. WE WILL SEE HOW IT PLAYS OUT. LET'S HOPE THEY CAN SKI. ENJOY IT AND BE SAFE. >>. THAT IS THE HOPE, BILL KARINS. THANK YOU. >>>. BACK HOME TO WASHINGTON. NOW WE'VE SEEN THE VICE PRESIDENT MEETING WITH THE TOP ISRAELI HOURS -- LEADERS LOOK. >>. INNOCENT CIVILIANS HAVE BEEN KILLED. WE NEED TO GET MORE AID IN AND THE HOSTAGES OUT. >>. WE ARE JUST GETTING VIDEO IN -- A KEY MEMBER OF THE WAR CABINET MEETING THERE ON CAPITOL HILL. THERE HE IS REMEMBER IN WASHINGTON NOW DEFYING THE ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER, BENJAMIN NETANYAHU. HE DID NOT WANT THEM TO SHOW UP HERE NOW YOU GOT A MEETING WITH MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, OBVIOUSLY TALKING WITH THE VICE PRESIDENT. THIS COMES JUST 24 HOURS AFTER. SHE CALLED FOR AN IMMEDIATE CEASE-FIRE, CRITICIZING ISRAEL FOR NOT DOING ENOUGH TO STOP THIS. IN HER WORDS, A HUMANITARIAN CATASTROPHE IN GAZA. PRESIDENT BIDEN, WILL TRY TO GET MORE HELP TO THOSE IN GAZA WHO NEED IT. 38,000 MEALS DROPPED INTO GAZA. TALK ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS MEETING BETWEEN VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS AND -- WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP RIGHT NOW? >>. YOU HAVE VICE PRESIDENT HERE IN THE KEY OPPOSITION LEADER IN ISRAEL TO THE PRIME MINISTER, BENJAMIN NETANYAHU AT THE SAME TIME. THAT OPPOSITION LEADER IS NOW A MEMBER OF THE WAR CABINET THAT WAS PUT TOGETHER AFTER THE HAMAS ATTACK ON OCTOBER 7th TO HAVE THESE TWO LEADERS MEETING TODAY THE ADMINISTRATION SAYS IS ENTERED ASPECT OF THE WAY THEY'VE BEEN OPERATING IN A SENSE SINCE OCTOBER 7th, WHEN BENNY GANTZ REACHED OUT SAYING HE WOULD LIKE TO MEET WITH OFFICIALS AT THE WHITE HOUSE. TODAY HE MET WITH THE VICE PRESIDENT AND, SEPARATELY, WITH THE NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER, JAKE SULLIVAN, AND ANOTHER DEPUTY ON THE SECURITY COUNCIL TO TALK ABOUT WHAT ISRAEL IS DOING ON THE GROUND IN GAZA- A KEY PART IN TERMS OF WHAT THE MILITARY OPERATIONS ARE, SOMETHING THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO KEEP AND ALSO SOME PERSPECTIVE OF FOR THE ISRAELIS. ALSO THE VICE PRESIDENT INDICATED IN SOME OF HER CALLOUTS SHE EXPRESSED DEEP CONCERN ABOUT THE HUMANITARIAN CONDITIONS IN GAZA AND THE SUFFERING THAT THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE HAVE BEEN IN DURING OVER THE LAST MANY MONTHS. OF COURSE, WE KNOW THERE WASN'T A DROP OVER THE WEEKEND OF THE UNITED STATES OTHER COUNTRIES THAT HAVE ALSO DROPPED AID INTO GAZA. ALSO A KEY PART OF THE CONVERSATION WITH THE PRESIDENT TODAY, WITH HOW ISRAEL NEEDED TO OPEN UP MORE WAYS FOR MORE AID- FOOD, MEDICINE AND THE LIKE- TO GET INTO GAZA BY AIR, BY GROUND AND POTENTIALLY BY SEA >>. IT IS THE POTENTIAL FOR MAYBE A POTENTIAL CEASE-FIRE. ANY GUIDANCE OR TIMELINE ON THAT QUICK >>. REPORTER. NO, YOUR MEMBER. LAST WEEK YOU SAID THERE MIGHT BE A DEAL DONE BY TODAY. THEN THE INCIDENT WITH AID: THE PEOPLE WHO WERE KILLED IN GAZA TRYING TO GET TO SOME OF THE AID THAT WAS COMING IN ON TRUCKS, HE SAID. HE THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE A SETBACK. IT SEEMS THOSE NOT NECESSARILY A SET BACK. THERE IS AN OFFER ON THE TABLE, THE BY DEMONSTRATION SAYS AT THIS POINT, IT IS AN OFFER THAT HAMAS NEEDS TO TAKE. ISRAEL HAS DONE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF ITS PART TO PUT OUT A DEAL FOR EVERYBODY INVOLVED. NOW THEY ARE JUST WAITING FOR HAMAS TO TAKE THE DEAL, SO THERE CAN BE A CEASE-FIRE, A HOSTAGE RELEASE, AND THERE CAN BE MORE AID. THEY GETS INTO GAZA SO THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO SEE THEIR FAMILIES AND TAKE CARE OF THE SICK. >>. AARON GILCHRIST: LIVE FOR US THERE, THANK YOU. >>>. THE MAN RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS BEING CALLED ONE OF THE WORLD'S WORST NATIONAL SECURITY BREACHES, PLEADING GUILTY TODAY TO SIX COUNTS UNDER THE ESPIONAGE ACT MESSAGES. INTERNATIONAL GUARDSMAN WHO IS ADMITTING TO LEAKING HUNDREDS OF CLASSIC -- DOCUMENTS ON DISCORD. THE PUNISHMENT: POTENTIALLY UP TO 17 YEARS IN PRISON WATCH >> THE DUTY TO DEFEND THE UNITED STATES. HE ABUSED HIS POSITION OF TRUST. HE DIDN'T CARE AT ALL ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES. >>. TEIXEIRA WAS APPARENTLY ABLE TO LEAK DOCUMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO SPY EFFORTS FOR MONTHS BEFORE HE WAS FINALLY ARRESTED. DO YOU REMEMBER THAT, THE REALLY DRAMATIC MOMENT WHEN HE SHARED THE LOCATION? NBC'S TOM WINTER HAS BEEN FOLLOWING ALL OF THIS FOR US. HE IS JOINING US NOW. IT KIND OF FELT LIKE A RECKONING MOMENT HERE RIGHT, A MOMENT FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO SAY THIS WOULD NOT BE TOLERATED. >>. REMEMBER THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S REPORT BY THE AIR FORCE LOOKING AT THIS ACTUALLY PUTTING DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS AGAINST 15 OF THEIR MEMBERS. SAYING: YOU GUYS KNOW HE WAS DOING THIS, THE DIVE. HE WAS GOING DOWN THE RABBIT, HOLE HUNDREDS OF SEARCHES FOR CLASSIFIED INFORMATION >> STUFF, HE SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR. >> HE WAS NOT IN A POSITION OF NEED TO KNOW. IT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF A SPY MOVIE, BUT FRANKLY IT IS. IT WAS NOT AT ALL RELATED TO THE TASK HE WAS ASSIGNED TO. THEN HE PUTS IT OUT THERE. YOU LOOK AT THAT BIG FBI PRESENCE WHEN THEY WERE SEARCHING THE HOME >> YOU KNOW THAT HAPPENED. IT WAS WALL-TO-WALL. >>. HE HAD HIS GUN SAFE TWO FEET FROM HIS BED. IF YOU LOOK IN HIS BEDROOM, IT LOOKS LIKE AN ARMY NEST WITH CAMOUFLAGE. HE'S GOT THE SCHEMATICS FOR CAR THAT HE WANTED TO USE AS AN ASSASSINATION CAR. THIS IS SOMEONE WHO HAS MADE A NUMBER OF THREATS BEFORE THE SERIOUS QUESTION AS TO WHY HE WAS ALLOWED TO THE WHITE HOUSE IN -- MILITARY IN THE FIRST POINT. IT IS A LONG LIST OF PEOPLE OVER THE PAST YEARS WHO HAVE BEEN INDIVIDUALS, WHO WERE PART OF THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, MAYBE THE CIA. THEY WERE INVOLVED WITH SHARING SOME OF THE CROWN JEWELS OF OUR INTELLIGENCE, LOOKING AT THE EVIDENCE SAYING 60 YEARS VERSUS 16 AND CHANGE- ANYBODY CAN DO THAT MATH. HE DECIDES TO GO FOR THE SKIMPY PLEA. IT RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF MATERIAL JUST ANYBODY HAS ACCESS TO. WHICH IS THE COMPUTER SYSTEM THAT HE USED TO GET THIS INFORMATION? IT IS CERTAINLY A DAY OF RECKONING. IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE IF WE SEE OTHER TYPES OF CASES LIKE THIS, AS A NEW GENERATION PEOPLE THAT ARE USED TO GOING INTO DEEP DIVES IN THEIR EARLY 20s, GAINING CONTINUED ACCESS TO THESE TYPES OF SYSTEMS >>. THANK YOU. WE'VE BEEN FOLLOWING THIS FOR A LONG TIME. WE APPRECIATE IT. >>> COMING UP, WE WILL SHOW YOU THE FIRST PICTURES OF KATE MIDDLETON THIS YEAR, AFTER SPECULATIONS ABOUT HER HEALTH, PLUS POTENTIAL RESEARCH WHAT OFFICIALS IN MALAYSIA ARE SAYING ABOUT THE INVESTIGATION IN THE PLANE THAT DISAPPEARED A. WE REACHED OUT FOR COMMENTS ON THESE PHOTOS AND THEY HAVE THE CLIENT TO COMMENT. SO FAR, LET'S GET YOU OVER TO THE FIVE THINGS OUR TEAM THINKS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT TONIGHT, SO MANY NEW DETAILS ABOUT A MURDER: HER HUSBAND FOUND HER BODY AT THEIR HOME IN PENNSYLVANIA. POLICE ARRESTING A 52-YEAR-OLD MAN IN CONNECTION WITH THE KILLING. NO WORD YET ON A POSSIBLE MOTIVE. THE SUSPECT HAS A HEARING IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS. >>> NUMBER TWO: THE FORMER CEO PLEADING GUILTY TO WO COUNTS OF PERJURY TODAY IN CONNECTION TO THE TESTIMONY HE GAVE ONE SOURCE TELLING NBC NEWS HE WAS NOT FIT TO ENTER INTO AN AGREEMENT THAT WOULD MAKE HIM TESTIFY IN A FUTURE TRIAL. JETBLUE AND SPIRIT ENDING THEIR MERGER. WEEKS AFTER A FEDERAL JUDGE BLOCKED THE DEAL. HE RULED THAT IT WOULD AFFECT CUSTOMERS. -- BOTH COMPANIES STILL BELIEVE IN THE DEAL, BUT THEY PROBABLY WOULDN'T MEET SOME OF THE REQUIREMENTS BEFORE THE DEADLINE IN JULY. THEY WILL HAVE TO PAY SPIRIT AND NEARLY $70 MILLION TERMINATION FEE. >>> THROW OUT POLYNESIAN SAUCE PACKETS. IF YOU BOUGHT IT IN THE LAST MONTH. IF YOU ENJOYED SOME CHICK-FIL-A AT THE STORE BETWEEN THE 14th AND THE 17th, HEADS UP. IF YOU GOT THE BIG BOTTLE AT THE STORE, YOU APPARENTLY DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT ALL. THAT THE NEWS RIGHT HERE ON NBC NEWS NOW >>> NUMBER FIVE: THE BRONCOS SAY THEY ARE RELEASING RUSSELL WILSON. HE RESPONDED TO THE ANNOUNCEMENT SAYING THAT BRONCOS COUNTRY, THANK YOU. I'M EXCITED FOR WHAT IS NEXT. THAT IS NOT EVEN. THE BIGGEST FOOTBALL HEADLINE. THE BIGGEST: THE ANNOUNCED RETIREMENT OF THE PHILADELPHIA EAGLES. TRAVIS KELCE -- JASON KELCE. HE WILL LEAVE AFTER HIS YEARS WITH THE EAGLES. >>>. WELCOME BACK TO POLITICS. WE ARE -- I DON'T KNOW- HALF A DAY AWAY. MAYBE POLLS OPEN AT 6:30 EASTERN. IT IS THE BIGGEST DAY OF THE CALENDAR, JUST IN TERMS OF SHEER NUMBERS. LOOK AT THE VOTERS IN 16 STATES. THIS YEAR. THIS COULD ALSO BE. MAY BE THE OFFICIAL OR UNOFFICIAL START TO THE GENERATIONAL -- GENERAL VOTE >>. Reporter. IT IS THE SINGLE BIGGEST ELECTION DAY ON THE PRIMARY CALENDAR: SUPER TUESDAY. MORE THAN 134 MILLION PEOPLE NEARLY HALF THE COUNTRY. IT CAN BE THE CLIMAX OF THE SEASON, WHEN THE COMPETITION THINS OUT LIKE IN 2020, WHEN MORE MODERATES BACKED OUT AND JOINED JOE BIDEN, LAUNCHING HIM TO THE NOMINATION. THE DRAMA LESS INTENSE THIS TIME. HE HAS NO SERIOUS CHALLENGER AND THERE ARE JUST TWO LEFT ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE: DONALD TRUMP AND NIKKI HALEY. >>. WE WILL KEEP GOING THROUGH. SUPER TUESDAY >>. Reporter. THAT PROMISE COMING JUST HOURS AFTER. SHE LOST HER HOME- STATE OF SOUTH KARELINA SHE'S LOST. SEVEN STATES THAT HAVE VOTED SO FAR. HER ONLY WIN: WASHINGTON DC, JUST 2000. PEOPLE VOTED HALEY WITH OUR RISTEN WALKER ABOUT HER EXPECTATIONS FOR TUESDAY >>. THAT HAS BEEN THE CASE IN EVERY STEP. CAN WE CONTINUE TO STAY COMPETITIVE WHEN 70% OF AMERICANS SAY THEY DON'T WANT DONALD TRUMP OR JOE BIDEN, YOU KEEP GOING? SO PEOPLE HAVE A CHOICE >>. Reporter. DONALD TRUMP IS 247 AND NIKKI HALEY 43.. SOME STATES JUST GETTING SOME VOTES WON'T HELP HER MUCH. FIVE OF THESE STATES AWARD CANDIDATES, ALL OF THEIR DELEGATE. FOR THOSE WHO WIN AT LEAST 50% OF THE VOTE, LIKE MR TRUMP HAS DONE IN EVERY STATE SO FAR. TYPICALLY, IT WON'T BE OVER AFTER TOMORROW NIGHT EVEN IF HE HAS A GANG BUSTER EVENING, HE STILL CAN'T HIT THE NUMBER THAT WILL CLINCH THE NOMINATION 1215.. THAT COULD COME AS EARLY AS NEXT WEEK PLUS. SHE IS TRYING TO STAY AT LEAST THROUGH TOMORROW NIGHT. YOU WILL SEE RIGHT ALONG WITH US TOMORROW NIGHT ON OUR SPECIAL SUPER TUESDAY COVERAGE, RIGHT HERE ON NBC NEWS. NOW I'M JOINED BY MY FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE, TOM LLAMAS. WE ARE ON UNTIL 10:00, THEN IT IS PICKING UP WITH LESTER AND SAVANNAH KRISTEN WALKER PICKING UP >>>. WHEN WE COME BACK. WHY THOUSANDS OF DOCTORS IN SOUTH KOREA MAY GET THEIR LICENSE IS TO SHARE. A MOMENT THAT BRIGHTENS YOUR DAY- EVERY DAY BEGINS --- DESERVES THE BEST START. >>>. WE ARE JUST LEARNING THAT HEAVILY ARMED GANGS IN HALEY ARE TRYING TO TAKE CONTROL. THE US EMBASSY IN HAITI IS TELLING ALL AMERICANS TO LEAVE ASAP THE HAITIAN GOVERNMENT, DECLARING A STATE OF EMERGENCY, WITH A NIGHTTIME CURFEW GOING IN PLACE. LATER ON, THEY STORMED THE COUNTRY'S BIGGEST PRISON THAT IS DRIVING SO MUCH OF THE CHAOS IN HAITI RIGHT. NOW THIS IS SOME OF THE AFTERMATH, WITH THOUSANDS OF INMATES ESCAPING THE PRISON. AT LEAST NINE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED, FOUR OF THEM POLICE OFFICERS. THIS PUSH TO TRY TO GET THE PRIME MINISTER TO RESIGN. I WANT TO BRING IN GUAD VENEGAS NOW. I KNOW THIS NEWS IS DEVELOPING AS WE SPEAK. DO YOU HAVE ANY NEWS ABOUT THE ATTACK? >>? Reporter. WE KNOW THE US AIRLINES ARE TEMPORARILY SUSPENDING ACCESS TO HAITI. WE DON'T HAVE MANY DETAILS. A LOT OF THE NEWS COMES FROM THE ASSOCIATED PRESS. BECAUSE OF THE SECURITY SITUATION, IT IS QUITE DIFFICULT TO GET INFORMATION OUT OF THE COUNTRY. WE KNOW THESE ATTACKS THAT HAPPENED OVER THE WEEKEND WERE ALLOWING SOME OF THE GANG MEMBERS IN THIS PRISON TO BREAK OUT. MOST LIKELY THEY WILL JOIN. SOME OF THESE GANGS THAT WE UNDERSTAND ARE NOW JOINING TOGETHER TO ATTEMPT TO TOPPLE THE GOVERNMENT. THE SECURITY SITUATION IN HAITI HAS BEEN WORSENING SINCE THE ASSASSINATION OF THEIR FORMER PRESIDENT. THE PRIME MINISTER BECAME THE INTERIM LEADER OF THE COUNTRY. THEY HAVEN'T HELD ELECTIONS SINCE AND THE GANGS ARE NOW VOWING TO TOPPLE THIS GOVERNMENT. ONE OF THE GANG LEADER SAYS HE WILL KEEP ATTACKING UNTIL THE PRIME MINISTER LEAVES OUT. ONE OF THE ISSUES WITH HAITI IS THE LACK OF SECURITY FORCES, THE NATIONAL POLICE. THERE HAS ABOUT 9000 OFFICERS, 9000 OFFICERS FOR THE COUNTRY OF 11 MILLION PEOPLE. THEY HAVE BEEN LOSING CONTROL EVEN. BEFORE THE VIOLENCE WE'VE SEEN OVER THE WEEKEND, HAITI HAD ABOUT 80% OF ITS CAPITOL CONTROLLED BY THE GANG. IT WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE CURRENT FORCES TO TAKE CONTROL >>. IS IT EVEN POSSIBLE GUAD? >>. Reporter. THEY WERE MEETING TO DISCUSS HOW THEY COME TO HAITI. THEY AGREED THAT KENYA WOULD KEEP THE FORCE, BUT THERE ARE ISSUES IN KENYA WITH ITS OWN GOVERNMENT BECAUSE OF THE LEGISLATION SOMEWHERE AGAINST SENDING THE TROOPS. THE PRIME MINISTER, WHO IS THE INTERIM LEADER, LEFT COUNTRY IN KENYA AND IS TRYING TO CONVINCE THEM TO SEND A PEACEKEEPING MISSION THAT WOULD HELP REGAIN CONTROL OF THE CAPITOL. THEY WOULD ALSO DO THIS WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE UNITED NATIONS AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM COUNTRIES LIKE THE UNITED STATES. THAT HAS BEEN THE SOLUTION THAT HAS BEEN PROPOSED. WE ARE STILL WAITING TO SEE IF KENYA APPROVES TO SEND THIS MISSION INTO HAITI. >>. GUAD VENEGAS, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >>>. NBC NEWS COVERS HUNDREDS OF OTHER INTERNATIONAL STORIES EVERY DAY, BECAUSE IT CAN BE TOUGH TO READ, WATCH OR LISTEN TO THE MALL --. HERE IS A SEGMENT. WE CALL THE GLOBAL STORMING OUT OF FRANCE. A LOT OF CELEBRATION. TODAY THEY VOTE TO MAKE ABORTION A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT. THEY ARE THE FIRST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD TO DO THIS. STRENGTHENING ABORTION RIGHTS IN FRANCE, 80% SUPPORTED. >>> SUSPENDING THE LICENSE OF DOCTORS WHO HAVE BEEN STRIKING FOR WEEKS. DOZENS OF HOSPITALS TODAY CONFIRMING THE ABSENCES. NEARLY 9000 MEDICAL INTERNS AND RESIDENTS WALKED OFF THEIR JOBS, PROTESTING A PUSH TO BOOST THE NUMBER OF MED STUDENTS. THEY SAY SCHOOLS CAN'T HANDLE THAT KIND OF INCREASE THE MORE DOCTORS WOULD. MAKE MEDICAL CARE MORE EXPENSIVE, THEY SAID IT MAY START LOOKING FOR MISSING. MALAYSIA AIRLINES -- AGAIN AFTER AN AMERICAN COMPANY PROPOSED A NEW SEARCH AT THE ALLEGED PRESSURE I -- CRASH SITE NOT LONG AFTER. TAKING ALL THE TRANSPORTATION MANAGER SAID HE LISTENED, HE TRIED TO GET THE GOVERNMENT TO FIND A NEW CONTRACT TO RESTART THE SEARCH. THAT IS WHEN WE ARE CERTAINLY WATCHING. >>> TO BEIJING IN A SURPRISE MOVE TODAY, FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MORE THAN 30 YEARS, THE COUNTRY'S PREMIER WILL NOT SPEAK WITH REPORTERS. THAT IS A BIG DEAL, BECAUSE THE ANNUAL NEWS CONFERENCE IS ONE OF THE VERY FEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR JOURNALIST TO BE ABLE TO QUESTION TOP CHINESE LEADERS. IT HAS DECLARED ITS COMMITMENT TO TRANSPARENCY AT THE SAME TO TRANSPARENCY AT THE SAME TIME. PRESIDENT XI JINPING -- JOSH LETTERMAN IS JOINING ME NOW. CHINA IS CONSIDERED PRESS TRANSPARENCY RIGHT. EVEN. NOW THE WHOLE ACCOUNT IS GONE >>. Reporter. THAT'S RIGHT. IT IS CERTAINLY SENDING THE SIGNAL HAILLE THAT CHINA'S TOP LEADERS DON'T WANT TO ANSWER TOUGH QUESTIONS FROM JOURNALISTS. THIS IS DATA BACK TO 1993.. IT WAS THE EVENT OF THE ANNUAL SUMMIT. THERE WERE OPPORTUNITIES TO ASK THE CHINESE PREMIER ABOUT THINGS LIKE HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS, ABOUT CHALLENGES WITH THE ECONOMY, WHICH MAY BE ONE OF THE REASONS THAT CHINA'S LEADERS DON'T WANT TO HAVE THIS CONFERENCE THIS YEAR AND IN THE COMING YEARS. IT IS BECAUSE OF THE CHINESE ECONOMY. IT REALLY HAS BEEN SUFFERING, AS OF LATE, A MASSIVE REAL ESTATE CRISIS. THIS IS AS WELL AS ECONOMIC GROWTH RATES THAT ARE REALLY SLOWING. THIS WILL AVERT THE NEED FOR THEM TO HAVE TO ANSWER REALLY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FINANCIAL INDICATORS OF COURSE. IT WOULD ALSO REALLY REFLECT THE FACT THAT PRESIDENT XI HAS CONSOLIDATED THIS POWER, THE NUMBER TWO ROLE IN THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT, IS NOT NEARLY AS POWERFUL AS IT USED TO BE. >>. THE OTHER PIECE OF THIS: THE WAY THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE WE TALKED TO OUR COLLEAGUE -- AS WELL- THE IDEA OF SHIFTING SOME PERSPECTIVE ON CHINESE MEDIA, THE IDEA THAT THEY WERE REGULATING THE DISCUSSION THERE. HOW DO YOU SEE THAT FITTING INTO THE BIGGER PICTURE? JOSH, I THINK IT IS VERY DIFFERENT FOR AMERICAN VIEWERS. THEY CAN LARGELY GET ON SOCIAL. THEY CAN LARGELY GET ON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS AND SHARE THIS >>. Reporter. THAT'S RIGHT. WE ARE NOT USED TO DOING A SEARCH ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK OR ANYTHING ELSE AND HAVING IT SIMPLY NOT APPEAR BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T WANT IT TO. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED TODAY ON CHINESE SOCIAL MEDIA, WHEN PEOPLE WERE SEARCHING FOR THE PHRASING OF THE STATEMENT THAT WAS PUT OUT AND AFTER THE NEWS CONFERENCE WOULD NOT TAKE PLACE, IT SIMPLY BROUGHT UP AN ERROR MESSAGE. IT IS A LITTLE BIT IRONIC, GIVEN THAT THE CONFERENCE IN THE PAST HAD BEEN REALLY ONE OF THE EMBLEMS OF CHINA'S CLAIM THAT IT WAS MOVING TOWARD A MORE DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM AND IT WANTS TO BE OPEN TO THE REST OF THE WORLD, ESPECIALLY TO BUSINESS AND FOREIGN INVESTMENT. YET, THEY ARE SHUTTING DOWN THIS CONFERENCE. THEY DIDN'T WANT PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT IT ON SOCIAL MEDIA. WE STILL SEE THE VERY CLEAR RESISTANCE THAT THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT HAS ESPECIALLY UNDER PRESIDENT XI JINPING >>. JOSH LETTERMAN, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR UNPACKING ALL OF THAT FOR US. SUPER INTERESTING >>>. COMING UP ON THE SHOW, LeBRON, JAMES AND DRAKE BETTING BIG ON THE PGA TOUR â™ª â™ª >>>. LeBRON AND DRAKE ARE USING THEIR MARKETING POWER AND, BY THE WAY, THEIR POWERFUL MONEY TO JOIN A BIG PUSH TO UP THE PGA TOUR AND OFF THE PGA TOUR AND OFF COMPETITION, FROM LIVE GOLF- LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS- TO THE BIGGEST NAMES IN GOLF. YOU MAY NOT SEE STARS LIKE -- JOHNSON, JOHN RUM- YOU CAN SEE THERE. HE IS JOINING US NOW. LeBRON, JAMES AND DRAKE- THEY ARE STRATEGIC INVESTORS. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? IT MEANS MONEY MARKETING AND TRYING TO COMBAT WHAT LIV IS DOING HERE >>. IT IS JUST BRINGING THE POWER OF THEIR POPULARITY TO IT. AS WELL, IT IS A BIG MATCH AS TO WHO CAN BRING IN THE MOST AMOUNT OF MONEY. BRING IN THE BIG NAMES IN THE GOLFING WART -- WORLD ITSELF. YOU HAVE THE MONEY COMING IN FROM DRAKE AND LeBRON. THE IDEA HERE IS TO ALSO USE THEIR NAMES TO BRING POPULARITY TO THE PGA TOUR. AS WELL, LeBRON HAS THE CONNECTEDNESS TO THE GLOBAL SPORTS WORLD AND DRAKE, OBVIOUSLY ICONIC, MY, MY MONEY, MONEY ON MY MIND AND HE IS COURTSIDE ON THE SIDE OF THE TORONTO RAPTORS GAME >>. SO WHAT DOES IT MEAN BY THE BIG MERGER NEWS? >> YOU HAVE THE PENDING MERGER RIGHT. YOU DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW IT WILL WORK OUT. THERE IS A GAME PLAN AND AGREEMENT BETWEEN PTA AND LIV SUMMERS. THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DONE BY DECEMBER 31st. THIS IS VERY INTERESTING, BECAUSE YOU ARE LOOKING AT THIS PENDING MERGER. THEY HAVE TO PREPARE. IF THAT HAPPENS, HOW WILL YOU FIND YOURSELF RIGHT? THAT'S WHY THEY GOT THE MONEY TO HAVE THE COMMITMENT FROM THE SPORTS GROUP AND PART OF THAT FUND ALSO THE CELEBRITY OF THESE TWO MASSIVE ICONS AS WELL >>. THAT IS SAYING THE IDEA THAT BEING DRAWN LeBRON AND DRAKE WITH THIS INVESTMENT >>. YES, THAT WILL BE VERY IMPORTANT. IF THE MERGER DOESN'T GO THROUGH, I GUESS THEY STILL HAVE LeBRON AND DRAKE SHOWING UP AT THE EVENTS AT THE END OF THE DAY, MAYBE HAVING THE PLANNING, IF YOU WILL, IN CASE THAT DOESN'T END UP HAPPENING >>. THANKS FOR BEING HERE. >>> STILL TO COME ANOTHER POTENTIAL GAME CHANGER, THIS ONE FOR THE WORLD OF COLLEGE SPORTS. HOW A UNION PUSH COULD MAYBE BE THE END OF THE NCAA AS WE KNOW >>. AND YOUR WALLET >>. NBC NEWS DAILY WEEKDAYS, FROM 12:00 TO 4:00 PM EASTERN ON NBC NEWS NOW. EASTERN ON NBC NEWS NOW. >>>. IN-DEPTH REPORTING ON WHAT WE'VE BEEN WATCHING, WITH MARCH MADNESS COMING UP PRETTY QUICKLY. WE COULD SEE AN ELECTION TOMORROW. THAT COULD CHANGE COLLEGE SPORTS FOREVER. NO, NOT SUPER TUESDAY, THIS ONE INSIDE NEW HAMPSHIRE THEY WILL VOTE TO POTENTIALLY MAYBE FORM THE FIRST EVER UNION. MAYBE FORM THE FIRST EVER UNION IN COLLEGE SPORTS. RESULTS WILL STAY HIDDEN, BUT IT IS A BIG SHIFT. IT COULD POTENTIALLY END THE NCAA AS WE KNOW IT. HERE IS LAURA BARRETT WITH MOORE >>. Reporter KATE AND --. EVERY DAY IS WORK AND SCHOOL, SCHOOL AND WORK. THE WORK THEY DO DOESN'T COME WITH THE PAYCHECK. WHY? BECAUSE THEY ARE ON THE MEN'S BASKETBALL TEAM >>. EVEN THOUGH, WE ARE WORKING FULL-TIME JOBS, BASICALLY BEING ON THE TEAM >>. THE ONLY WAY COLLEGE ATHLETES CAN GET MONEY THROUGH PLAYING IS CALLED -- THINGS LIKE AUTOGRAPHS, APPEARANCES- JUST NOT DIRECTLY, FOR AT THEY DO ON THE FIELD SOME LIKE -- CAN RACK UP BIG BUCKS. THOSE OPPORTUNITIES ON EXIST FOR EVERY ATHLETE. THAT IS WHY THEY DECIDED TO FORM A UNION TO COMPENSATE LOOK OTHER STUDENT EMPLOYEES WITH HOURLY WAGES SIMILAR TO OTHER WAGES ON CAMPUS OR SCHOLARSHIPS. BOTH PLAYERS HAVE HAD TO TAKE ON WHAT ARE ESSENTIALLY THIRD JOBS. HASKINS HAS EXPERIENCE WITH UNIONS >>. HOW INFLUENTIAL THEIR VOICES BECAME ONCE THEY ACTUALLY BECAME A UNION >>. ATHLETES HAVE TRIED THIS BEFORE, BEFORE WHEN THEY TRY TO CREATE A LABOR UNION >>. THE BOARD FOR THE NORTHWEST IS BEING DECADES LATER, A SHIFT. NOW THEY ARE BACKING THEIR BID RULING THAT THE BASKETBALL TEAMS PERFORMS WORK IN EXCHANGE FOR COMPENSATION IN THE FORM OF BEER AND TICKETS. IVY LEAGUE ATHLETES DON'T GET ACCESS. DARTMOUTH IS APPEALING THE RULING THEY ARE RULING. IT IS NOT APPROPRIATE IN THIS INSTANCE. THE COST OF THE PROGRAM FAR EXCEEDS ANY REVENUE FOR THE PROGRAM. HASKINS AND MARTEL ALREADY HAVE THEIR SIGHTS SET ON SOMETHING BIGGER, OVERTURNING THE WHOLE SYSTEM >>. IT CHALLENGES THE TERM THAT WE SEE SO OFTEN. YOU GUYS BEING STUDENT ATHLETES, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT? DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT? >> NO, IT IS USED TO KEEPING THE ATHLETES -- EMPATHIZING WITH THE ATHLETE PART OF IT, THE FACT THAT THEY ACTUALLY DO WORK FOR THE COLLEGE >>. MICHAEL McCANN SAYS THESE RULINGS CAN PUT THE ENTIRE NCAA ON NOTICE. MAKE IT AS A GAME CHANGER FOR COLLEGE SPORTS. THERE WOULD BE A FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT FROM MODEL WHEREBY RULE. THESE SCHOOLS CANNOT PAY THE ATHLETE AND THAT MAKES THEM AMATEURS. COLLEGE PLAYERS HAVE A BIG ROLE IN TERMS OF GENERATING REVENUE, GENERATING FUNDRAISING, GENERATING ADMISSION SCHOOLS, MIGHT THINK, FOR SOME OF THESE NUMBERS >>. Reporter. IT HAS A KEY FACTOR WORKING IN ITS FAVOR: PUBLIC SCHOOLS, LIKE ALABAMA OHIO STATE. THEY AREN'T COVERED. THERE IS NO SIGN THAT ATHLETES AT THOSE SCHOOLS COULD FORM UNIONS. YET MORE THAN A THIRD OF THE SCHOOLS ARE PRIVATE, LEAVING THE MORE OPEN TO TAKE THAT STEP, THEY ARE NOW FOCUSING ON BRINGING TOGETHER THE WHOLE IVY LEAGUE UNDER ONE ROOF >>. WE ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES, IT IS EVERYBODY THEY FEEL LIKE WE ARE BEING USED IN THE IVY LEAGUE. WE WANT TO CHANGE THAT. >>. LAURA IS JOINING US THERE. IT IS SUPER INTERESTING. THERE IS ALSO A BIT OF A POLITICAL TIE IN EXPLAIN THAT >>. THERE IS ALWAYS A POLITICAL TIE IN RIGHT HAILLE BAKER, WHO WAS THE REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR, SAYING SHE WAS USED TO NAVIGATING BIG CHANGES IN THE INSTITUTION. NAVIGATING CHANGE, NAVIGATING CHANGE. HE WAS THAT KIND OF GOVERNOR. IN A VERY LIBERAL MASSACHUSETTS, THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES ACTUALLY CHOOSES THE GENERAL COUNSEL. SO WE KNOW THAT JOE BIDEN IS VERY -- BUT THIS COULD DRAG ON UNTIL WELL PAST NOVEMBER AND ELECTION SEASON. FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S HASN'T TAKEN A STANCE ON THIS ISSUE. THAT IT COULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE, DEPENDING ON WHAT WE SEE IN NOVEMBER. >>. MAURA BARRETT, THANK YOU FOR BRINGING US THAT STORY. THAT DOES IT FOR US THIS HOUR: MORE COVERAGE PICKING UP RIGHT.",[52]

TODAY IS SUPER TUESDAY, WITH VOTING TAKING PLACE IN MORE THAN A DOZEN STATES, AND THAT MEANS MORE THAN ONE THIRD OF ALL DELEGATES WILL BE UP FOR GRABS TODAY. THE REPUBLICAN FRONT RUNNER, DONALD TRUMP, WILL MOVE CLOSER TO BECOMING HIS PARTY'S NOMINE. HIS CHALLENGER, NIKKI HALEY, IS STAYING IN THE RACE EVEN THOUGH. SHE HAS JUST WON ONE CONTEST SO FAR. SHE CAMPAIGNED IN TEXAS YESTERDAY, TELLING VOTERS THAT CASTING A BALLOT IS CRUCIAL. >> COURAGE FOR ME TO RUN AND COURAGE FOR EVERYONE OF YOU TO KNOW. DON'T COMPLAIN ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS IN A GENERAL ELECTION IF YOU DON'T PLAY IN THIS PRIMARY IT MATTERS >>. WE DO HAVE THE RESULTS OF THE FINAL CONTEST. AHEAD OF SUPER TUESDAY, DONALD TRUMP HAS WON THE NORTH DAKOTA REPUBLICAN CAUCUSES INCHING CLOSER TO THE NOMINATION AND BY WINNING MORE THAN 60% OF THE VOTE, TRUMP IS SET TO WIN ALL 29 OF THE STATE'S DELEGATES. >>. WE HAVE TEAM COVERAGE THIS MORNING OF SUPER TUESDAY AT POLLING LOCATIONS IN VIRGINIA AND MASSACHUSETTS. LET'S BEGIN- AND MASSACHUSETTS LET'S BEGIN- WITH MARK MURRAY. TODAY IS THE BIGGEST SINGLE VOTING DAY IN THE PRIMARY SEASON. NEARLY 900 DELEGATES ARE UP FOR GRABS. DELEGATES ARE UP FOR GRABS. WHAT IS AT STAKE HERE TODAY, ESPECIALLY AS HALEY'S CAMPAIGN IS LOOKING FOR ANY KIND OF MOMENTUM AFTER WINNING DC OVER THE WEEKEND. >> THE DELEGATE MATH AND THE REPUBLICAN RACE. 855 DELEGATES ARE UP FOR GRABS AND TONIGHT'S CONTEST AND ON DONALD TRUMP'S NIGHT HE MAY END UP GETTING 800 OUT OF 865 DUE TO MANY OF THE ALLOCATION RULES INEFFECTUALLY WINNER TAKE ALL. IF YOU GET 60% OR MORE FROM THE CONTEST, NIKKI HALEY'S BEST NIGHT, SHE MIGHT BE ABLE TO HOLD DONALD TRUMP TO FEWER THAN 700 DELEGATES, AND THAT JUST KIND OF SHOWS YOU THE SCAPE THAT. EVEN. IF SHE DOES SUPER WELL TONIGHT AND IT EXCEEDS EXPECTATIONS, SHE WILL TRAIL DONALD TRUMP SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE DELEGATE RACE FOR THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION >>. SO PRESIDENT TRUMP IS THE HEAVY FAVORITE TO WIN TODAY. WHAT ARE SOME OF THE RESULTS? YOU >>. >>. MY BASELINE IS ABOUT THE NATIONAL POLLS THAT WE HAVE SEEN IN THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CONTEST AFTER THE SOUTH CAROLINA PRIMARY, WHERE DONALD TRUMP LEADS BY ABOUT 80 POINTS IN AN 80 TO 20 MARGIN. WE WILL SEE IF THAT HOLDS UP. WE WILL SEE IF THAT HOLDS UP TONIGHT. THERE ARE SOME OPEN CATEGORIES THAT ALLOW INDEPENDENTS TO PARTICIPATE. I WILL BE LOOKING FOR SOME STATES, LIKE VIRGINIA OR MASSACHUSETTS, WHERE NIKKI HALEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO OVER PERFORM AND GIVE DONALD TRUMP A CLOSER CONTEST. BUT OVERALL, I THINK THE EXPECTATION IS THAT DONALD TRUMP WILL PROBABLY END UP EMERGING THE AREAS IN ALL OF THE CONTESTS >>. WITH EVERY PASSING DAY, IT LOOKS MORE AND MORE LIKELY THAT WE WILL SEE THIS REMATCH, THIS FALL. RECENT POLLS SHOW MR TRUMP LEADING PRESIDENT BIDEN. SOME OF THOSE POLLS ARE IN THE MARGIN OF ERROR. WILL EITHER CANDIDATE BECOME THE PRESUMPTIVE NOMINEE TONIGHT >>. TECHNICALLY, WE ARE NOT GOING TO GET TO THAT PRESUMPTIVE NOMINEE STAGE, MOST LIKELY UNTIL LATER THIS MONTH. THE MAGIC NUMBER OF THE REPUBLICAN RACE IS 1215 DELEGATES, AND EVEN IF DONALD TRUMP DOES SUPER WELL AND GETS ALMOST ALL OF THE DELEGATES, HE IS NOT GOING TO COME CLOSE TO THAT NUMBER. HE WILL IN THE WEEKS AHEAD HOWEVER. EFFECTIVELY, WE HAVE BEEN IN THIS STAGE HEADING TOWARD THE INEVITABLE DONALD TRUMP VERSUS JOE BIDEN SHOWDOWN, AND WE GET TO THAT STAGE LATER THIS MONTH. >>>. FOR A PERSPECTIVE FROM VOTERS, LET'S BRING IN NBC NEWS POLITICAL REPORTER FROM MASSACHUSETTS. VIRGINIA HAS THIS OPEN PRIMARY AND THAT MEANS VOTERS DON'T HAVE TO BE REGISTERED AS A REPUBLICAN TO VOTE IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY. IS THAT EXPECTED TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE RESULTS THERE >>? GOOD MORNING. VOTERS ARE VOTING IN THE COMMONWEALTH. HOLES HAVE BEEN OPEN FOR ABOUT AN HOUR, AND VOTERS HERE IN VIRGINIA TEND TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO SURPRISE THE WITH THEIR VOTE. THINK BACK TO 2021, WHEN YOUNGKIN ENDED UP IN THE GOVERNORSHIP. HERE IN VIRGINIA, WE ARE LOOKING AT TWO PLACES. FIRST, AMONG INDEPENDENTS. WHERE DID THE SWING VOTERS? WHERE DO THESE INDEPENDENTS END UP? BECAUSE IT IS AN OPEN PRIMARY. THEY WALK INTO THE BUILDING BEHIND ME AND THEY CHOOSE REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT, AND THEY CAN BE ANY PARTY THEY WANT. THEY CAN PICK THEIR CANDIDATE. THE OTHER IS GOING TO BE AMONG DEMOCRATS. DEMOCRATS DON'T HAVE TO VOTE FOR JOE BIDEN TONIGHT. THEY CAN VOTE FOR NIKKI HALEY OR DONALD TRUMP OR A WRITE-IN CANDIDATE AS WELL >>. GARY, YOU ARE IN A SPOT WHERE FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS NOT DONE PARTICULARLY WELL OVER THE YEARS. WHAT ARE YOU HEARING FROM VOTERS TODAY? >>. WE ARE LITTLE BIT NORTH OF THE STATE CAPITOL OF RICHMOND HERE IN VIRGINIA, AND WE HAVE HEARD FROM ALL THREE SIDES OF THE TICKET. WE HAVE HEARD FROM NIKKI HALEY VOTERS, DONALD TRUMP VOTERS AND FROM JOE BIDEN VOTERS AS WELL. WHAT YOU'RE HEARING LINES UP. NIKKI HALEY VOTERS SAY THEY WANT TO RETURN TO NORMAL AND GOVERNORSHIP AND HOW IT WORKS THERE. DONALD TRUMP VOTERS TELL ME THEY DON'T BELIEVE THE ELECTION IN 2020 WAS ACCURATE OR FAIR, AND THEY WANT TO SEE IT BECOME FAIR. AND THEY WANT TO SEE THE ECONOMY GET BETTER. JOE BIDEN'S VOTERS SAY THEY LIKE WHAT THEY HAVE SEEN SO FAR AND THEY WANT TO SEE MORE. >>. YOU WERE ON THE PRODUCING TEAM OF THE SHOW AND NOW YOU ARE ON THE SHOW. 63% OF VOTERS ARE UNENROLLED AND CAN VOTE IN EITHER PRIMARY. THIS GROUP IS A HUGE TARGET FOR NIKKI HALEY AND POTENTIALLY A HUGE OPPORTUNITY FOR HER. WHAT ARE YOU HEARING ON THE GROUND FROM HER? >>. Reporter. 63% IS KEY FOR NIKKI HALEY, BECAUSE HERE IN MASSACHUSETTS, ONLY APPROXIMATELY 8% ARE REGISTERED REPUBLICANS. THE HALEY TEAM IS LOOKING AT THAT. THE DOSE. 63% AND HOPING PEOPLE WILL VOTE IN THE PRIMARY CYCLE, WHICH IS THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY. THERE IS A CAVEAT. IF YOU ARE, THERE IS A CAVEAT. IF YOU ARE UNENROLLED IN MASSACHUSETTS, YOU ARE NOT NECESSARILY GOING TO BE VOTING IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY, AS I HAVE BEEN SPEAKING TO PEOPLE IN THE STATE. A LOT OF THEM TELL ME THEY WILL EITHER BE VOTING FOR TRUMP OR JOE BIDEN, AND THAT SHOWS THE LEVEL OF ADVOCACY THAT VOTERS HAVE TOWARD WHAT THEY SEE AS THE INEVITABLE WHICH IS TRUMP VERSUS BIDEN REMATCH. ONE THING I WILL POINT OUT IS THAT THE NIKKI HALEY BORDERS -- VOTERS I HAVE BEEN SPEAKING TO- DO NOT WANT TO SEE A TRUMP VERSUS BIDEN REMATCH, AND TELL ME IF IT COMES TO IT THEY WILL DO ONE OF THREE THINGS: DO THE TOP OF THE TICKET LINK RIGHT IN HALEY'S NAME OR VOTE FOR A THIRD PARTY. >>. WHAT SEEMS TO BE ON VOTERS MINDS WHEN IT COMES TO ISSUES AS THEY LOOK AHEAD TO THE NOVEMBER BALLOT >>. Reporter. WHEN I TALKED TO VOTERS IN MASSACHUSETTS- REPUBLICAN VOTERS- THE NUMBER 1 ISSUE- I AM HEARING TIME AND TIME AGAIN- IS IMMIGRATION. YOU MIGHT BE THINKING THAT MASSACHUSETTS IS PRETTY FAR FROM THE SOUTHERN BORDER, AND THAT IS TRUE GEOGRAPHICALLY. HOWEVER, MASSACHUSETTS IS HOME TO A NUMBER OF SANCTUARY CITIE MIGRANTS. DIRECTLY IMPACT MASSACHUSETTS STATE: 63% THAT MAY BE CHOOSING TO VOTE IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY. IT IS A REFERENDUM AGAINST THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION IMMIGRATION POLICY >>. THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH. AND WE WILL HAVE COVERAGE OF SUPER TUESDAY ON NBC NEWS NOW, AND OUR EXTENT OF LIVE COVERAGE GETS UNDERWAY SOON. >>>. NOW TO A SUPREME COURT RULING THAT IS HAVING A MAJOR IMPACT ON SUPER TUESDAY, SPECIFICALLY COLORADO. THE SUPREME COURT STATE OBJECTED TO COLORADO -- THAT REVERSES THE COLORADO SUPREME COURT RULING WHICH DETERMINED THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP COULD NOT SERVE AS PRESIDENT AGAIN BECAUSE HE WAS PART OF AN INSURRECTION. >>. THIS IS A VICTORY FOR NOT ONLY COLORADO BUT TWO OTHER STATES THAT HAVE MOVED TO STRIKE HIM FROM THE BALLOT. >>. THE US SUPREME COURT DEALING A FINAL BLOW TO STATES TRYING TO BAN FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP FROM THE BALLOT IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION. THE JUSTICES LEAVING IT UP TO VOTERS TO DECIDE IF THE FORMER PRESIDENT RETURNS TO THE WHITE HOUSE. MR TRUMP IS PRAISING THE RULING. >>. THE VOTERS CAN TAKE SOMEONE OUT OF THE RACE VERY QUICKLY, BUT THE COURT SHOULD NOT BE DOING THAT >>. Reporter. FINDING MR TRUMP IS INELIGIBLE UNDER SECTION 3 OF THE 14th AMENDMENT, A LARGELY UNTESTED CLAUSE OF THE CONSTITUTION PASSED AFTER THE CIVIL WAR, DISQUALIFYING THOSE WHO ENGAGE IN INSURRECTION FROM HOLDING PUBLIC OFFICE AGAIN AND ELECTION OFFICIAL NAMED. AND A JUDGE IN ILLINOIS LATER DOING THE SAME, BANNING THE REPUBLICAN FRONT RUNNER FROM RUNNING ON THE BALLOT. THE RULING FROM THE HIGH COURT NOW ENDING ALL SIMILAR EFFORTS TO DISQUALIFY MR TRUMP FROM THE BALLOT. >>. WHILE MOST STATES WERE THRILLED, THERE WERE SOME THAT THRILLED, THERE WERE SOME THAT WERE NOT >>. Reporter. THE JUSTICES, SING THAT PATCHWORK OF DIFFERENT RULING ACROSS THE COUNTRY, CANNOT STAND FINDING. RESPONSIBILITY FOR ENFORCING SECTION 3 AGAINST FEDERAL OFFICEHOLDERS REST WITH CONGRESS AND NOT THE STATE. AT THE SAME TIME, THE THREE LIBERAL JUSTICES ACCUSING THEIR CONSERVATIVE COLLEAGUES OF GOING TOO FAR BY RULING CONGRESS MUST ENACT NEW LEGISLATION IN ORDER TO BAN A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE. WRITING THIS WOMAN WILL MAKE IT HARDER TO BAR. INSURRECTION IS FROM BECOMING PRESIDENT. CAUTIONING THIS COURT SHOULD TURN THE NATIONAL TEMPERATURE DOWN, NOT UP. >>. THE DECISION WITH THE COURTS MOST IMPORTANT RULING CONCERNING A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. THAT IS WHEN THE COURT RULED IN BUSH'S FAVOR, IN BUSH VERSUS GORE, WHICH VIOLATED THE EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE BY USING DIFFERENT STANDARDS DURING THE BALLOT RECOUNT, GIVING BUSH FLORIDA'S ELECTORAL VOTE FOR PRESIDENT. >>>. THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT IS TEMPORARILY BLOCKING A CONTROVERSIAL IMMIGRATION LAW THAT WAS SENT TO TAKE PLACE IN TEXAS. THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION SENT TO STOP THE LAW, KNOWN AS AS THE -- S B 4.. TEXAS ARGUED THE LAW WAS LEGAL UNDER THE STATE CLAUSE AND ALSO NEEDED BECAUSE THE LEADERSHIP BELIEVES IT IS EFFECTIVELY BATTLING AN INVASION AT THE PUBLIC ORDER. THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION ARGUES THAT A SURGE OF UNAUTHORIZED IMMIGRATION IS NOT THE SAME AS AN INVASION. THE LAW IS SET TO TAKE LACE ON MARCH 10th, BUT THE RULING UNTIL MARCH 13th GIVEN ALL NINE JUSTICES MORE TIME TO DETERMINE WHAT NEXT STEPS TO TAKE. >>>. THE LATEST ROUND OF CEASE- FIRE TALKS, AIMED AT HALTING THE WAR IN GAZA AND RELEASING HOSTAGES, HAS ENDED WITHOUT A BREAK THROUGH. >>. THE NEGOTIATIONS IN CAIRO INVOLVES HAMAS AND INTERNATIONAL MEDIATORS BUT NO ISRAELI DELEGATION ATTENDED. THE UNITED STATES AND OTHERS ARE PUSHING TO SECURE A DEAL BEFORE RAMADAN STARTS THIS WEEKEND. >>. MATT BRADLEY JOINS US NOW. WE, UNDERSTAND, THE TALKS HAVE BROKEN UP AND THERE IS NO DEAL. YET WHAT WERE THE MAJOR STICKING POINTS? >>. Reporter, A NEW DEAL, AND I THINK THAT EVERYONE IS PROBABLY DISAPPOINTED, BUT PROBABLY NOT SURPRISED, BECAUSE THIS IS CERTAINLY NOT THE FIRST FALSE START SINCE THE LAST ROUND OF NEGOTIATIONS TO RELEASE HOSTAGES AND PRISONERS EVER SINCE NOVEMBER, WHEN WE SAW A WEEKLONG BUZZ OF PRISONERS RELEASED. A LOT OF THOSE YOU ARE ASKING ABOUT ARE THE SAME ONES THAT HAVE RESISTED IN THE PAST MONTHS OF NEGOTIATION. >>. ISRAEL DID NOT ATTEND AND REASON WHY. ISRAEL SAYS THEY NEED A DEMAND ANSWERED FROM HAMAS, A SPECIFIC DEMAND WHICH IS ACTUALLY SORT OF NEW SAYING. THEY WANT A LIST OF ALL OF THE HOSPITAL JUST THAT ARE STILL ALIVE. THEY WANT TO KNOW WHO THEY ARE NEGOTIATING FOR AND WHETHER OR NOT THE PEOPLE ARE ALIVE OR DEAD. THERE ARE CURRENTLY 100 HOSTAGES, INCLUDING SIX AMERICANS, SO THIS IS A BIG PART OF THE NEGOTIATION. A LOT OF THE HOSTAGES HAVE BEEN KILLED. 1/5 HAVE BEEN KILLED, AND IT IS NOT CLEAR ENTIRELY WHY SOME HAVE SUCCUMBED TO THEIR WOUNDS. THEY SUSTAINED ON OCTOBER 7th AND OTHERS WERE LIKELY KILLED IN ISRAELI ATTACKS ON THE GAZA STRIP- THE SAME FORCE THAT HAS KILLED MORE THAN 30,000 PEOPLE, ACCORDING TO THE GAZA MINISTRY OF HEALTH. THESE ISSUES ARE STILL PERSISTENT BECAUSE BOTH SIDES ARE STILL SO FAR APART. HAMAS WANTS A RELEASE OF ALL PRISONERS AND A CEASE-FIRE. SOMETHING THAT IS REAL, HAS SAID, IS A NONSTARTER GAZA SAYING: THOSE DEMANDS ARE LUDICROUS >>. THE IMAGES SHOW THE CONDITIONS ARE JUST DETERIORATING DAY BY DAY. THE UNITED STATES AGENCY AT THE FOREFRONT OF RELEASE WORK IN GAZA AND THE STARVATION THAT IS STARTING TO HAPPEN. THERE IS CONTROVERSY. THERE IS CONTROVERSY AFTER ISRAEL ACCUSED THEM OF OPERATIVES FROM HAMAS AND OTHER TERRORIST GROUPS. THE UN SAYS IT IS WAITING TO RECEIVE EVIDENCE ON THE ALLEGATIONS. BUT YESTERDAY WE HEARD FROM THE CHIEF ABOUT ALL OF THIS >>. HE WAS BASICALLY COMPLAINING AND SAYING THE SAME THINGS HE HAS BEEN SAYING FOR THE LAST FEW MONTHS. WITHOUT THIS FUNDING, THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE WILL SUFFER, EVEN THOUGH THIS ORGANIZATION HAS ANNOUNCED THEY WILL COMPLY WITH THE ISRAELI INVESTIGATION INTO HAMAS' ROLE, INTO THE ORGANIZATION. AT THE SAME TIME, DON'T LET THE ENTIRE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE SUFFER BECAUSE OF THIS ISSUE, AS YOU MENTIONED. WE HEARD FROM THE HEAD, AND HERE IS WHAT HE HAD TO SAY: >> WITHOUT ADDITIONAL FUNDING, WE WILL BE ON CHOPPY TERRITORY. WITH SERIOUS INDICATIONS FOR, WITH SERIOUS INDICATIONS FOR GLOBAL PEACE, THE FIT OF THE AGENCY IN THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WOULD DEPEND ON IT HANGING IN THE BALANCE, FACING THE DELIBERATE AND CONSERVATIVE TO UNDERMINE ITS OPERATIONS AND ULTIMATELY END THEM >>. ALL OF THIS IS COUNTING DOWN TO ISRAEL'S ASSAULT ON THE SOUTHERNMOST TOWN AND CITY IN THE GAZA STRIP. OTHER AGENCIES AND OTHER COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS HAVE ALL WARNED THAT IF THIS ATTACK, WHERE THE FINAL REMNANTS OF HAMAS ARE LIVING, IT COULD CREATE WHAT THEY ARE SAYING IS A HUMANITARIAN CATASTROPHE. IN THAT CASE, FUNDING WILL BE NEEDED MORE THAN EVER >>>. YESTERDAY WE REPORTED ON VICE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH. TODAY HAS SOME EXCLUSIVE REPORTING ON HOW OFFICIALS HAVE ACTUALLY WATERED DOWN PARTS OF THAT SPEECH WHICH WERE ESPECIALLY CRITICAL OF ISRAEL. WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THAT? >>. IT WAS INTERESTING BECAUSE THIS WAS DONE WITH THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL AND FROM OUR OWN REPORTING, FROM MY COLLEAGUES IN WASHINGTON SAYING THIS WASN'T A SUBSTANTIVE SHIFT, THAT THIS BILL WAS IMPOSED UPON KAMALA HARRIS'S SPEECH. THERE WAS NO POLICY CHANGE, NOTHING. THAT YOU ARE GOING TO ANNOUNCE ABOUT AMERICAN POSTURE TOWARD ISRAEL, THAT THEY NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL WALKED BACK. BUT IT DOES GO TO SHOW THAT KAMALA HARRIS HAD A MORE FORCEFUL TONE IN MIND AGAINST ISRAEL AND THAT THE UNITED STATES, WHICH HAS BEEN FALLING OUT WITH BENJAMIN NETANYAHU OVER THE LAST MONTHS, DECIDED TO BRING THAT IN JUST A LITTLE BIT. WHETHER OR NOT, THE THINKING IS TO KEEP ISRAEL ON SIDE. THIS IS PART OF A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WASHINGTON AND ISRAEL AND ONE THAT WE WILL SEE CONTINUE TO EVOLVE OVER THE COMING MONTHS >>>. LET'S GET TO THE WEATHER. THERE IS A SOGGY WEEK IN STORE. THERE IS A SOGGY WEEK IN STORE FOR THE COAST >>. WE'VE GOT SO RAIN IN THE FORECAST AND THIS IS WHAT WE WILL BE WATCHING OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. YOUR SATELLITE AND RADAR SHOWING A COUPLE OF SPOTS. ONE IN THE NORTHEAST, WASHINGTON DC- TO NEW YORK. A LITTLE SOGGY THIS MORNING. RAIN WORKING ACROSS PARTS OF THE MIDWEST, WORKING EAST AS THE DAY GOES ON DOWN ALONG THE GULF COAST AND PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHERN PLAINS, MOORE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS THAT WE ARE TRACKING THROUGH THE DAY TODAY. PARTS OF THE NORTHEAST, WASHINGTON, PHILADELPHIA AND NEW YORK WILL BE A LITTLE WET THIS MORNING. HE WILL NEED MORE TIME FOR YOUR MORNING COMMUTE. THAT IS BRINGING THE RAIN ACROSS THAT REGION THIS MORNING, AS WE LOOK OFF TO THE AREAS OF THE MIDWEST AND PARTS OF THE SOUTH, WE HAVE A COLD FRONT THAT IS LEAVING US WITH UNSETTLED WEATHER. THIS WILL MOVE TO THE EAST AS WE GO THROUGH THE DAY. TODAY, THE COASTAL LOW WILL BE OUT OF HERE BUT LOOK AT THIS BIG PUSH OF MOISTURE. THIS MEANS HEAVY RAIN ON THE TABLE FOR FOLKS FROM NORTH CAROLINA TO BASICALLY MAINTAIN, IMPRESSIVE RAINFALL RATES AND FLASH FLOODING ACROSS THE MID-ATLANTIC AND THE NORTHEAST. THURSDAY: WE ARE NOT DONE WITH THE RAIN. I THINK WE COULD SEE A LITTLE BIT OF THE SNOW, A WINTRY MIX MIXING INTO AREAS OF NEW ENGLAND, BUT IT IS GOING TO BE ANOTHER DAY WHERE IT IS UNSETTLED. I MENTIONED LAST -- FLASH FLOODING FOR BOSTON, NEW YORK, PHILADELPHIA AND SOME OF THAT ISOLATED FLASH FLOODING IN THE URBAN AREAS AS WE GET THROUGH. THURSDAY: POTENTIAL WIDESPREAD AMOUNTS OF AN INCH OR TWO INCHES OF RAIN IS EXPECTED ANYWHERE. FROM FOUR INCHES OF RAIN IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, THE UMBRELLA WILL BE GOOD ADVICE FOR NOT JUST TODAY BUT THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. >>. IT IS TOO COLD FOR JUST A RAIN. JACKET, I GET CONFUSED. >>>. LATER THIS HOUR, ON TRIAL, THE FATHER OF THE SCHOOL SHOOTER, ETHAN CRUMLEY, FACING CHARGES OF HIS OWN. WE WILL BREAK DOWN THE CASE AS JURY SELECTION GETS UNDERWAY. >>>. FIRST CHINA'S BIGGEST POLITICAL EVENT OF THE YEAR. IT COMES WITH AN UNEXPECTED >>>. WE ARE BACK WITH CHINA AS >>>. WE ARE BACK WITH CHINA AS THE COUNTRY GATHERS FOR THE BIGGEST POLITICAL EVENT OF THE YEAR, KNOWN AS THE TWO SESSION, WHERE OFFICIALS AND POLITICAL ADVISORS OF THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY GATHER FOR TWO ANNUAL MEETINGS. SIMULTANEOUSLY, LEADERS USE THE WEEKLONG MEETINGS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SIGNAL THEIR PLANS FOR THE COMING YEAR. >>. A FEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR JOURNALISTS TO QUESTION LEADERS BUT FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE COUNTRY'S PREMIER WILL NOT TALK TO REPORTERS AT THE CLOSE OF THE MEETING. >>. THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT HAS DECLARED THE COMMITMENT TO TRANSPARENCY BUT THEY ARE STRAPPING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR REPORTERS TO SPEAK WITH CHINESE OFFICIALS. HOW ARE PEOPLE REACTING AND WHAT DOES THIS TELL US ABOUT THE PRESIDENT? >>. THERE'S A LOT OF SURPRISE AND A LOT OF QUESTIONS AROUND THIS MOVE, WHICH TAKES A FAMOUSLY OPAQUE SYSTEM AND MAKES IT EVEN MORE OF A BLACK BOX, BECAUSE IT IS HAPPENING AT A TIME WHEN FOREIGN POLICYMAKERS AND INVESTORS AROUND THE WORLD ARE LOOKING TO CHINA FOR SOME SORT OF SIGNAL ON WHERE THE ECONOMY IS HEADING. PREMIER IS THE COUNTRY'S TOP ECONOMIC OFFICIAL. IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY THAT HE NOW DOESN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT, AND IT ALSO IS A TRADITION THAT ACCOMPANY THE ERA OF REFORMS AND OPENING UP THE NEWS. CONFERENCE HAS HAPPENED FOR DECADES, AND ONE OF THE FEW OPPORTUNITIES WHERE PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO SEE THE TOP-RANKED OFFICIAL PUBLICLY TALKING ABOUT THE STATES AFFAIRS AND A MISSED OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD HIS PUBLIC PROFILE. BUT THE RECENT SPECULATION THAT THAT COULD PART OF THE REASON. >>. IT COULD BE THAT CHINA IS STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW. OBSERVERS AROUND THE WORLD WERE WATCHING TO SEE WHAT ACTION THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT WILL TAKE TO SUPPORT THE ECONOMY. WHAT ARE THEY SAYING? >>. THEY ARE NOT SAYING MUCH ON WHERE THE ECONOMY IS HEADING. THE GROWTH TARGETS FOR CHINA'S ECONOMY HAS BEEN SET AT 5%, WHICH SEEMS AMBITIOUS, AND THERE WERE NO STIMULUS MEASURES THAT A COMPANY THAT GROWS TARGETS HE DID ACKNOWLEDGE. THERE ARE RISKS AHEAD, THAT THERE ARE DIFFICULTIES IN TRYING TO CREATE JOBS, BUT NO BOLD MOVES THAT THE BUSINESS SECTOR WAS LOOKING FOR TO ANSWER HOW IT IS THAT CHINA IS GOING TO DEAL WITH A PROPERTY CRISIS, A SLUMP IN CONSUMER SPENDING, INFLATIO, ALL OF THESE THINGS THAT ARE TROUBLING THE ECONOMY, WHICH OF COURSE MATTERS TO THE UNITED STATES AND THE ECONOMIES AROUND THE WORLD, BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF CHINA'S ECONOMY. >> THERE'S BEEN A LOT. THE CURRENT FORMER MINISTER CONSIDERED AN INTERIM MINISTER. WHAT CAN WE? >>? >> THERE WAS A LOT OF SPECULATION THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME ANNOUNCEMENT OR UNVEILING OF A NEW FOREIGN MINISTER. YOU WILL REMEMBER THAT HE WAS ABRUPTLY FIRED AND IT REALLY KICKED OFF A LOT OF RUMORS, BECAUSE HE WAS WIDELY CONSIDERED PART OF THE CAMPAIGN'S INNER CIRCLE. FOR NOW HE IS HOLDING THE POSITION AGAIN, AND HE IS DOING SO IN ADDITION TO HIS JOB AS THE COUNTRY'S TOP DIPLOMAT. AND, FROM ALL OF THE SIGNALS OR COMMENTS THAT CAME OUT OF THE PRECINCT YESTERDAY, IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THEY ARE GOING TO BE ANNOUNCING A FOREIGN MINISTER AFTER THE SESSION, OR ANYTIME IN THE NEAR FUTURE. THE FRONT-RUNNER IS CONSIDERED TO BE A MAN. HE STARTED AS A TRANSLATOR AND WORKED HIS WAY UP THROUGH THE RANKS, AND HE IS ALREADY DOING A LOT OF THE DIPLOMATIC FOOTWORK BUT HAS NOT QUITE BEEN ANOINTED YET. HE WILL BE CONDUCTING THE FOREIGN MINISTERS NEWS CONFERENCE FOR THESE POLITICAL MEETINGS BEFORE THE END OF THE WEEK. >>>. HAITI IS UNDER A STATE OF EMERGENCY. THIS MORNING, AFTER A MASS JAILBREAK OVER THE WEEKEND, ARMED GANG MEMBERS STORMED THE LARGEST JAIL AND FREED THOUSANDS. NOW THEY ARE TRYING TO SEIZE CONTROL OF HAITI'S LARGEST INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT. ELLISON BARBER HAS MORE >>. Reporter: HAITI SPIRALING TOWARD ANARCHY- THE 72-HOUR STATE OF EMERGENCY DECLARED AFTER ARMED GANGS STORMED TWO OF THE NATION'S LARGEST PRISONS ON SATURDAY AND SUNDAY. ACCORDING TO THE SUNDAY, ACCORDING TO THE GOVERNMENT- CLOSE TO 4000 PRISONERS REPORTEDLY ESCAPED DURING THE VIOLENT ASSAULT. THE EXACT DEATH TOLL IS UNKNOWN, BUT BODIES WERE SEEN LINING THE STREETS OF PORT-au-PRINCE AS POLICE PUBLICLY PLEADED FOR BACKUP. THE ASSOCIATED PRESS REPORTING HEAVILY ON GANGS TRYING TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE LARGEST INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, EXCHANGING GUNFIRE WITH SOLDIERS EXCHANGING GUNFIRE WITH SOLDIERS NOW CONTROLLING 80% OF THE NATIONAL KITTY -- ONE OF THEIR TARGETS. HELPING WITH SEVERAL HIGH-PROFILE INMATES, INCLUDING WORKING -- COLUMBUS -- COLOMBIAN NATIONALS. PERFECT GANG LEADERS, LIKE JIMMY, WHO IS KNOWN AS BARBECUE, HAS BEEN CALLING FOR THE ARREST OF THE ACTING PRESIDENT. FOR MONTHS, BARBECUE DOUBLE DOWN, FOLLOWING THE PRISON ATTACKS, RELEASING A PUBLIC MESSAGE TELLING HAITIANS THE GANGS QUOTE- SEEK TO LIBERATE THE COUNTRY. HE WAS OUT OF THE COUNTRY AT THE TIME, WORKING WITH LEADERS TO FINALIZE AN AGREEMENT THAT WOULD FAST-TRACK FOR A UN APPROVED MISSION AIMED AT REGAINING CONTROL OF THE NATION. VIOLENCE IN HAITI IS NOT NEW, BUT IT IS STEADILY ESCALATING. LAST YEAR, THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE KILLED IN ARMED GANG CONFLICTS WAS TWO TIMES HIGHER THAN THE YEAR BEFORE. >>. TRAPPED WITH A GOVERNMENT THAT DOESN'T GOVERN, INCAPABLE OF DOING ANYTHING, IT LOOKS LIKE THE GANGS, WHICH ARE THE ONLY ONE THAT CAN ESTABLISH ANY KIND OF POLITICAL ORDER IN HAITI, ARE COMING TOGETHER. >>. Reporter FOR THE RESIDENTS OF PORT-au-PRINCE HELPED CANNOT COME THROUGH THE NIGHT. >>. THANKS TO ELLISON BARBER FOR THAT REPORT. THE STATE DEPARTMENT IS MONITORING AND IS URGING UNITED STATES CITIZENS INSIDE OF HAITI TO LEAVE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. >>> JURY SELECTIONS. IN THE TRIAL OF THE SCHOOL SHOOTER -- THE FATHER OF THE SCHOOL SHOOTER. THIS CASE COULD SET A NEW PRECEDENT IN AMERICA. >>> WE ARE GOING TO BRING DOWN THE SYMPTOMS OF SOMETHING CALLED WEEKDAYS AT 7:00.. >>> THE FIRE HAS GROWN BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS. >>. WHAT YOU SEE BEHIND ME IS TYPICAL. >> HOW ARE YOU DOING? >> PRETTY, PRETTY, BAD. >>>. LAST, A MICHIGAN JURY FOUND HIS MOTHER GUILTY OF INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER. PROSECUTORS ACCUSED JAMES CRUMLEY OF FAILURE TO PROPERLY STORE HIS FIREARM AND PROVIDE REASONABLE CARE FOR HIS SON. HE IS CHARGED WITH FOUR COUNTS OF INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER >>. LAWYERS SAY NEGLIGENCE ALLOWED HIS SONS ACCESS TO THE GUN. CRUMLEY HAS PLEADED, NOT UILTY. HIS MOTHER IS CURRENTLY AWAITING, SENTENCING AND FACES UP TO 15 YEARS IN PRISON, WHILE ETHAN CRUMLEY IS FACING LIFE IN PRISON. >>. DANNY IS HERE WITH MORE OF WHAT TO. >> WALK US THROUGH. JURY SELECTION. WHAT KIND OF QUESTIONS DO YOU THINK THIS GROUP WILL ASK? >>. Reporter. THIS IS A VERY SUBURBAN COUNTY. IT'S GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE BUT THERE ARE NO -- IS NO- MAIN CITY FOR THE COUNTY. THERE ARE A LOT OF GUNOWNERS AND A LOT OF HUNTERS. THESE ARE FOLKS THAT WILL BE FAMILIAR MOSTLY, AND THEY WILL HAVE A CLOSE FAMILY RELATIVE WHO HAS A FIREARM. IT MAY BE A SHOTGUN, A BLUNDERBUSS, A PISTOL- IT IS HARD TO SAY, BUT IN A COMMUNITY WITH A LOT OF HUNTERS YOU DO NOT WANT GUNOWNERS ON THIS JURY. IF YOU ARE THE DEFENSE, THAT MAY SOUND COUNTERINTUITIVE, BUT I FIND THAT THERE IS NO HARSHER CRITIC OF GUN OWNERS THAN LAWFUL GUNOWNERS. >>. AS MENTIONED, JENNIFER CRUMLEY FOUND GUILTY ON ALL FOUR COUNTS. JAMES IS NOW FACING THE EXACT SAME CHARGES AND THE FACTS, EXCEPT FOR THIS ADDED ALLEGATION THAT JAMES BOUGHT THE GUN WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR STORING THE GUN. WHAT ARE YOU KIND OF TAKING AWAY FROM WHAT WE SAW WITH JENNIFER CRUMLEY? HOW DO THESE CASES COMPARE? >>. WE HAVE LEARNED SOME FASCINATING THINGS AFTER THE FIRST CRUMLEY TRIAL ENDED AND ONE OF THE FOUR PERSONS MADE THE GROUNDS IMMEDIATE. THE GROUNDS IMMEDIATE. ANYTHING YOU THINK THE JURY IS FOCUSING ON. THEY MAY BE FOCUSING ON SOMETHING ENTIRELY DIFFERENT, AND MOM WAS THE ONE WITH THE LAST ACCESS TO THE GUN, WHICH WAS AN INSIGNIFICANT FACTOR. BUT YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT THE JURY WILL FOCUS ON. MAYBE YOU TAKE FROM THAT THAT YOU FOCUS ON BLAMING THE MOM, FOCUS ON BLAMING SCHOOL OFFICIALS AND FOCUS ON BLAMING YOUR SON, AND MAYBE YOU WILL SEE THEM DO THAT MORE STRIDENTLY. HERE THEY DID A SOFTER VERSION WITH THE MOTHER'S TRIAL. YOU MAY SEE THEM COME OUT REALLY FOCUSING ON BLAMING OTHERS- THIRD PARTIES- FOR THIS SHOOTING, OF WHICH THERE ARE SEVERAL- YOU HAVE THE MOM AND THE SHOOTER HIMSELF. >>. ARE THERE STRATEGIES THAT DEFENSE CAN USE FOR JAMES? THAT MAYBE WERE NOT AN OPTION FOR JENNIFER? >>. Reporter. YES, FOR EXAMPLE, JAMES MIGHT FOCUS ON THE FACT THAT MOM WAS THE LAST PERSON WITH ACCESS TO THIS FIREARM. EVEN, IF JAMES DID PURCHASE THE FIREARM YOU MAY FOCUS ON, MOM TOOK HIM TO THE SHOOTING RANGE. MOM WAS MORE INVOLVED AND I >> THAT WITH THE MOTHER'S TRIAL. I EXPECTED THEM TO POINT THEIR FINGERS AT EACH OTHER MORE. GIVEN THE FACT, THEY HAVE NOT SPOKEN TO EACH OTHER SINCE SHORTLY AFTER THE SHOOTING. I >> CRUMLEY TO TRY POINTING THE FINGER MORE AT THE MOTHER IN THIS CASE THEN THE MOTHER POINTING IT AT JAMES, THE FATHER IN HER CASE. YOU MIGHT SEE A TOTALLY DIFFERENT WITNESS- TESTIFYING. I DON'T THINK ETHAN'S MOTHER TESTIFIED ALL THAT WELL IN HER DEFENSE. IT IS UNDERSTANDABLE THAT TESTIFYING IS SCARY AND MOST FOLKS ARE NOT NATURAL AT. IF JAMES IS A BETTER SPEAKER, YOU MIGHT SEE HIM DO BETTER THAN HIS WIFE DID JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO. >>. DANNY CEBALLOS. THANK YOU SO MUCH. >>>. NOW TO IN NBC NEWS INVESTIGATION, THE FENTANYL FIGHT. AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN GIVEN NEW SCANNERS TO HELP DETECT THE DRUG INSIDE VEHICLES. BUT WE HAVE LEARNED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF THE SCANNERS ARE NOT BEING USED. HOMELAND SECURITY JULIE AVERY TAKES A LOOK. >>. Reporter. WE ARE ON THE FRONT LINES OF THE FENTANYL CRISIS. HALF OF ALL FENTANYL SEES COMING IN FROM MEXICO IS STOPPED HERE. CRITICS SAY THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION IS NOT DOING ENOUGH. WITH FENTANYL OVERDOSES, THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH FOR AMERICANS AGED 18 TO 45, TROY MILLER TELLS US IT IS DRIVEN IN BY VEHICLE. >>. DRIVEN IN BY MEN, WOMEN, YOUNG AND OLD MEXICAN CITIZENS >>. Reporter. BORDER AGENTS HAVE BEGUN USING A NEW TECHNOLOGY TO FIND FENTANYL HIDDEN IN VEHICLES. WE WATCHED AS OFFICERS TALK TO DRIVERS AND INSPECT CARS. THIS IS NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT HAS BEEN INSTALLED FOR CARS. OFFICER SUSPECT MIGHT BE CARRYING NARCOTICS. IT IS CONSIDERED GROUND ZERO FOR FENTANYL TRAFFICKING. >>. Reporter. LIST THAT -- LESS. >>. Reporter. LIST THAT -- LESS THAN 5% ARE ACTUALLY SCANNED WITH MORE NEW TECHNOLOGY. MILLER WANTS TO BRING THOSE NUMBERS UP TO 40% OF CARS AND 70% OF COMMERCIAL TRUCKS, BUT NOT FOR ANOTHER TWO YEARS. >>. Reporter. WHY NOT SCAN EVERY VEHICLE? >>. WE SEE 1 MILLION PEOPLE CROSSING THE BORDER EVERY SINGLE DAY. IF WE TRY TO SCAN EVERY SINGLE SHIPMENT, WE WOULD SHUT DOWN, TRADE AND TRAVEL. >>. Reporter. WE LEARNED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF TAXPAYER PURCHASED SCANNERS ARE SITTING IN WAREHOUSES UNUSED. >>. WE NEED APPROXIMATELY $300 MILLION TO PUT THE TECHNOLOGY ON THE GROUND. >>. Reporter. THE MONEY IS ALREADY SPENT AND IT IS SITTING THERE. IS THAT FRUSTRATING TO YOU? >> VERY FRUSTRATING. >>. Reporter. EVERY YEAR, ENOUGH FENTANYL IS TRAFFIC INTO THE UNITED STATES TO KILL EVERY AMERICAN >>. I THINK THE BORDER NEEDS TO BE CLOSED, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, BECAUSE IT IS A SUPERHIGHWAY AND THEY ARE JUST POURING IN. >>. Reporter. SHE LOST HER SON YEARS AGO WHEN HIS DRUGS WERE LACED WITH FENTANYL >>. YOU ALWAYS ASK THOSE QUESTIONS, BUT I DON'T WANT ANOTHER PARENT TO HAVE TO SAY: >>. THE COMMISSIONER IS ALSO CALLING ON CONGRESS FOR MORE MONEY TO START PUTTING SCANNERS TO USE. >>>. TIME FOR OUR MENTAL HEALTH CHECK AND WE WILL TAKE A LOOK AT THE MENTAL HEALTH IMPACT. >>>. A NEW STUDY SHOWS JUST HOW MUCH OUR PETS CAN BOOST OUR HEALTH >>>. JOINING US TO BREAK IT DOWN IS DOCTOR ROBBIE LUDWICK. WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THE BIG PROBLEMS OF BURNOUT CAUSED BY WORKING TOO MUCH. I UNDERSTAND. THERE IS A PSYCHOLOGIST OUT THERE WHO THINKS MANY OF US MAY BE EXPERIENCING MISALIGNMENT- EARNOUT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN AND HOW CAN WE WORK TO FIX IT? >>. Reporter. MISALIGNMENT BURNOUT IS EXACTLY HOW IT SOUNDS WHEN YOUR JOB IS NOT IN SYNC WITH WHO YOU ARE, WHAT YOUR VALUE SYSTEMS ARE, WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IN THE WORLD, AND IT CAN FEEL SOUL-CRUSHING WHEN THERE IS A MISMATCH, BECAUSE WORK IS WHERE WE SPEND A LOT OF OUR TIME. >>. HOW CAN WE FIX THAT? >>. THE WAY TO FIX IT IS TO ASK YOURSELF WHAT GIVES YOU JOY, WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO? GET SOME SUPPORT FOR YOURSELF. THERE ARE WAYS, BECAUSE WE PAY OUR BILLS. SO THERE ARE CERTAINLY WAYS TO INCORPORATE WHAT YOU LOVE, EITHER THROUGH VOLUNTEERING OR A HOBBY, JUST TO INCORPORATE FEELING PURPOSEFUL AND FEELING THAT YOU ARE IN SYNC WITH WHAT YOU ARE MEANT TO DO. >>. LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW MENTAL HEALTH IS PORTRAYED ON THE BIG SCREEN. TO GET SOME CLASSIC MOVIES LIKE FATAL ATTRACTION AND PSYCHO OFTEN CRITICIZED. BUT A NEW WAVE OF PSYCHOLOGISTS ARE ACTUALLY TRYING TO IMPROVE THE WAY MENTAL HEALTH IS PORTRAYED IN MOVIES. SO WHAT DO YOU THINK WE ARE GETTING WRONG ON THE SCREEN? WHAT SHOULD WE SEE? >>. Reporter. I ALWAYS LIKE TO SAY, WHEN THERAPISTS OR PSYCHIATRISTS ARE MISREPRESENTED SOME WRITER WHO IS VERY ANGRY WITH THEIR OWN THERAPIST BUT WE ARE SEEING A NEW TREND WHERE PSYCHOLOGIST ARE BEING HIRED TO REPRESENT THERAPY AND HEALTH IN A MORE ACCURATE WAY AND IT IS SHIFTING THE WAY CULTURE REALLY SEES THERAPY AND MENTAL HEALTH AND SEEKING TREATMENT. IT IS THE STIGMATIZING WHAT TREATMENT IS ALL ABOUT IN MANY WAYS. THIS IS VERY CONVINCING AND THE MOVIES REALLY ARE A MIRROR AND A WINDOW INTO THE POSSIBILITIES OF WHO WE ARE AND WHAT IS AVAILABLE TO US. >>. A NEW SURVEY SHOWS 84% OF AMERICANS WITH PETS SAY THE ANIMALS GIVE THEM AND MENTAL HEALTH BOOST. THIS IS ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO SHOW THE CLOSER. WE WILL SEE HER IN JUST A SECOND THERE SHE IS LOOK AT THAT. SHE IS ALSO A STRESS REDUCER. BUT HOW DO PETS MAKE SUCH A DIFFERENCE TO PEOPLE WHO? >>. Reporter. PETS OFFER UNCONDITIONAL LOVE, COMPANIONSHIP, AND THEY CAN REDUCE DEPRESSION AND ALSO REDUCE LONELINESS, WHICH IS A BIG EPIDEMIC IN THIS COUNTRY. THE STUDIES ARE TRUE THAT PETS ARE MAN'S BEST FRIEND AND THEY ARE ADORABLE TO HAVE AROUND AS WELL. IT IS A WIN-WIN SITUATION. >>.

TWICE AS HIGH AS 2019.. HIGHER FOR GEN ZERS. WHAT IS BEHIND THIS TREND? >> SIX MONTHS OF PAID TIME OFF. I THINK WHAT IS DRIVING. THIS IS A SHIFT IN THE LANDSCAPE. IT WAS A RUN COMPANY OFFERING YOU A FOOSBALL TABLE FOOD, AND THEN WE HAD WORKING FROM HOME AND THE REAL SHIFT OF PUSHING BACK TO THE OFFICE. SO YOU SAY, LOOK, YOU CAN HAVE SIX MONTHS OFF, AND I THINK THAT IS WHAT IS DRIVING THAT. >>. THESE ARE ONE OF THE HYBRID ASPECTS OF FINDING WORK MODE- ASPECTS OF FINDING WORK MODE FOR A LONG TIME. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE CONCEPT OF DO-NOTHING VACATIONS. WHAT IS THAT? >> VACATION. IT IS INTERESTING BECAUSE IT TELLS US WHEN I WANT TIME OFF. I ACTUALLY WANT TIME OFF. I WAS IN A PRIVATE ISLAND LAST WEEK AND THESE PRIVATE ISLANDS, THE WHOLE POINT OF THEM, IS THAT YOU GO THERE AND YOU ARE NOT GOING SIGHTSEEING. YOU GO THERE TO HAVE SOMEONE BRING YOU A DRINK AND SAY, MAYBE I WILL PLAY A GAME OF TENNIS. IF I WILL PLAY A GAME OF TENNIS, IF I FEEL LIKE IT AND IT CAUSES US TO SAY I JUST WANT TIME OFF. >>.

ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU. >>. FOR MORE ON SUPER TUESDAY, WE ARE JOINED BY OUR POLITICA CORRESPONDENT, STEVE KORNACKI, A THE BIG BOARD AND OUR POLITICS REPORTER, JONATHAN ALLEN. GOOD MORNING TO BOTH OF YOU. LET'S START WITH YOU, JOHN. WHAT ARE YOU WATCHING FOR AS THE RESULTS COME IN? ANY INDICATOR TO TELL HOW TH NIGHT MAY GO >>. I'M WATCHING TO SEE IF THER IS A MAJOR NATIONAL NATURA DISASTER. I DON'T KNOW IF IT WOULD BE A TUMBLE, WEED MAGEDDE OR THE SUN FALLING OUT OF TH SKY, BUT BASICALLY, TRUMP IS EXPECTED TO BARRING A MAJOR DISASTER. CLEAN UP TONIGHT. I THINK STEVE MAY TALK ABOUT THIS BUT IT IS UNLIKELY THAT I WILL CLINCH THE NOMINATION TONIGHT. BUT FROM A PRACTICAL MATTER, IT IS EXPECTED TO: >>. AND THE SUPREME COURT RULED THAT TRUMP IS ABLE TO BE ON TH PRIMARY BALLOT IN COLORADO AND OTHER STATES THAT WERE CHALLENGING HIS ELIGIBILIT, CITING THE 14th AMENDMEN, BECAUSE OF THE EVENTS LEADING TO THE JANUARY 6th ATTACK AT TH CAPITAL. TELL US THE TAKE AWAYS FROM TH DECISION >> NUMBER ONE. I THINK THE EFFORTS DEAD IN TERMS OF NOT JUST COLORADO BUT OTHER STATES THAT WANT TO DO SIMILAR THINGS, TO TRY TO TAKE TRUMP OFF THE BALLOT. IT WAS CLEAR ON THIS: 9-0.. YOU KNOW THE STATES CAN'T TAKE A FEDERAL CANDIDATE OFF TH BALLOT. I ALSO THINK THAT YOU ARE SEEING A NUMBER OF PATHWAYS THAT COUL HAVE PREVENTED DONALD TRUMP FROM THE LEGAL SYSTEM. OR MADE I HARDER FROM THE LEGAL SYSTEM T RUN FOR PRESIDENT OR WIN THE PRESIDENCY, THOSE ARE STARTING TO CLOSE OFF. THERE WAS ONE THING THAT WAS FASCINATING IN THE OPINION WRITTEN BY THE LIBERAL JUSTICE, WHO AGREED THAT COLORADO SHOUL NOT BE ABLE TO TAKE TRUMP OFF OF THE BALLOT, BUT THEY REPEATEDLY REFERRED TO OATH BREAKIN, INSURRECTIONIST, WHICH IS WHERE THEY ARE INCLINED TO GO IN TERMS OF CHALLENGES IN THE FUTUR BASED ON TRYING TO OVERTURN TH 2020 ELECTION. >> STEVE, LET'S BRING IN YOU HERE. I'M GUESSING TUMBLE WEEDS AR NOT ON THE BOARD, BUT GIVE US WHAT WE ARE EXPECTING TONIGHT. >> JOHN, GAVE US THE BOTTOM LIN FOR EXPECTATIONS. YOU SEE THE STATES IN YELLOW THAT WILL BE VOTING TODAY. THIS IS THE CURRENT DELEGATE COUNT, THE MAGIC NUMBER ON TH REPUBLICAN SIDE BEING 1215, AND I THINK A COUPLE OF THINGS TO HIGHLIGHT HERE. NUMBER ONE IS THE BIGGEST DELEGATE PRIZE O THE BOARD FOR REPUBLICANS IS CALIFORNIA: 169 DELEGATES. YOU SEE THE RULE IN CALIFORNIA, NO INDEPENDENTS, NO DEMOCRAT, CAN VOTE. IT IS A CLOSED REPUBLICA PRIMARY. WE HAVE SEEN THE STRENGTH, THE BACK BONE OF IT INDEPENDENT, AN DEMOCRATS, WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO VOTE. NONE OF THAT IN CALIFORNIA, AND CALIFORNIA A WINNER. TAKE ALL STATE. IF TRUMP CAN GET 50% PLUS ONE, HE GETS ALL 169. FOR TEXAS, NO QUITE AS CUT AND DRY A CALIFORNIA, BUT THEY ARE WINNER. TAKE ALL DELEGATES B CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT. EVERY REGION EXPECTS TRUMP WIL GET THE OVERWHELMING SHARE O THOSE BETWEEN THOSE TWO STATES. YO CAN SEE HOW QUICKLY THE NUMBER IS POISED TO RISE FOR TRUMP. OTHER STATES QUICKLY TO NOTE: ALABAMA, ARKANSAS, OKLAHOMA. IN PARTICULAR, THESE COULD BE STATES WHERE TRUMP ESSENTIALLY GETS ALL OF THE DELEGATES BASE ON THE STRENGTH HE HAS WITH TH TYPES OF VOTERS THAT DOMINATE IN THE STATES. EVEN IF HALEY IS GETTING 40%, 43% IN A LOT OF THE STATES- THAT'S HER BEST NUMBER SO FAR- EVEN IF SHE IS GETTING THAT IN A BUNCH OF STATES. THE WAY THE RULES ARE NOW ON THIS DAY FOR THE REPUBLICANS, THE RULES ARE DESIGNED TO GET A QUICK, AN DECISIVE OUTCOME. IT IS NOT GOING TO TRANSLATE T AS MANY DELEGATES >>. WALK US THROUGH. ANY PLACE AMONG THE 13 STATES THAT REPUBLICANS ARE VOTING TODAY WHERE NIKKI HALEY WOULD MAKE HEADWAY >>, THERE ARE A FEW. THE MOST OBVIOUS IS VERMONT. VERMONT IS AN OPEN PRIMARY, NO PARTY REGISTRATION, VERY SMALL STATE. HALEY DID GET 43% IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. VERMONT WAS ONE OF TRUMP'S WORST STATES. THE FIRST TIME HE RAN ONLY 32% OF THE VOTE BACK. THEN JOHN KASICH AND MARCO RUBIO HA A COMBINED MAJORITY FOR THAT I 2016. SHE COULD TAKE A RUN AT TRUMP IN VERMONT, VIRGINIA, IS INTERESTING ESPECIALLY. IN THE NORTHERN PAR OF VIRGINIA, THE KEY TO VIRGINIA, THEY GIVE OUT DELEGATES BASED ON CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS. YOU MENTIONED THE WASHINGTON DC PRIMARY LOW TURNOUT BU. THE WASHINGTON DCELECTORAT HAS A LOT OF OVER LAP WITH THE NORTHERN VIRGINIA DC SUBURBS. HALEY COULD MAKE SOME NOIS AROUND THERE AND PICK UP A FEW DELEGATES. MINNESOTA, COLORADO, COULD D. REASONABLY WELL IN THOSE STATES. AGAIN, VERMONT ONLY HAS 17 DELEGATES. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A SHARE I COLORADO, MINNESOTA EVEN. IF SHE IS DOING THAT, IT WILL B TRUMPED QUICKLY BY ALL OF THES OTHER TRUMP AREAS. >>. LET'S LOOK FORWARD TO THE GENERAL ELECTION. IF WE HAVE BIDEN AND TRUMP REMATCH, WHAT DO THINGS LOOK LIKE? >>. HERE IT IS IN THE LAS, SEVERAL DAYS, FOUR MAJOR NATIONAL POLLS COMING OUT WITH TRUMP AHEAD BETWEEN 2 TO 4 POINTS. IN ALL, FOUR OUR OWN NBC POLL HAD TRUMP AHEAD BY 5. THE OBVIOUS SIGNIFICANCE THERE IS. HOW DIFFERENT THIS LOOKS. FROM THE LAST GO AROUND IN 2020, THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE, NOT ON MAJOR POLL IN 2020. THAT HA BIDEN LOSING TO TRUMP. WE HAVE FOUR HERE IN THE LAS, COUPLE OF DAYS. WHAT IS BEHIND THIS? ONE STAT THAT STANDS OUT IS FROM ""THE NEW YORK TIMES"" POLL THAT CAME OUT A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO, IT ASKED OF TRUMP VOTERS I 2020, HOW MANY ARE STILL WIT HIM. NOW THEY FOUND 97% IN THE POLL. HOW MANY OF BIDEN'S 2020 VOTER STAY WITH BIDEN: 85%. LOOK AT THAT DOUBLE DIGI DIFFERENCE. THAT IS THE FLACK FOR BIDEN: THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BIDEN LEADING EVERY POLL IN 2020 AND SLIGHTL TRAILING IN MANY NOW. >>. EVEN JOHN GETTING US READ FOR THE BIG SUPER TUESDAY. THANK YOU BOTH. STAY WITH US FOR COVERAGE OF SUPER TUESDAY ALL DAY LONG. OUR EXTENSIVE LIVE COVERAGE GETS UNDERWAY TONIGHT AT 5:00 PM, EASTERN TIME. >>>.

UNDER A PROPOSED DEAL FOR TH SIX WEEK CEASE FIRE, HAMAS WOULD RELEASE AROUND 40 HOSTAGES I EXCHANGE FOR AROUND 40 PALESTINIAN PRISONERS. THE DEAL WOULD ALSO BRING MORE. THE DEAL WOULD ALSO BRING MORE AID INTO GAZA, WHERE FAMINE I TIGHTENING ITS GRIP. MORE AIR DROPS ARE PLANNED, BUT IT IS NOT ENOUGH FOR THE DEVASTATION IN GAZA.

BECAUSE THEY ARE ON THE MEN' BASKETBALL TEAM >>. WE DON'T GET A STIPEND OR ANY TYPE OF BENEFIT FROM BEING ATHLETES. EVEN THOUGH WE AR WORKING FULL-TIME JOBS, BASICALLY BY BEING ON THE TEAM. >>. Reporter. THE ONLY WA COLLEGE ATHLETES GET MONEY FOR PLAYING IS THROUGH NAME, IMAGE AND LIKENESS. IT LETS PLAYERS EARN MONEY FOR AUTODPRFS, APPEARANCES, ENDORSEMENTS, BUT NOT DIRECTL FOR WHAT THEY DO ON THE FIELD. SOME, LIKE BRONNY JAMES, CAN RAC UP BIG BUCKS, BUT THOSE OPPORTUNITIES DON' EXIST FOR EVERY ATHLETE. THAT'S WHY HASKINS AND MURTE DECIDED TO FORM A UNION TO GET COMPENSATED, LIKE OTHER EMPLOYEES, RGS SIMILAR TO OTHER STUDENT WAGES ON CAMPUS OR SCHOLARSHIPS. BOTH PLAYERS HAVE HAD TO TAKE ON ESSENTIALLY THIRD JOBS. HASKINS HAS EXPERIENCED UNIONS HELPING TO START ONE AT TH DINING HALL ON CAMPUS >>. WE SAW THE IMPACT AND HOW INFLUENTIAL THE VOICES BECAME.

DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT? >> NO, IT IS AN OLD TERM. IT WAS USED TO KIND OF KEEP TH ATHLETES AS STUDENTS FIRST AND DE-EMPHASIZE THE ATHLETE PART OF IT AND THE FACT THAT WE WORK FOR THE COLLEGE >>. Reporter. LEGAL EXPER MICHAEL McCANN SAYS THES RULINGS COULD BUT THE NCAA O NOTE ES. >> IT IS A GAME CHANGER. IT WOULD BE A FUNDAMENTAL SHIF IN THE MODEL FROM WHERE BY RUL. THESE SCHOOLS CANNOT PAY THE ATHLETES AND THAT MAKES THEM AMATEURS. COLLEGE PLAYERS HAVE A BIG ROL IN GENERATING REVENUE, AN FUNDRAISING GENERATIN ADMISSIONS, SO SCHOOLS MAY RETHINK SOME OF THEIR NUMBERS. >>. Reporter. THE NCAA HAS NO RESPONDED TO REQUEST FOR COMMENT, BUT THERE IS A KEY FACTO WORKING IN ITS FAVOR. OHIO, STATE, MICHIGAN, ARE NOT COVERED BY MIRB. MORE THAN A THIRD OF THE D SCHOOLS ARE PRIVATE, LEAVING THEM WIDE OPEN TO TAKE THE STEP FOR ASKENS AND MURTEN. THEY AR FOCUSED ON BRINGING TOGETHER THE ENTIRE IVY LEAGUE UNDER ON ROOF. >>.

252,wHxDtXGL668,Hallie Jackson NOW - March 7 | NBC News NOW,NBC News,2024-03-08 02:08:19+00:00,"NBC NEWS NOW COVERAGE CONTINUES WITH HALLIE JACKSON RIGHT NOW >>>. WE ARE COMING ON THE AIR >>>. WE ARE COMING ON THE AIR WITH THE STATE OF OUR UNION DIVIDED. TONIGHT, AS THE PRESIDENT WALKING INTO HIS STATE OF THE UNION WITH GRIM APPROVAL RATINGS TRAILING IN MULTIPLE POLLS THIS ELECTION YEAR, WITH MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WATCHING AS HE TRIES TO SHOW HE'S BEST POSITIONED TO TAKE ON DONALD TRUMP AND GET FOLKS FEELING BETTER ABOUT WHERE THIS COUNTRY IS HEADED. WE ARE LIVE FROM THE HILL TO THE WHITE HOUSE, FROM THE BORDER TO THE MIDDLE EAST, COVERING EVERY ANGLE. BREAKING NEWS. TONIGHT, JUST AS WE CAME ON THE AIR, AN ARMY SERGEANT CHARGED WITH SELLING SENSITIVE MILITARY INFORMATION TO CHINA. WE'RE COMBING THROUGH THE INDICTMENT. NOW THE DRAMATIC MOMENTS. A FATHER REALIZED HIS OWN SON MAY HAVE KILLED HIS CLASSMATE AS A SCHOOL IN MICHIGAN. PROSECUTORS ARE TRYING TO PROVE THAT. DAD COULD HAVE PREVENTED IT FROM HAPPENING WHERE THAT TRIAL GOES. NEXT COMING UP AND HUNDREDS OF NATIONAL GUARD MEMBERS SPREAD ACROSS NEW YORK CITY'S SUBWAY SYSTEM. AFTER A NETFLIX TO MAKE ITS MARK IN THE WORLD OF LIVE SPORTS. WE HAVE A LOOK AT THAT A LITTLE LATER ON IN THE SHOW >>>. I'M HALLIE. THIS YEAR TONIGHT, IT MIGHT BE A DIFFERENCE MAKER FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN AS HE FIGHTS FOR HIS POLITICAL LIFE. THIS YEAR YOU'RE ABOUT TO BE LOOKING LIVE THE BUILDING HE WOULD LIKE TO KEEP CALLING HOME. SOMEWHERE IN THERE HE'S PROBABLY PUTTING HIS PROVERBIAL RED PEN TO PAPER WITH LAST-SECOND ADDS OR CUTS. HE'LL CRUISE THE TWO-MILE PATH DOWN PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE TO CAPITOL HILL JUST BLOCKS FROM WHERE I'M STANDING. WHERE I'M STANDING, LAWMAKERS ON BOTH SIDES WILL BE LISTENING CAREFULLY. EXPECT PRESIDENT BIDEN TO PITCH YOU ON HIS ECONOMIC RECORD ON A DAY THAT THE STOCK MARKET IS HITTING A RECORD HIGH. HE'S GOING TO TALK ABOUT DEMOCRACY, ABOUT FREEDOM, AS TWO WARS RAGE OVERSEAS. WE KNOW CLIMATE IS A BIG ISSUE FOR HIM AND VOTING ACCESS AS WELL. THE BACKDROP POLLS SHOWING THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE FOR A LOT OF AMERICANS IS IMMIGRATION. SO WATCH FOR THE PRESIDENT TO TRY TO FLIP THE SCRIPT AND PUT REPUBLICANS ON DEFENSE ON THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS AT THE BORDER EVEN. AS THE GOP IS ACCUSING THE PRESIDENT OF FAILING TO DOES JOB ON THAT, OUR SOURCES SAY THERE'S NO PLAN TO ROLL OUT A NEW EXECUTIVE ACTION, SO THEN WHAT? ANOTHER QUESTION: HOW WILL HE HELP WITH A VIBE SHIFT ON THE ECONOMY? REMEMBER, THE NUMBERS ARE LOOKING BETTER BUT PEOPLE ARE NOT FEELING BETTER, AND OUR SOURCES SAY THE PRESIDENT'S GOING TO ROLL OUT A NEW PLAN TO BUILD A PORT IN GAZA, SO THAT HUMANITARIAN HELP, LIKE FOOD, CAN GET TO CIVILIANS WHO SO DESPERATELY NEED IT. CAN THAT QUIET CRITICS WHO WANT HIM TO DO MORE FOR A CEASEFIRE AND THE OVERARCHING QUESTION: TONIGHT, NO POLICY, NO EXECUTIVE ACTION CAN CHANGE HIS AGE AND ALL THE WORRIES THAT COME WITH IT. FOR FOR MANY AMERICANS CAN HE SHOW 81 IS JUST A NUMBER AND THE NUMBER THEY SHOULD BE LOOKING AT IS FOUR, AS IN THAT MANY MORE YEARS IN THE WHITE HOUSE, JULIA AINSLEY AND CHRISTINE ROMANS. BUT KELLY O'DONNELL HAS BEEN WORKING HER SOURCES FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS ON THIS. THE PRESIDENT WILL HAVE TO TRY TO ANSWER THE QUESTION THAT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WATCHING TONIGHT MAY HAVE: KELLY, WHAT IS YOUR PLAN TO MAKE THE NEXT FOUR YEARS BETTER, AND IS IT A BETTER PLAN THAN DONALD TRUMP'S THE NUMBERS SHOW? HE HAS TO FIND A WAY TO DO THAT >>. Reporter. VERY MUCH ON THE MINDS OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS SPEECH WITH THE PRESIDENT AND WHAT YOU WILL HEAR TONIGHT: HIS EFFORT TO TELL THE STORY OF HIS TIME IN OFFICE, WHY HE WAS ORIGINALLY ASKED BY VOTERS TO SERVE MEANING. WHAT WAS LIFE BACK IN THE TRUMP ERA. REALLY LIKE WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE TIMES THAT WE WERE IN THERE WITH THE PANDEMIC, WITH WHAT HAPPENED ON JANUARY 6th, AND MANY PEOPLE POINT TO THE ECONOMY IN THE TRUMP YEARS, WILL EXPECT THIS PRESIDENT TO TALK ABOUT THINGS LIKE HOW INFLATION HAS COME DOWN, HOW JOBS ARE STRONG- 15 MILLION- DURING HIS TIME IN OFFICE LAYING OUT A LOT OF THE ECONOMIC FACTORS THAT WE TALK ABOUT, THAT SHOW A RESILIENCE IN OUR ECONOMY, A STRENGTH COMPARED TO ALL THE OTHER BIG ECONOMIC POWERS IN THE WORLD, AND TRY TO SELL THAT IN A LONG FORM, WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WATCHING TONIGHT. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HIS ADVISORS BELIEVE VERY STRONGLY IS THAT MANY AMERICANS HAVE NOT BEEN TUNED IN OR THEY'VE BEEN SEEING THINGS ON THEIR SOCIAL MEDIA FEEDS THAT ARE SHORT SNIPPETS OF JOE BIDEN. THIS IS A CHANCE TO SORT OF BE IN THE ROOM WITH HIM FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME AS HE TELLS THE STORY OF WHERE WE'VE BEEN, WHERE HE WANTS TO GO AND WHAT HIS NEW POLICY IDEAS ARE, AND TO PUT SOME MEET ON THE BONE OF ALL OF THAT IN SOME STARK WAYS, DRAWING A CONTRAST WITH THE REPUBLICAN VISION OF THOSE IN THE HOUSE THAT HE'LL BE ADDRESSING TONIGHT AS WELL AS, IF NOT SPOKEN IN NAME, CERTAINLY BY INFERENCE, REFERRING TO HIS PREDECESSOR AND HIS CURRENT RIVAL, DONALD TRUMP. SO A LOT OF THAT WILL PLAY OUT. AGE IS CERTAINLY A CONSIDERATION, AND ONE OF THE THINGS WE HEAR FROM ADVISORS IS THE PRESIDENT WILL WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT HE ARGUES HIS IDEAS ARE MORE ABOUT THE FUTURE, WHEN COMPARED TO DONALD TRUMP, WHO IS JUST A COUPLE OF YEARS YOUNGER, SO THEY'RE WITHIN THE SAME AGE GROUP. THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN IN HIGH SCHOOL TOGETHER. IF THAT GIVES YOU A SENSE OF IT AND THAT DONALD TRUMP, IN THEIR VIEW, HAS VIEWS THAT ARE BEHIND THE TIMES, IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 20th CENTURY, WHEN IT COMES TO ABORTION RIGHTS AND VOTING RIGHTS, THEY'LL TRY TO DRAW THAT CONTRAST. THEY ROAD TESTED IT ONSET MEYERS, AND EXPECT THAT IN A MORE PERHAPS, A POLISHED FORM FOR THE STATE OF THE ROOM TONIGHT BUT THAT SAME MESSAGE WILL PLAY OUT: >>. ONE OF THE THINGS YOU REFERENCED, KELLY, THIS NEW NEWS OFTENTIMES. THE PRESIDENT WILL MAKE SOME NEWS DURING THE STATE OF THE UNION, THE IDEA OF THIS CONSTRUCTION OF AN EMERGENCY PORT IN GAZA. THIS HAS BEEN AN ISSUE. THE PRESIDENT'S HANDLING OF THE ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR. IT IS NOT A POLICY ISSUE FOR HIM BUT A POLITICAL ONE AS WELL >>. Reporter. THEY EXPECT THE PRESIDENT WILL TRY TO DEMONSTRATE, WITH THIS PARTICULAR NEW IDEA, THE AMERICAN COMMITMENT TO TRYING TO HELP THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN SUFFERING WITH FAMINE, WITH ILLNESS, WITH DEATH AND VIOLENCE, AND TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE EXTENT AND THE PAIN OF WHAT PALESTINIANS HAVE BEEN GOING THROUGH DURING THE ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR, WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT ISRAEL HAS A RIGHT TO DEFEND THEMSELVES. THEY HAVE TO GET THE HOSTAGES OUT, THAT A TEMPORARY CEASEFIRE HAS TO HAPPEN. THE PRESIDENT WILL GIVE SOME SPACE, SOME TIME AND MAYBE EVEN EXPECTATION OF HEARING FROM THOSE IN THE ROOM ABOUT HOW THIS ISSUE IS DEEPLY IMPORTANT TO MANY AMERICANS AND THEY EXPECT THAT TO BE REFLECTED IN SOME OF THE GUESTS WHO ARE ATTENDING TONIGHT AND IN THIS NEW AND SIGNIFICANT POLICY. THIS IS AMERICAN SERVICE MEMBERS CREATING AND HELPING TO BUILD A PORT, BEING ON THE WATER BUT CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THE CONFLICT- A SIGNIFICANT STEP THEY THINK, WITH HUMANITARIAN AID, TO FOCUS ON THAT, TO LEAN INTO THAT, TO ANSWER AN ISSUE THAT IS BOTH ONE. THAT IS A CURRENT EVENT, IT IS DEEPLY CONTEST. WHERE HAD THE WAR? AND ONE, AS YOU POINTED OUT, WITH POLITICAL RAMIFICATIONS FOR >>. KELLY O'DONNELL LIVE IN FRONT OF THE WHITE HOUSE. LET ME BRING IN CHRISTINE ROMANS, WHO IS JOINING US HERE ON SET. YOU'VE BEEN TALKING WITH WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS ABOUT THE ECONOMIC PIECE OF PRESIDENT BIDEN'S SPEECH TONIGHT, AND IT'S COMING ON A DAY WHEN, IN JUST THE LAST HOUR, WE SAW NEW RECORDS WITH THE S AND P AND NASDAQ CLOSING HIGHER THAN THEY'VE EVER CLOSED. THOSE NUMBERS ARE UP. WE KNOW THE MARKET'S- NOT THE ECONOMY, BUT INFLATION IS MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND A LOT OF AMERICANS ARE LIKE I DON'T FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT. >>. ALL THOSE TOP-LINE NUMBERS I MEAN SHOULD TELL YOU THIS IS A GREAT ECONOMY BUT THOSE AREN'T LANDING ON THE AMERICAN CONSUMER AND THE AMERICAN VOTER. I'LL GIVE YOU ONE NUMBER I THINK IS IMPORTANT HERE: THE GROCERY BILL. GROCERY PRICES IN THE CPI- UP 25% SINCE JANUARY 2020.. THAT MEANS YOUR GROCERY BILL IS 25% HIGHER THAN BEFORE PRESIDENT BIDEN CAME INTO OFFICE. THAT IS A NUMBER THAT REALLY BOTHERS, PEOPLE, BOTHERS, PEOPLE. WHAT YOU'LL HEAR. YOU HAVE 3.7% UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, DEFYING EXPECTATIONS ALL AROUND, BUT THE PRESIDENT TONIGHT IS GOING TO SAY: I FEEL YOUR PAIN. I KNOW YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE NICKELED AND DIMED. I GET IT, KNOW. THE STOCK MARKET IS NOT YOUR LIFE AND YOUR KITCHEN TABLE. THERE ARE TWO CHOICES HERE AND I'M THE GUY WHO'S SITTING AROUND THE KITCHEN TABLE WITH YOU TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE THINGS COST BETTER FOR YOU. >>. IF WE'RE TALKING HIGHLIGHTS AND LOW LIGHTS, BREAK IT DOWN THAT WAY. >>. HE'LL TALK ABOUT TAX FAIRNESS. HE'S GOING TO TALK ABOUT CORPORATIONS, CORPORATE GREED, SLINKFLATION, NICKEL AND DIMING PEOPLE. I DON'T KNOW THAT MESSAGE HAS LANDED, REALLY YET, BUT THEY HAVE BEEN PUSHING THIS. WE'LL FIND NEW WAYS IN THE HOUSING MARKET WITH CLOSING COSTS. ALL THESE DIFFERENT WAYS. HE'S TRYING TO SAY: I'M SAVING YOU A FEW BUCKS. ALL TAKEN TOGETHER, IT'S DIFFERENT THAN THE MESSAGE YOU'RE HEARING ON THE OTHER SIDE, WHICH MAYBE HE'LL NOD TO TONIGHT, WHICH IS ABOUT TAX CUTS FOR COMPANIES. IT'S NOT ABOUT THE LITTLE GUY. IT'S ABOUT HEALTHCARE, HEALTHCARE COSTS, DRUG PRICES. YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR A LOT ABOUT THIS TONIGHT. >>. IF YOU'RE WATCHING, GIVE US A VIEWER'S GUIDE. I'M GOING TO BE LOOKING TONIGHT FOR THE OVERALL, TONE, OVERALL, MESSAGING, ANY SORT OF UNEXPECTED MOMENTS. AS A BUSINESS REPORTER, WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR? WHAT'S YOUR VIEWERS GUIDE? >>. WILL HE WILL ABLE TO LAND THE WORKING CLASS JOE PERSONA TONIGHT, AND WILL HE BE ABLE TO CONNECT WITH TAX RATES AND WILL THAT LAND WITH THE AMERICAN VOTER AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE? I THINK THAT'S THE MESSAGE THEY'RE TRYING TO SEND. ALSO, THE ECONOMY IS GOOD, OVERALL THE POLLS DON'T SHOW. ANYBODY FEELS THAT WAY. THAT IS. IT'S NOT EVEN A NEEDLE TO THREAD. IT IS A BIG OLD, GRAND CANYON BETWEEN RIGHT >>. IT'S THE CENTRAL TENSION >>. IT REALLY IS. >> COME BACK TO DC MORE. >> I LOVE IT. >> I'M EXCITED TO HAVE YOU HERE HERE. >>>. LET'S GO TO OUR HOMELAND SECURITY CORRESPONDENT JULIA AINSLEY. THE PRESIDENT IS LOOKING TO FLIP THE SCRIPT AND POINT THE FINGER AT HOUSE REPUBLICANS TO SAY IT'S YOUR FAULT TO NOT GET ANYTHING PASSED. >>. Reporter. HERE IN THE STATE OF TEXAS, IMMIGRATION IS NOT A NEW ISSUE. THEY'VE HAD PEOPLE COMING ACROSS THE BORDER OBVIOUSLY FOR DECADES, BECAUSE OF THE INCREDIBLE INFLUX THAT WE'VE SEEN OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS, ESPECIALLY THE RECORD-BREAKING YEAR LAST YEAR, WITH MIGRANTS COMING ILLEGALLY INTO THE COUNTRY, SO MANY GOING TO NEW YORK, DENVER, CHICAGO, DEMOCRATIC STRONGHOLDS AND OVERWHELMING THE RESOURCES OF SOME OF THOSE CITIES. IMMIGRATION IS BECOMING A TOP ISSUE FOR MORE AND MORE VOTERS. EVEN THOUGH, THE PRESIDENT HAS DONE A NUMBER OF EXECUTIVE ACTIONS ON THAT. WHAT WE UNDERSTAND FROM HIS MESSAGING TONIGHT IS HE WILL SAY THAT IT IS UP TO REPUBLICANS TO TAKE THE NEXT STEP. FOR MORE REPORTING FROM MYSELF AND MY WHITE HOUSE COLLEAGUES, THERE WAS A LOT OF DELIBERATION ABOUT THE TIMING OF FURTHER EXECUTIVE ACTION. AS YOU KNOW, THEY DID NOT GET THAT BORDER. SECURITY PIECE PASSED AND THE NATIONAL SECURITY SUMP LIMITTAL. THERE WON'T BE ENOUGH MONEY GOING FORWARD TO MAINTAIN THE STATUS QUO AT THE BORDER. THERE'S A LOT OF DEBATE IN THE WHITE HOUSE. IF THEY TOOK UNILATERAL ACTION BEFORE THE STATE OF THE UNION, OR IF THE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCED AN EXECUTIVE ACTION DURING STATE OF THE UNION, WOULD THAT SOMEHOW MAKE THEM LOSE THE NARRATIVE. IN OTHER WORDS WOULD REPUBLICANS SAY IT WAS UP TO BIDEN ALL ALONG. HE SHOULD HAVE DONE THIS IT'S ON US INSTEAD. THEY WAITED. WE MAY SEE FURTHER ACTION COMING IN THE NEXT MONTH. HE WANTS TO PIN THIS ON REPUBLICANS. THEY NEED MORE FUNDING. THERE WAS AN AGREEMENT, REALLY ONE OF THE MOST CONSERVATIVE IMMIGRATION AGREEMENTS REACHED IN THE SENATE. WE HAVE SEEN IN DECADES THAT WOULD HAVE VASTLY CHANGED THE WAY MIGRANTS CAN CLAIM ASYLUM WHEN THEY COME INTO THE COUNTRY. THAT WAS BLOCKED BECAUSE REPUBLICANS DIDN'T THINK IT WENT FAR ENOUGH. I THINK HE'LL TRY TO MAKE THE CASE THAT HE IS NOT AN OPEN- BORDER PRESIDENT. IF YOU'RE LOOKING BIG PICTURE HOW FAR THIS PRESIDENT AND REALLY MOST DEMOCRATS HAVE CHANGED IN THEIR RHETORIC ON THIS ISSUE SINCE TRUMP LEFT OFFICE >>. WHAT'S INTERESTING. FOLKS ARE WATCHING AND MIGHT BE LOOKING AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN SAYING THE HOUSE PASSED AN IMMIGRATION BILL TODAY EXPLAIN THAT THIS WAS NAMED AFTER LINCOLN REILLY, THE NURSING STUDENT KILLED IN ATHENS, GEORGIA- THE BILL OBVIOUSLY HONORING HER. WE'VE SEEN HER PARENTS INVITED BY ONE GEORGIA, REPUBLICAN TO THE STATE OF THE UNION. THEY WILL NOT BE THERE, BUT THERE WILL BE AN EMPTY SEAT IN LINCOLN'S HONOR. EXPLAIN THAT PIECE OF IT. >>. Reporter: RIGHT LINCOLN- OBVIOUSLY A TRAGEDY HER DEATH. REPUBLICANS ARE SEIZING ON THAT BECAUSE THEY SAY THAT SHE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN KILLED IF THIS PERSON HADN'T BEEN ALLOWED TO COME INTO THE COUNTRY AND IF THE MAN SUSPECTED IN HER DEATH HAD NOT BEEN RELEASED BY NYPD AND NOT TURNED OVER TO ICE FOR DEPORTATION. THEY'RE ABLE TO SEIZE ON THAT, PASSING THIS HARD-LINE BILL, PROBABLY NOT LIKELY TO GO VERY FAR, BUT THEY WILL CONTINUE TO USE HER LIKENESS TO MAKE THOSE POINTS TO SAY THAT: LOOK, THERE ARE REAL HUMAN CONSEQUENCES TO THIS. WE SHOULD POINT OUT. MOST DATA SHOWS THAT US CITIZENS PER CAPITA COMMIT MORE CRIMES THAN PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE COUNTRY WITHOUT CITIZENSHIP. >>. LIVE FOR US THERE IN TEXAS, JULIA, THANKS. LET'S BRING IT BACK NOW TO WASHINGTON, TO THE BUILDING THAT I CAN SEE OUT OF THE CORNER OF MY EYE. THAT IS THE CAPITOL. SALSAHIL KAPUR IS THERE. THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS, THAT WE DON'T THINK WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. MAYBE SOMEBODY YELLS SOMETHING. MAYBE THERE IS SOME SORT OF MOMENT FROM REPUBLICAN MEMBERS. HERE THE HOUSE SPEAKER IS TELLING HIS COLLEAGUES TO BE RESPECTFUL SAYING. DECORUM IS THE ORDER OF THE DAY AFTER HECKLING. BEFORE, TALK US THROUGH WHAT YOU'RE WATCHING FOR TONIGHT AS IT RELATES TO THE CHAMBER ITSELF. >>. Reporter. THIS IS GOING TO BE HIS FIRST TIME ON THAT DAIS AT A STATE OF THE UNION SITTING RIGHT NEXT TO THE PRESIDENT. HE WANTS HIS MEMBERS TO ESSENTIALLY BEHAVE TO AVOID THE KIND OF YELLING AND OUTBURSTS AND HECKLING THAT WE SAW LAST YEAR AND THE FIRST YEAR OF THIS NEW HOUSE. REPUBLICAN MAJORITY MEMBERS LIKE LAUREN BOEBERT AND MARJORIE TAYLOR GREEN CREATED KIND OF A RAUCOUS. MIKE JOHNSON DOESN'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN. THEY'RE EIGHT MONTHS AWAY FROM AN ELECTION AND JOHNSON WANTS TO TAMP DOWN ON THIS IMAGE OF REPUBLICANS AS A PARTY OF ANGER AND CHAOS AND TRY TO APPEAL TO VOTERS WHETHER. HE HAS CONTROL OVER THESE MEMBERS. THAT'S AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT QUESTION. THE TWO WOMEN I BROUGHT UP: THEY CONSIDER THEMSELVES REBELS WHO DON'T TAKE ORDERS FROM HOUSE, REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP, AT LEAST PEOPLE WHO AREN'T FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP. THEY DON'T SEE THEMSELVES FOLLOWERS OF LEADERSHIP MEMBERS. THE OTHER THING THAT SOME DEMOCRATS ARE A LITTLE BIT, YOU KNOW ANXIOUS ABOUT AND AT LEAST BRACING FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF IS. SOME PROTESTS ARE HECKLING FROM THE LEFT. NOT THAT THEY HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THIS WILL HAPPEN, BUT WE'VE SEEN DEMOCRATIC EVENTS GET REPEATEDLY DISRUPTED, INCLUDING PRESIDENT BIDEN'S EVENTS OVER PROTESTS ABOUT THE WAR IN GAZA. US POLICY TOWARD ISRAEL. THIS IS A SITUATION WHERE MEMBERS CAN INVITE THEIR OWN GUESTS AND THE WHITE HOUSE IS NOT ABLE TO PUT THE TIGHT LIDONE VENTS THAT BIDEN HAS HAD RECENTLY. TIME WILL TELL WHETHER THAT PANS OUT THE WAY THEY WANT IT TO. >> THE GUESTS WHO ARE IN THE AUDIENCE. EVERY MEMBER GETS TO BRING A GUEST, INCLUDING THE SPEAKER HIMSELF. >>. Reporter MIKE JOHNSON HAS A LONG LIST OF GUESTS WHO REPRESENT THE TYPES OF ISSUES THAT MIKE JOHN WANTS TO HIGHLIGHT. HE'S USING IT SPECIFICALLY TOWARD THIS END. THAT INCLUDES PARENTS OF HOSTAGES IN ISRAEL. A FREED HOSTAGE IN ISRAEL TRYING TO HIGHLIGHT HIS AND HIS PARTY'S UNEQUIVOCAL SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL. A JEWISH STUDENT AT MIT TRYING TO DRAW ATTENTION TO THE ISSUE OF ANTI-SEMITISM, ESPECIALLY ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES. TWO POLICE OFFICERS ATTACKED BY UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS. A MOM OF A CHILD KILLED BY THE MS-13 GANG CREATING THIS NEXUS OF MIGRANTS AND CRIME AS WELL AS A UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT WHO OPPOSES TRANSGENDER ATHLETES. THERE'S THE PARENTS OF IMPRISONED WALL STREET JOURNALIST, WHICH IS AN INTERESTING TACTIC FOR SPEAKER JOHNSON, BECAUSE HE'S GOTTEN A LOT OF CRITICISM FOR NOT DOING ENOUGH TO CONFRONT RUSSIA. >>. SAHIL KAPUR, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IT IS OBVIOUSLY A LOT. THERE'S GOING TO BE EVEN MORE TONIGHT AS OUR SPECIAL COVERAGE OF THE STATE OF THE UNION STARTS JUST A FEW HOURS FROM NOW, JUST THREE HOURS FROM NOW. ON NBC NEWS. NOW, HOWEVER YOU'RE WATCHING, TUNE IN, YOU'LL SEE MYSELF, TOM LLAMAS, MANY OF OUR COLLEAGUES AND FRIENDS ACROSS THE COUNTRY GETTING YOU READY FOR THIS BIG MOMENT FOR THE PRESIDENT: >>>. TAKE YOU DOWN SOUTH TO NASHVILLE. BREAKING NEWS FROM THERE, WHERE A US ARMY SERGEANT HAS BEEN INDICTED FOR SELLING SENSITIVE MILITARY INFORMATION TO A CO CONSPIRATOR IN CHINA >>. THE DEFENDANT IS CHARGED WITH ENTERING INTO A MULTI-YEAR CONSPIRACY TO ILLEGALLY EXPLOIT HIS ACCESS TO NATIONAL DEFENSE INFORMATION FOR HIS OWN FINANCIAL BENEFIT. HE TRADED OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE INFORMATION FOR CASH >>. I WANT TO BRING IN TOM WINTER, FOR NOW IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE THIS GUY WAS ACCUSED OF SELLING SECRETS TO CHINA. IS THAT RIGHT? >>. Reporter WELL, THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT, HALLIE. APPARENTLY, STARTING BACK IN JUNE OF 2022, KORBEIN SCHULTZ, WHO WAS ARRESTED BY THE FBI THIS MORNING AT FORT CAMPBELL, STARTED COMMUNICATING. AFTER IT WAS REACHED OUT BY A CONSPIRATOR BASED IN HONG KONG. THIS INDIVIDUAL IS A FOREIGN NATIONAL, SAYS HE LIVES IN HONG KONG, SAYS HE'S A BUSINESS CONSULTANT, INTERESTING THE WAY THE INDICTMENT IS WORDED. REACHED OUT TO SCHULTZ. AND APPARENTLY, YOU'RE LOOKING AT A PHOTO OF HIM HERE, APPARENTLY STARTED ASKING HIM FOR CLASSIFIED INFORMATION, SECRET INFORMATION, AND SCHULTZ IS NOT CHARGED WITH SHARING ANY SORT OF CLASSIFIED OR TOP SECRET INFORMATION, BUT WITH NATIONAL DEFENSE INFORMATION. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT F-22, THE FIGHTER, THE RAPTOR FIGHTER, THE MANUALS ASSOCIATE. WHERE HAD THAT SENSITIVE MILITARY TECHNOLOGY AS IT PERTAINS TO NUCLEAR WEAPONS, AS IT PERTAINS TO DEFENSE CAPABILITIES OF THE US, AS IT PERTAINS TO HELICOPTERS, AND EXACTLY WHAT THE US' OBSERVATIONS OF ITS OWN MILITARY DRILLS BY CHINA WERE INCLUDING HIS THOUGHTS ON WHAT THE US MIGHT DO IF TAIWAN WOULD BE ATTACKED. ALL THIS TYPE OF INFORMATION. AND IT WAS JUST THREE DAYS AGO YOU AND I WERE SITTING ON SET TOGETHER TALKING ABOUT A SEPARATE CASE INVOLVING A MEMBER OF THE UNITED STATES MILITARY, ABOUT JUST HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS FOR A FOREIGN COUNTRY TO UNDERSTAND THE US' THINKING ABOUT THAT FOREIGN COUNTRY'S CAPABILITIES OR OBSERVATIONS. SO THIS IS SERIOUS. IT'S THE THIRD CASE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS WEEK AND IT'S SOMETHING. WE'RE KEEPING TRACK ON AS FAR AS THE TREND OF THIS OUR OWN PEOPLE SHARING OUR OWN INFORMATION >>. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BRINGING US THAT DEVELOPING NEWS TONIGHT >>>. COURT WRAPPING UP TONIGHT IN MICHIGAN WITH AN INTENSE MOMENT: THE FATHER OF A SCHOOL SHOOTER REALIZING HIS SON MAY HAVE BEEN THE GUNMAN IN A SECOND OF ITS KIND TRIAL- KIND TRIAL. I WANT YOU TO LISTEN TO THIS. I WANT YOU TO LISTEN TO THIS DRAMATIC MOMENT. THAT'S JAMES CRUMBLEY IN COURT. THAT'S JAMES CRUMBLEY IN COURT TODAY. THE 47-YEAR-OLD FATHER IS FACING FOUR COUNTS OF INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER- THE SAME HIS WIFE FACED JUST LAST MONTH. THE JURY FOUND HER GUILTY FOR THE DEATH OF THESE FOUR STUDENTS- STUDENTS KILLED IN THE 2021 SHOOTING ATTACK AT OXFORD HIGH SCHOOL. THEIR SON IS SERVING LIFE IN PRISON FOR THAT. MAGGIE VESPA IS IN PONTIAC, MICHIGAN. WE HAVEN'T SEEN THIS BEFORE JENNIFER CRUMBLEY'S TRIAL: A PARENT BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR CHILD OPENING FIRE AT THEIR SCHOOL. THE MOTHER FOUND GUILTY. NOW THE FATHER IS ON TRIAL. WALK US THROUGH IT AND HOW. IT'S DIFFERENT FROM JENNIFER'S TRIAL- THE MOM'S TRIAL >>. Reporter. YEAH, HALLIE, IT WAS STRIKING AS YOU POINT OUT. THIS IS STILL A MAJOR PRECEDENT BEING SET LEGALLY. THIS IS ONLY THE SECOND OF ITS KIND CASE. HOWEVER, TO SOME DEGREE, THIS FEELS LIKE A BIT OF A RINSE AND REPEAT FROM JENNIFER CRUMBLEY'S CASE JUST A MONTH AGO. THE DEFENSE'S OPENING STATEMENT- CRUMBLEY'S ATTORNEY ONLY SPEAKING FOR SEVEN MINUTES TOTAL. THE DEFENSE WAS SIMILAR TO WHAT WE HEARD IN JENNIFER'S CASE. JAMES CRUMBLEY COULDN'T HAVE KNOWN WHAT HIS TEENAGE SON WAS PLANNING. HE HAD NO REASON TO THINK HIS SON WAS A DANGER. THE PROSECUTION IN THIS CASE. THEY HAVE SOME DELINEATING FACTORS SAYING THAT SPECIFICALLY, JAMES CRUMBLEY WAS THE ADULT IN THE HOUSE IN CHARGE OF SECURING THE GUN. THAT IS KEY TO THEIR CASE AND A DIFFERENT FACTOR FROM JENNIFER CRUMBLEY'S CASE. HE ASKED HIS PARENTS, INCLUDING HIS FATHER, FOR HELP. THEY DECLINED TO GET HIM HELP, INSTEAD BUYING THE GUN AND TAKING HIM TO A SHOOTING RANGE. HERE IS SOME OF WHAT WE HEARD IN THE OPENING STATEMENTS TODAY: >> INSTEAD OF RECEIVING HELP OR INTERVENTION OF ANY KIND, JAMES CRUMBLEY INSTEAD BEGAN TO TAKE HIS SON TO THE SHOOTING RANGE THIS NIGHTMARE. THESE MURDERS WERE PREVENTABLE BY HIM, FORESEEABLE BY HIM. >> WHEN YOU'RE NOT AWARE OF AN IMMEDIATE, IMMINENT DANGER, WHY WOULD YOU DO ANYTHING DIFFERENT THAN WHAT YOU NORMALLY DO? >>. SO AGAIN, JUST A REMINDER. A LOOT OF WHAT WE'RE HEARING IN THIS CASE IS SIMILAR TO WHAT WE HEARD IN JENNIFER'S CASE. LET'S WALK THROUGH THE PARTICULARS OF THAT ONE. SHE FACED THE SAME CHARGES: FOUR COUNTS OF INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER. THE JURY LIBERATED FOR JUST 11 HOURS, EFFECTIVELY TWO DAYS. WE HEARD FROM 21 WITNESSES IN THAT CASE, INCLUDING LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS, COWORKERS OF JENNIFER CRUMBLEY, INCLUDING HER BOSS AT THE TIME, AND THEN ALSO A LOT OF SCHOOL STAFFERS THEMSELVES. A LOT OF THOSE WITNESSES ON THE WITNESS LIST IN THIS CASE, AS WELL, ONE KEY POINT THOUGH THE DEFENSE IN THAT CASE ONLY CALLING JENNIFER HERSELF TO THE STAND. AND HALLIE, AT THIS POINT WE DON'T KNOW IF JAMES CRUMBLEY WILL FOLLOW HIS WIFE'S LEAD AND TAKE THE STAND. HIS ATTORNEYS HAVEN'T LAID OUT THEIR PLANS. YET >> ONE OF THE BIG THINGS WE'RE WATCHING FOR WILL HE TAKE THE STAND IN HIS OWN DEFENSE. WE'VE SEEN JUST TODAY MAGGIE MO OF A GLIMPSE INTO SOME OF THE COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN THE PARENTS AND THEIR SON. I THINK RIGHT IN THE DAYS LEADING UP TO THIS EXPLAIN THAT >>. Reporter. YEAH, EXACTLY, WE HAD A COMPUTER CRIMES ANALYST ON THE STAND TODAY TALKING ABOUT AND WALKING THE JURY THROUGH TEXT MESSAGES THAT ETHAN HAD SENT ONE OF HIS GOOD FRIENDS AT THE TIME. THESE KIDS HAVE EXCHANGED THOUSANDS OF TEXT MESSAGES. IT WAS ONE OF THE ONLY FRIENDS HE HAD, BASICALLY THE CRIMES ANALYST SAYING HE HAD TOLD HIS PARENTS. HE TEXTED HIS FRIEND. HE TOLD HIS PARENTS HE WANTED TO GET MENTAL HEALTH HELP AND HE TOLD HIS FRIEND THAT HIS DAD GAVE HIM SOME PILLS AND TOME HIM. TO QUOTE: SUCK IT UP. THAT SEEMED TO BE A KEY POINT FOR THE PROSECUTION. THE DEFENSE HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO CROSS EXAMINE THAT WITNESS. YET, WE EXPECT THAT TOMORROW. WE HEARD A LOT OF THE SAME EMOTIONAL TESTIMONY WE HEARD IN JENNIFER'S CASE, INCLUDING FROM THE TEACHER SHOT IN THE ARM. SHE RETOLD HER STORY FOR THIS JURY AND HERE'S PART OF HOW THAT WENT. WE'RE HAVING SOME DIFFICULTY. WE'RE HAVING SOME DIFFICULTY WITH THAT SOUND AN EMOTIONAL MORNING ONCE AGAIN IN THIS CASE, RIGHT SIMILAR TO WHAT WE HEARD IN JENNIFER'S CASE. AND AGAIN NOW WE'RE WAITING TO SEE WHERE THE PROSECUTION GOES FROM HERE. A LOT OF THOSE SAME WITNESSES EXPECTED, WITH THAT KEY QUESTION HANGING OVER THE DEFENSE: DO YOU PUT THE DAD ON THE STAND? A TACTIC THAT DID NOT SEEM TO WORK IN HIS WIFE'S CASE LAST MONTH HALLIE >>. MAGGIE VESPA, LIVE FOR US IN THE PONTIAC. WE'RE GLAD YOU'RE THERE BRINGING US THAT REPORTING, THANK YOU. >>>. 10 MILLION PEOPLE IN ALABAMA AND GEORGIA UNDER FLOOD, WATCHES ON THE HEELS OF A LOT OF RAIN JUST IN THESE LAST 24 HOURS LEAVING ROADS FLOODED HERE IN ATLANTA LEAVING CARS STUCK AND SOME DUCKS DUCKING. NINE PEOPLE ARE BRACING FOR HAIL. A TON OF WIND, MAYBE EVEN TORNADOES. THE DUCKS LIKE IT WHEN IT RAINS. THIS MUCH RAIN FOR FOLKS IN THE SOUTH CAN GET TO BE POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS. TALK US, THROUGH IT. >>. YEAH, I NEVER LIKE IT WHEN WE HAVE A FLOOD EVENT FORECASTED. RIGHT AFTER WE JUST HAD A FLOOD. YOU SAW THE PICTURES THERE IN THE ATLANTA AREA, YOU KNOW. THE GROUND IS SATURATED, THE RIVERS ARE UP. IT DOESN'T TAKE AS MUCH RAIN TO GET EXTREME FLOODING. THAT'S GOING TO BE TOMORROW. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE IMMEDIATE THREAT HAPPENING NOW. WE HAVE SEVERE THUNDERSTORM WATCHES THAT HAVE BEEN POSTED FROM KANSAS ALL THE WAY TO OKLAHOMA CITY. WICHITA FALLS DOES NOT INCLUDE THE DALLAS- FORT WORTH AREA. THESE WATCHES WILL GO TO 9- 10:00.. WE MAY GET A TORNADO WATCH DURING THE OVERFIGHT HOURS IN CENTRAL TEXAS. HERE'S A CLOSE-UP RADAR, NOT A FUN COMMUTE: DALLAS, FORT WORTH, NORTHWARD, IT IS JUST POURING. NO FLASH FLOOD WARNINGS OR ANYTHING. THERE'S A THUNDERSTORM WARNING TO THE SOUTH OF GRAHAM. ANOTHER STORM HEADING TOWARD BLACKWELL. LARGE HAIL IS THE CONCERN ABOUT THE NEXT FOUR TO FIVE HOURS. THEN, DURING THE OVERNIGHT, WE'LL START TO INTRODUCE THE CHANCE OF A FEW TORNADOES. THIS IS THE AREA AT RISK: THE EXACT SAME SPOTS WHERE WE HAD THE WATCHES. THIS IS THE AREA. IF WE GET TORNADOES, IT WOULD HAPPEN 3:00 AM TO 6:00 AM. SO DEAD OF THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT TOWARD THE EARLY MORNING. THIS IS AREAS JUST SOUTH OF FORT WORTH. TOMORROW WE TAKE THIS THREAT TO THE SOUTHEAST ALL FROM DALLAS TO AREAS OF ALABAMA. THERE'S YOUR FLOOD WATCH. FRIDAY EVENING, HALLIE, THREE DAYS IN A ROW, TRACKING SEVERE WEATHER AND FLASH, FLOODING THROUGH THE SOUTH. >>. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >>> COMING UP MORE TO GET TO ON THE SHOW, INCLUDING NEW DETAILS. TONIGHT ON THE BIGGEST WILDFIRE IN TEXAS HISTORY, WHAT OFFICIALS NOW SAY MIGHT HAVE STARTED IT PLUS HOW THE FDA IS EXPANDING ITS INVESTIGATION INTO CINNAMON PRODUCTS TAINTED WITH LEAD. >>> TO SOME DEVELOPING HEALTH. >>> TO SOME DEVELOPING HEALTH NEWS. TODAY, MORE KIDS ENDING UP IN EMERGENCY ROOMS. WHY THEY'RE ACCIDENTALLY OVERDOSING ON MELATONIN TURNS OUT. KIDS ARE FINDING THEIR PARENTS GUMMIES THAT HAVE MELATONIN IN THEM. THE CDC IS SAYING ER VISITS FOR BABIES AND LITTLE KIDS WHO INGESTED MELATONIN WENT UP 400% BETWEEN 2009 AND 2020.. AND THE STUDY SPECIFICALLY POINTS TO THOSE GUMMIES YOU SEE SIMILAR TO THE ONES HERE AND TO CHEWABLE TABLETS BEING APPEALING TO LITTLE KIDS. THE STUDY ALSO POINTS OUT MELATONIN SUPPLEMENTS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO HAVE CHILD RESISTANT CAPS. DID YOU KNOW THAT IS THE REASON WE'RE SEEING A SPIKE IN THIS IS BECAUSE MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE TAKING MELATONIN GENERALLY AND THESE GUMMIES ARE IN MORE HOUSEHOLDS >>. I THINK THAT'S A BIG PART OF IT. YOU HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD IN THE INTRO. THESE SUPPLEMENTS- OVER HALF OF THESE ER VISITS WERE FROM GUMMIES. TO BE FAIR, THESE THINGS ARE BECOMING VERY APPETIZING TO CHILDREN. THEY CAN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS AND SOMETHING THAT LOOKS LIKE SOUR SKITTLES. HALLIE TO THE POINT YOU BROUGHT UP EARLIER. THEY'RE NOT REQUIRED TO HAVE CHILD RESISTANT PACKAGING OR CHILD PROOF TOPS. THE ONES YOU HAVE TO HOLD AND PUSH DOWN TO THE SIDE ARE NOT REQUIRED BY MELATONIN MANUFACTURERS. HALLIE SOME NUMBERS HERE. UP 36% OF ALL CASES INVOLVE 10 OR MORE GUMMIES. MOST COME IN ABOUT FIVE MILLIGRAM DOSES. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 50 MILLIGRAMS OF MELATONIN. YOU SHOULDN'T GO MORE THAN THREE TO SIX IN A CHILD'S CASE. HERE >>. IS THERE ANYTHING PARENTS CAN TAKE? YOU KNOW, I KNOW, JUST AS A PARENT MYSELF. I KNOW SOME PARENTS AND THEY DO IT ON THE ADVICE OF PEDIATRICIAN, GIVING THEIR KIDS SMALL AMOUNTS OF MELATONIN. WHAT WOULD YOU RECOMMEND FOR KIDS AND PARENTS WHO HAVE TROUBLE SLEEPING? >>? THERE'S NO FDA APPROVED MEDICATION FOR INSOMNIA IN CHILDREN. IF I WERE A PARENT GIVING ADVICE TO A PARENT, YOU DON'T WANT SOMEBODY TO FORM, HABIT-, FORMING THINGS OR FEEL LIKE. THEY NEED SOMETHING TO GO TO SLEEP, ESPECIALLY AT THAT YOUNG OF AN AGE. WE RECOMMEND BEHAVIORAL MEDICATION: PUTTING AWAY THE SCREENS, TURNING OFF THE BLUE LIGHT, SETTING A REGULAR SLEEP SCHEDULE AND, IF YOU HAVE TO USE MELATONIN. IT'S NOT A SLEEPING PILL. IT'S SOMETHING YOU CAN USE IN THE SHORT TERM TO GET ADJUSTED. BUT IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU WANT TO BE DEPENDENT ON, ESPECIALLY AT A YOUNG AGE >>>. LET'S GET YOU TO THE FIVE THINGS OUR TEAM THINKS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THE MAN BEHIND LAST YEAR'S MASS SHOOTING IN MAINE SUFFERED TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURIES WHICH MAY HAVE INFLUENCED HIS ACTIONS. HE WAS EVENTUALLY FOUND DEAD DAYS LATER. HIS FAMILY APOLOGIZED FOR THE ATTACK. HOPING RELEASING THESE FINDINGS MAY HELP PREVENT FUTURE TRAGEDIES. TEXAS, ANNOUNCING POWER LINES, IGNITED THE BIGGEST WILDFIRE IN THE STATE'S HISTORY. WE TALKED ABOUT THE SMOKEHOUSE CREEK FIRE THAT BURNED THROUGH MORE THAN A MILLION ACRES. IT'S 74% CONTAINED. THESE FINDINGS COME HOURS AFTER. A UTILITY COMPANY SAID. ONE OF ITS FACILITIES MAY HAVE BEEN PART OF WHAT STARTED THE FIRE. THEY DENY ANY NEGLIGENCE. GROUND CINNAMON MAY BE CONTAMINATED WITH LEAD. THERE'S A LIST OF WHICH BRANDS ARE AFFECTED. THE AGENCY SAYS: IF YOU HAVE ANY OF THEM, THROW THEM AWAY, AND IF YOU'RE LIKE. I JUST REMEMBER HEARING ABOUT CINNAMON AND LEAD- IT WAS THE CINNAMON APPLESAUCE POUCHES TAINTED WITH LEAD NUMBER FOUR. IF YOUR DREAM RESTAURANT IS AN APPLEBEE'S AND AN IHOP UNDER ONE ROOF- PANCAKES AND RIBLETS TOGETHER AT LAST- GREAT NEWS FOR YOU: IT'S HAPPENING. APPARENTLY. DUAL-BRANDED LOCATIONS OPENING. SO-CALLED PROTOTYPE LOCATIONS ARE OPENING AROUND THE WORLD. THEY'LL EVENTUALLY COME TO THE. THEY'LL EVENTUALLY COME TO THE US. THE IDEA IS TO COMBINE APPLEBEE'S AND I HOP, NUMBER FIVE. 29-YEAR-OLD COLE BRAUER RACED NONSTOP AROUND THE WORLD BY HERSELF. SHE WAS GREETED BY A CHEERING CROWD OF FAMILY AND FRIENDS WAITING FOR HER ON SHORE TODAY IN SPAIN. THE SAILING TRIP TOOK 130 DAYS, COVERING 30,000 MILES- AMAZING >>>. WHEN WE COME BACK IN JUST THE NEXT FEW HOURS, YOU KNOW IT. WE ARE NOW JUST WHAT THREE AND A HALF HOURS AWAY FROM PRESIDENT BIDEN'S STATE OF THE UNION. WE'RE ABOUT TO GO ONE ON ONE WITH A MEMBER OF LEADERSHIP ON WHAT SHE'D LIKE TO HEAR >>>. NBC NEWS COVERS HUNDREDS OF >>>. NBC NEWS COVERS HUNDREDS OF STORIES EVERY DAY, BECAUSE IT CAN BE TOUGH TO READ OR WATCH OR LISTEN TO THEM. ALL OUR TEAMS IN THE BUREAUS HAVE DONE IT FOR YOU. THIS IS WHAT THEY TELL US IS GOING ON IN THEIR REGION IN A SEGMENT. WE CALL THE LOCAL. THE ARMORER ON THE MOVIE RUST GETS SENTENCED JUST YESTERDAY. THAT'S HER MOM RIGHT THERE. EXCUSE ME, GET CONVICTED SHE WILL BE SENTENCED SOON. A JURY FOUND HANNAH GUTIERREZ- REED GUILTY IN AN ON-SET SHOOTING DEATH OF THE SET'S CINEMATOGRAPHER. SHE FACES UP TO 18 MONTHS IN PRISON. A PAIR OF COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES IN FLORIDA RACING TO SAVE TWO PEOPLE TRAPPED IN A CAR UNDERWATER. ONE DEPUTY PULLS SOMEBODY OUT AND STARTS GIVING LIFE-SAVING CPR. IT IS VERY INTENSE TO WATCH INCREDIBLY BOTH PEOPLE IN THE CAR SURVIVED. THANKS TO THOSE HEROES. OUT OF OUR SOUTHERN BUREAU, A RECYCLING PLANT UP IN FLAMES. THIS IS IN ROCKY MOUNT, STILL BURNING EVEN. AS OF THIS AFTERNOON, AFTER BEING REPORTED LAST NIGHT, YOU CAN SEE THE FLAMES THERE. YOU CAN SEE CREWS TRYING TO PUT IT OUT, NOT CLEAR, YET IF ANYBODY WAS HURT >>> THE STATE OF THE UNION. NOW, JUST ABOUT THREE HOURS AWAY, I WANT TO BRING IN SOMEBODY. WHO'S WANT TO BRING IN SOMEBODY. WHO'S GOING TO BRING IN THE HOUSE CHAMBER CONGRESSWOMAN CATHERINE KATHRYN CLARK. >>. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. >>. IT IS A BIG NIGHT, IT IS A BUSY NIGHT, AND PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS A LOT ON THE LINE HERE: AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET HIS MESSAGE OUT TO MILLIONS OF AMERICANS IN WHAT IS A VERY BUSY WEEK. WE'RE FRESH OFF SUPER TUESDAY. WHAT DOES THE PRESIDENT NEED TO SAY TONIGHT? WHAT DO YOU WANT TO HEAR FROM HIM? >>. Reporter, I THINK WHAT WE ARE GOING TO HEAR FROM THE PRESIDENT IS THAT HE IS ABOUT THE FORWARD PROGRESS, BUILDING ON THE PROGRESS HE HAS ALREADY MADE ALL THE WORK HE HAS DONE AND STANDING STRONG IN THE CONTRAST WITH DONALD TRUMP, WHO WANTS TO TAKE US BACKWARDS. I AM EXCITED. I KNOW ALSO THAT IT IS GOING TO BE ROOTED IN REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM, WHICH IS ONE OF THE HIGHEST CONTRASTS, AND I AM SO GRATEFUL TO PRESIDENT BIDEN FOR HIS LEADERSHIP. WHEN WE ARE REALLY AT A CROSSROADS IN THIS COUNTRY ON, ARE WE GOING TO GO FORWARD AS A DEMOCRACY? ARE WE GOING TO PROCEED WITH EQUALITY FOR WOMEN? >>. YOU MENTIONED OBVIOUSLY THE ISSUE OF REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS. WE KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING. DEMOCRATS WILL BE MOBILIZING FOR VOTERS COME NOVEMBER. IT RELATES TO YOUR GUEST TONIGHT, A WOMAN FROM TEXAS TALK US THROUGH THE MESSAGE THAT YOU'RE HOPING TO SEND WITH YOUR GUESTS. ESPECIALLY, WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHO THE BIGGEST ISSUES TO AMERICANS MORE BROADLY, IT'S ECONOMY, IT'S IMMIGRATION NUMBER ONE IS NOT REPRODUCTIVE ACCESS. HOW DO YOU SEE THAT PLAYING INTO NOVEMBER? >>. OH, REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM IS ABSOLUTELY GOING TO BE A TOP ISSUE FOR 2024.. AND I'M SO HONORED AND PRIVILEGED TO HAVE AMANDA AS MY GUEST. SHE IS THE LEAD PLAINTIFF IN THE CASE AGAINST TEXAS AND HER. THE CASE AGAINST TEXAS AND HER STORY AND MY STORY ARE A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF PRE-DOBBS AND POST-DOBBS. WHEN I NEEDED AN ABORTION TO PREVENT INFECTION. I GOT IT FROM MY DOCTOR AND I GOT THE CARE I NEEDED IMMEDIATELY. THEN WE GO POST-DOBBS AND AMANDA, WHO WAS SIX MONTHS PREGNANT, HER WATER BROKE, HER BABY WAS NOT GOING TO SURVIVE BUT INSTEAD OF BEING ABLE TO ACCESS THE CARE SHE NEEDED, SHE WAS TOLD TO GO HOME AND WAIT, UNTIL INFECTION SET IN AND IT DID AND SHE'S SPENT DAYS IN THE ICU BARELY HANGING ON TO HER LIFE. AND NOW HER ROAD TO MOTHERHOOD CONTINUES TO BE THROUGH. FERTILITY TREATMENT, IVF, AND WHAT SHE IS TERRIFIED OF IS THE ALABAMA DECISION, BECAUSE THE EXTREMISTS IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY ARE NOT NOW ONLY SAYING IF AND WHEN WOMEN AND FAMILIES CAN HAVE CHILDREN, BUT HOW, AND SO HER STORY RESONATES WITH AMERICANS, AND AMERICAN WOMEN ACROSS THIS COUNTRY, BUT ESPECIALLY FOR THE 21 MILLION WOMEN WHO ARE LIVING IN STATES THAT HAVE BANNED THIS ESSENTIAL HEALTHCARE >>. OBVIOUSLY THE COTON. VERY ABLE RULING IN ALABAMA. PUTTING ABLE RULING IN ALABAMA, PUTTING A SPOTLIGHT ON THE ISSUE OF REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS. YET, CONGRESSWOMAN, YOU KNOW WHAT PRESIDENT BIDEN'S APPROVAL RATING IS. IT IS 37%. THAT IS LOWER THAN FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP IN HIS LAST STATE OF THE UNION, LOWER THAN FORMER PRESIDENT OBAMA IN 2012,. LOWER THAN FORMER PRESIDENT BUSH AND LOWER THAN FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON. IT'S NOT GOOD. IT'S NOT WHERE. I ASSUME BIDEN WOULD LIKE IT TO BE. WHAT DOES HE NEED TO DO TO TURN THAT AROUND? DOES HE HAVE CONCERNS? HE'S NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO RESONATE WITH VOTERS COME THE FALL? >> ABSOLUTELY NOT. I AM ENTHUSIASTICALLY ENDORSING PRESIDENT BIDEN BECAUSE OF WHAT HE HAS ACCOMPLISHED WHEN WE GO FROM THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN AND PULLING US OUT OF THE PANDEMIC, TO THE INFRASTRUCTURE LAW, TO THE FIRST GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION BILL IN 30 YEARS, TO BRINGING MANUFACTURING BACK TO OUR SHORES THROUGH THE SHIPS AND SCIENCE ACT, REDUCING THE COST OF HEALTHCARE, CAPPING INULIN AT $35 A MONTH, REDUCING PREMIUMS IN THE ACA AND A HISTORIC INVESTMENT IN BUILDING RESILIENCY IN OUR COUNTRY, TO CLIMATE CHANGE. BUT HE KNOWS THE JOB IS NOT DONE. HE KNOWS THAT FAMILIES ARE STILL STRUGGLING AND THE WORK AND THE VISION HE HAS FOR THE FUTURE, FOR HIS SECOND TERM, IS IN LINE WITH WHAT I HEAR FROM FAMILIES ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY, AND THAT IS THAT WE NEED: TO FOCUS ON THOSE CONTINUED LOWERING COSTS, WHETHER IT'S CHILDCARE OR GROCERIES, OR ADDRESSING OUR HOUSING CRISIS. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM THE PRESIDENT TONIGHT >>. THE OTHER THING WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM PRESIDENT WE KNOW IS THAT HE IS WIDELY EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE A NEW PORT OFF THE COAST OF THE GAZA STRIP TO BRING MORE HUMANITARIAN HELP TO PEOPLE WHO NEED IT- THE CIVILIANS, THE INNOCENT PEOPLE IN GAZA. THE WAY THE WHITE HOUSE HAS HANDLED THIS WAR IS SOMETHING PROGRESSIVES HAVE BEEN UPSET OVER. WE'VE SEEN ACTIVISTS REPEATEDLY CONFRONTING THE PRESIDENT ON THIS. DO YOU THINK THAT COULD HAPPEN TONIGHT? >>. WHAT WE HAVE HEARD FROM THE PRESIDENT AND THE VICE PRESIDENT OVER THE LAST WEEK IS ONE THAT IS EXACTLY WHERE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE. WE STAND WITH ISRAELIS AND OUR ALLY IN ISRAEL BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT WE HAVE A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN GAZA, AND THE PRESIDENT HAS STARTED DOING AIR DROPS OF HUMANITARIAN RELIEF BUT WE KNOW THAT'S NOT ENOUGH. SO BUILDING THIS PIER BEING ABLE TO BRING IN THE AID THAT IS DESPERATELY NEEDED IMMEDIATELY, IS A CRITICAL STEP IN ADDRESSING THE DEATH AND DESTRUCTION THAT WE ARE SEEING IN GAZA. SO THE PRESIDENT CONTINUES TO CALL FOR A CEASEFIRE TO BE AT THAT NEGOTIATING TABLE, TO BE PUSHING FOR PEACE IN THIS REGION WHILE MEETING THE NEEDS OF GAZANS, AND HE IS ALSO, AT THE SAME TIME, SETTING THE STAGE ACROSS THE REGION FOR THE DAY AFTER- AND HOW WE TRULY BRING A SOLUTION AND MAKE SURE BOTH PALESTINIANS AND ISRAELIS HAVE THE SECURITY THEY DESERVE. >>. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING WITH US. WE'RE GLAD TO HAVE YOU. WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME ON A BUSY NIGHT >>>, TALKING ABOUT THE ISRAEL HAMAS WAR, AND YOU KNOW THAT'S GOING TO BE FRONT AND CENTER, WITH MORE THAN A DOZEN FAMILY MEMBERS OF HAMAS-HELD HOSTAGES IN THE AUDIENCE AS GUESTS, AS MEMBERS OF CONGRESS. AND THEN, OF COURSE, WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT THE PLAN THAT THE PRESIDENT IS EXPECTED TO ROLL OUT, ABOUT THAT NEW PORT ON THE COASTLINE SO SHIPS CAN GET AID DIRECTLY TO FOLKS THERE. ALL OF IT OF COURSE RELATED TO THAT HUMANITARIAN CRISIS. AND ON THE HEELS OF THE US AIR DROPPING FOOD, MEDICINE AND SUPPLIES INTO GAZA. STARTING JUST A FEW DAYS AGO, IT'S HAPPENING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH JORDAN. RICHARD ENGLE JOINED THE JORDANIAN AIR FORCE FOR ONE OF THOSE MISSIONS. HE'S GOT THIS REPORT >>. Reporter. WE JUST FINISHED ACCOMPANYING AN AID DROP THAT LEFT FROM HERE IN JORDAN, FROM THIS MILITARY BASE ON THIS PLANE, AND DROPPED HUMANITARIAN SUPPLIES INTO THE GAZA STRIP. THIS ONE WENT TO NORTHERN GAZA, WHICH IS THE HARDEST HIT AREA, WHERE THE HUNGER IS AT ITS MOST SEVERE. LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT WHAT WE SAW AND HOW IT WORKS. THIS PLANE WAS ABLE TO HOLD ROUGHLY 25,000 MEALS. THESE ARE SUPPLIES DONATED BY THE JORDANIAN GOVERNMENT IN THIS CASE, BUT THERE ARE ALSO SUPPLIES DONATED FROM CHARITIES FROM THE UNITED STATES, FROM THE UN AND IT'S A VERY SIMPLE, OLD-FASHIONED KIND OF MECHANISM. THE PALETTES ARE ATTACHED TO A BIG SLED, AND ON TOP OF THE PALETTES ARE PARACHUTES, AND WHEN YOU GET OVER GAZA, THE CREW OPENS THIS BACK DOOR AND THE PALETTES SIMPLY SLIDE OFF AND FLOAT DOWN TO THE PEOPLE OF GAZA. NOW, GAZA'S NOT VERY FAR FROM HERE, BUT THIS TOOK A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF TIME, BECAUSE EVERY STEP OF THIS PROCESS WAS COORDINATED WITH THE ISRAELI MILITARY. AND AS WE WERE FLYING OVER, AND EVEN BEFORE WE GOT TO ISRAELI AIR SPACE, THE JORDANIANS WERE TALKING TO THE ISRAELIS, DECONFLICTING IT, AND THEN, WHEN WE ENTERED GAZA ITSELF, THERE WASN'T A TRUE EFFORT TO CREATE A CEASEFIRE, BUT THEY WERE DECONFLICTING THE MILITARY SO THAT THE PLANE WLDN'T GET SHOT DOWN, BECAUSE THE ISRAELIS DON'T WANT TO SHOOT DOWN A JORDANIAN PLANE. JORDAN IS AN ALLY OF ISRAEL, HAS A PEACE TREATY WITH ISRAEL, AND THERE'S A LOT OF ATTENTION AND SENSITIVITY ABOUT THESE MISSIONS. RIGHT NOW. SO IT WAS COORDINATED, IT TOOK HOURS AND IT IS VERY, VERY SLOW. AID AGENCIES WILL TELL YOU. THIS IS ALL HELPFUL. THE PEOPLE OF GAZA NEED ASSISTANCE, BUT THIS IS A DROP IN THE BUCKET. YOU CAN'T MEET THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE OF GAZA DROPPING PALETTES OF FOOD, ONE AT A TIME. IT'S HELPFUL, BUT NOT A SOLUTION. >>. OUR THANKS TO RICHARD ENGLE FOR THAT REPORTING. >>>. COME UP, STEPPED UP, SECURITY IN ONE OF THE BIGGEST TRANSIT SYSTEMS IN THE NORTHEAST: THE CRIME PROMPTING THOSE >>>. FOR THE FIRST DAY TODAY >>> FOR THE FIRST DAY TODAY, WE'RE SEEING HUNDREDS OF NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS PATROLLING THE NEW YORK CITY SUBWAY, 750 IN ALL, PLUS 250 OFFICERS FROM STATE AND MTA LOOK AT THAT. AFTER A SERIES OF HIGH-PROFILE ATTACKS, THE NATIONAL GUARD SET TO DO THINGS LIKE RANDOM BAG CHECKS AT ANOTHER METRO SYSTEM. A BIT FURTHER, SOUTH POLICE IN PHILADELPHIA ARE LOOKING FOR THE SUSPECTS ACCUSED OF SHOOTING EIGHTEENS ON A PUBLIC BUS. GEORGE SCALISE IS JOINING US NOW. THESE TEENAGERS WERE GETTING ON THIS BUS NEAR PHILLY >>. Reporter. THE INVESTIGATION VERY MUCH UNDER WAY. POLICE RELEASING SURVEILLANCE VIDEO CAPTURING THE HARROWING MOMENTS BEFORE THAT HAIL OF GUNFIRE ERUPTED. WHAT YOU SEE IS THREE SUSPECTS GETTING OUT OF A BLUE HYUNDAI, AS DESCRIBED BY POLICE, AND THEY RUN UP TO THIS BUS STOP. THAT IS FREQUENTED BY HIGH SCHOOLERS. 30 SHOTS OR SO WERE FIRED. WE HAVE LEARNED FROM POLICE THAT WAS A STOLEN CAR. THEY ARE LOOKING FOR THE FOURTH PERSON, THE DRIVER IN THE VEHICLE. THEY ARE LOOKING TO SEE IF THIS SHOOTING MAY BE CONNECTED TO ANOTHER SHOOTING THAT HAPPENED EARLIER THIS WEEK, THAT ALSO INVOLVED TEENAGERS. YES, THIS HAIL OF GUNFIRE INJURING THOSE EIGHTEENS, BRINGING THE FULL TOTAL OF JUVENILES INJURED IN THIS CITY TO 11.. THAT IS A STAGGERING FIGURE. THAT HAS PROMPTED A RESPONSE FROM THE ATF AND FROM THE MAYOR, THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY, THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE DISTRICT OF PHILADELPHIA. EVERYONE IS WEIGHING IN SAYING THIS VIOLENCE IS COMPLETELY OUT OF HAND AND THEY NEED TO DO SOMETHING. THEY'RE CALLING ON PARENTS EVEN TO DO THOSE BAG CHECKS, TO DO CHECKS OF BEDROOMS FOR ANY OF THESE WEAPONS THAT MAY BE CIRCLING THESE STREETS, TO PREVENT ANOTHER SHOOTING LIKE THIS HAPPENING. ONE OF THE PEOPLE THAT WAS SHOT YESTERDAY, HALLIE, ABOUT NINE TIMES FROM WHAT POLICE TOLD US TODAY. THEY'RE NOT SURE IF THIS TEEN WAS TARGETED, BUT GIVEN SOME OF THE LIKELIHOOD AND SOME OF THE THINGS. THEY ARE STARTING TO ACCIDENTAL MELATONIN OVERDOSES IN LITTLE KIDS. THAT'S LATER ON IN THE SHOW >>>. I'M HALLIE EVEN THOUGH. YOU PROBABLY DON'T REMEMBER MOST OF THE STATE OF THE UNION SPEECHES YOU'VE WATCHED, IF YOU'VE EVEN WATCHED THEM AT ALL. THIS YEAR IS DIFFERENT. IT MIGHT BE A DIFFERENCE MAKER FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN AS HE FIGHTS FOR HIS POLITICAL LIFE THIS YEAR. I'M LOOKING AT MY CLOCK. IN THE LAST TWO MINUTES WE ARE GETTING THE FIRST GLIMPSE OF WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO STAY. TONIGHT, THE PRESIDENT TACKLING THE ISSUE OF HIS AGE HEAD ON HERE'S ONE EXCERPT WE ARE GETTING. TONIGHT HE IS EXPECTED TO SAY: MY LIFETIME HAS TAUGHT ME TO EMBRACE FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY, A FUTURE BASED ON THE CORE VALUES THAT HAVE DEFINED AMERICA: HONESTY, DECENCY, DIGNITY, EQUALITY. HE WANTS TO SHOW THE COUNTRY THAT 81 IS JUST A NUMBER AND THAT THE NUMBER THEY SHOULD BE LOOKING AT IS FOUR, AS IN THAT MANY MORE YEARS IN THE WHITE HOUSE HE'S MAKING A REFERENCE TO FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP. I MEAN LISTEN. HE HAS TO TALK ABOUT THE AGE. HE'S GOT TO TALK ABOUT THE AGE THING BECAUSE A LOT OF AMERICANS HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF PEOPLE THINK THE PRESIDENT'S TOO OLD TO BE EFFECTIVE. HIS OPPONENT, FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP, WANTS PEOPLE TO THINK THAT EVEN THOUGH. THEY'RE ONLY FOUR YEARS APART AND WE SEE THE PRESIDENT KIND OF REFERENCING THAT, SAYING NOW, SOME OTHER PEOPLE- MY AGE- SEE A DIFFERENT STORY, AN AMERICAN STORY OF RESENTMENT, REVENGE AND RETRIBUTION. THAT'S NOT ME WORDS. DONALD TRUMP ARE NOT IN THERE. THE IMPLICATION SEEMS TO BE CLEAR. WE KNOW THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN IS GOING TO TALK ABOUT OTHER KEY ISSUES: THE ECONOMY, CLIMATE CHANGE, ETC. THE BACKDROP POLLS SHOWING IMMIGRATION AT AS THE TOP ISSUE FOR A LOT OF AMERICANS RIGHT NOW. WATCH FOR THE PRESIDENT TO TRY TO FLIP THE SCRIPT AND PUT REPUBLICANS ON DEFENSE EVEN AS REPUBLICANS ACCUSE THE PRESIDENT OF FAILING TO DO HIS JOB ON THAT, HOW'S HE GOING TO ADDRESS IT? NO PLAN TO ROLL OUT SOME NEW EXECUTIVE ACTION. NEXT QUESTION: WHAT ABOUT A VIBE CHECK ON THE ECONOMY? THE NUMBERS ARE LOOKING BETTER. EVEN WITH THE MARKETS HITTING RECORD HIGHS TODAY, PEOPLE ARE NOT FEELING BETTER. HOW CAN THE PRESIDENT GET THEM THERE NEWS WE DO EXPECT. OUR SOURCES SAY HE'S GOING TO ROLL OUT A NEW PLAN TO BUILD A PORT IN GAZA. IS THAT GOING TO QUIET? IS CRITICS INCLUDING IN HIS OWN PARTY, WHO WANT HIM TO DO MORE FOR A CEASEFIRE? IT'S A LOT. OUR TEAM OF REPORTERS IS ALL OVER IT, INCLUDING CHRISTINE ROMANS ON THE ECONOMY, JULIA AINSLEY ON THE BORDER. AND LET ME START AT THE WHITE HOUSE, WHERE KELLY O'DONNELL IS POSTED UP. >>. Reporter. THIS IS A WAY FOR THE WHITE HOUSE TO GIVE A LITTLE TASTE OF WHAT THE PRESIDENT WILL SAY TONIGHT AND THEN THE MAIN EVENT IS AT 9:00 PM AND THEY HAVE GIVEN US ALSO A SELECTION. THAT DEALS WITH ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT DEMOCRATS AND THE WHITE HOUSE DEFINITELY BELIEVE WILL DRIVE VOTERS, AND THAT IS ABORTION RIGHTS. WE EXPECT THE PRESIDENT WILL SAY THAT CLEARLY. THOSE BRAGGING RIGHTS ABOUT OVERTURNING ROE V WADE, WHICH IS AN INFERENCE TO FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP, HAVE NO CLUE ABOUT THE POWER OF WOMEN IN AMERICA. IF AMERICANS SEND ME A CONGRESS, THAT SUPPORTS THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE. I PROMISE YOU, SAYS PRESIDENT BIDEN, I WILL RESTORE ROE V WADE AS THE LAW OF THE LAND AGAIN. SO IMPLICIT IN THAT IS THE PRESIDENT TRYING TO SAY VOTERS NEED TO PUT DEMOCRATS AT LEAST IN A MAJORITY IN CHARGE, IN A NEW SENATE, A NEW HOUSE WITH THE NEXT TERM, AND THAT IF HE IS IN OFFICE, HE WOULD WORK TO RESTORE THOSE RIGHTS. THAT WILL BE A BIG THEME THEY BELIEVE IT APPLIES NOT ONLY TO DEMOCRATIC WOMEN, INDEPENDENTS AND EVEN REPUBLICANS, ESPECIALLY WOMEN REPUBLICANS- IN THE SUBURBS AND HALLIE IN THE SPIRIT OF THIS NIGHT, IF YOU HEAR ANY OF THE EXTERNAL NOISE, THERE IS A CEASEFIRE PROTEST HAPPENING IN THE PARK BEHIND ME. THAT IS VERY MUCH IN TUNE WITH WHAT HAPPENS ON A STATE OF THE UNION. NIGHT, PEOPLE WITH STRONG FEELINGS ABOUT BIG ISSUES COME TO THIS AREA OF THE WHITE HOUSE, COME TO THE CAPITOL TO LET THEIR VOICES BE KNOWN AND, AS YOU'VE INDICATED, THE PRESIDENT WILL CERTAINLY BE TALKING ABOUT WAYS TO BRING HUMANITARIAN AID TO GAZA IN HIS REMARKS TONIGHT. I'VE BEEN TOLD BY SOURCES THAT THE ISRAEL-GAZA CONFLICT WILL BE A FAIR AMOUNT OF THE FOREIGN POLICY. THAT WILL BE IN TONIGHT'S ADDRESS. >>. KELLY, THANKS WHERE HE HEAR THOSE PROTESTS BEHIND YOU. IT IS A BIG NIGHT FOR THAT. THERE'S ALSO THIS INTERESTING IDEA OF I MENTIONED WE'RE IN A BIG WEEK. WE'RE JUST 48 HOURS PAST SUPER TUESDAY, KELLY, TYPICALLY, THE STATE OF THE UNION IS THE BIGGEST THING IN POLITICS. THAT WEEK IT'S GOT SOME COMPETITION NOW AND THE BIDEN TEAM IS SAYING: THEY RAISED SOMETHING LIKE ONE AND A HALF MILLION. AFTER IT BECAME CLEAR: NIKKI HALEY WASN'T GOING TO HAVE A GOOD NIGHT >>. Reporter, AND THEY BELIEVE THAT SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE SUPPORTED NIKKI HALEY COULD BE WITHIN REACH FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN, AND HE WILL TRY TO EXTEND THAT MESSAGE. I'VE ALSO BEEN TOLD THAT TONIGHT THERE WILL BE RHETORIC THAT WILL ADDRESS SOME CONCERNS, HIM CALLING OUT OF REPUBLICANS BUT IN A WAY THAT IS CAUTIOUS, NOT ONLY BECAUSE PRESIDENT BIDEN IS SOMEONE WHO'S SORT OF STEEPED IN THE TRADITION AND THE DECORUM OF A NIGHT LIKE THIS, BUT ALSO BECAUSE HE WANTS TO BE CLEAR ABOUT CHOICES, WITHOUT ALIENATING REPUBLICANS WHO MIGHT BE PERSUADABLE TO COME TO HIS SIDE OVER THE MONTHS AHEAD AND TRYING TO TALK ABOUT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HIMSELF AND DONALD TRUMP, AS YOU INDICATED IN SOME CLIPS AT THE TOP, BUT WE DON'T EXPECT HIS NAME TO BE USED, DONALD TRUMP'S NAME TO BE USED, YET EVERYONE AT THE WHITE HOUSE- IN TERMS OF SOURCES WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO SAY, IT'S NO SURPRISE WHO THE PRESIDENT WILL BE REFERRING TO, BUT IT IS A CHOICE TO NOT MAKE IT SOUND LIKE A CAMPAIGN SPEECH. EVEN THOUGH, IT IS, IN MANY WAYS, A KICK OFF TO THE CAMPAIGN FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN, WHO WILL MOST CERTAINLY WRAP HIMSELF IN CAMPAIGN RHETORIC AND ACTIVITY IN THE DAYS AND WEEKS TO COME. >>. KELLY O'DONNELL, THANK YOU MUCH. WE'LL SEE YOU, I'M SURE, A THOUSAND TIMES THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT. WE'LL ALSO SEE JULIA ABOUT A THOUSAND TIMES. THE PRESIDENT'S GOING TO TAKE THAT TWO-MILE JOURNEY DOWN PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE. LATER ON, WHEN HE GETS THERE, HE'S GOING TO BE FACING A CHAMBER FULL OF NOT JUST MEMBERS OF CONGRESS BUT SOME OF THEIR GUESTS, AS WELL WE KNOW. HE FACED HECKLING DURING THE LAST STATE OF THE UNION. HE TRIED TO USE THAT TO HIS ADVANTAGE. THE HOUSE SPEAKER IS TELLING HIS MEMBERS: LET'S FOCUS ON DECORUM TONIGHT. QUESTION IS: WILL THEY LISTEN? >>. Reporter. THIS IS NOT ONLY A NIGHT FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN, BUT THIS IS A CHANCE FOR LAWMAKERS UP HERE TO PLATFORM THEIR ISSUE, AND THEY'RE DOING SO BY INVITING THE GUESTS ON VARIOUS TOPICS, FROM ABORTION TO IVF, TO BIG TECH, TO, ALSO, THE ISRAEL AND HAMAS WAR. I TALKED TO CORY BUSH, WHO HAS BEEN LOUD, WHO HAS BEEN OUTSPOKEN IN CALLING FOR A CEASEFIRE AND PUTTING THAT PRESSURE ON THE PRESIDENT, AND SHE TELLS ME THAT PROTESTING IN THE CHAMBER IS NOT OFF THE TABLE. >>. ONE THING I THINK PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT ME IS, IF I FEEL THE NEED TO SPEAK OUT, I SPEAK OUT. ONE THING: I AM NOT. I'M NOT PERFORMATIVE IN THE WAY TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK OUT TO SAY SOMETHING, SO I DON'T KNOW. I HAVEN'T HEARD WHAT HE'S GOING TO SAY, SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT MY REACTION IS GOING TO BE. >>. Reporter. NOW BUSH IS STANDING THERE ON YOUR SCREEN AS YOU SEE HER WITH DR SOLAMA. I INTERVIEWED BOTH OF THEM. SHE'S A PALESTINIAN DENTIST. SHE LOST 35 MEMBERS WHO ARE STILL IN GAZA. SHE FEELS GUILTY BEING HERE WHILE THEY ARE OVER THERE. SHE FEELS PROUD TO BE IN THAT CHAMBER TONIGHT, SO HER VOICE IS HEARD. YOU HAVE FAMILIES OF HOSTAGES, INCLUDING THOSE BEING BROUGHT BY SPEAKER JOHNSON HIMSELF TRYING TO MAKE CHAIR CASE, AND SOLAMA AS WELL. AS CORY BUSH SAID, THAT'S IMPORTANT. THEY WANT TO HEAR FROM THE PRESIDENT OF AN IMMEDIATE AND LASTING CEASEFIRE >>. THANK YOU SO MUCH. LET ME BRING IN SENIOR BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT, CHRISTINE ROMANS, LOOKING AT ANOTHER ONE OF THE EXCERPTS FROM PRESIDENT BIDEN'S SPEECH TONIGHT, AND HE'S EXPECTED TO TALK ABOUT THE ECONOMY IT NEEDS TO WORK FROM THE MIDDLE OUT AND THE BOTTOM UP, NOT THE TOP DOWN >>. HE'S GOING TO BE POSITIONING HIMSELF AS WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON? ARE YOU ON THE SIDE OF THE BIG CORPORATIONS, RIGHT, WHO ARE RAISING PRICES, OR ON THE SIDE OF ME, WHO'S TRYING TO LOWER YOUR PRICES, LOWER YOUR COSTS AND MAKE THE TAX CODE A LITTLE FAIRER? HE'S GOING TO TRY TO FRAME HIMSELF AS THE PERSON AT THE KITCHEN TABLE WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE >>. AND YET, EVEN, WITH THE NUMBERS GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. THE NASDAQ HITTING RECORD HIGHS TODAY, INFLATION GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION OR STARTING TO UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBERS DOWN. IT'S NOT LIKE PEOPLE ARE TELLING POLLSTERS THEY LOVE HOW THE ECONOMY IS DO >>. I THINK THOSE INFLATION SCARS ARE DEEP AND THEY ARE FRESH. WHEN YOU LOOK AT GROCERY BILLS AND I KEEP TELLING YOU THIS NUMBER, BECAUSE THIS NUMBER SHOCKS ME. GROCERY PRICES SINCE JANUARY 2020 ARE UP 25%. OVERALL PRICES SINCE JANUARY 2020 ARE UP 19%. WHAT PEOPLE ARE PAYING WHEN THEY BUY STUFF EVEN THOUGH. INFLATION IS OFF OF ITS PEAK AND IS MODERATING. PRICES ARE STILL RISING MORE SLOWLY. GO AHEAD PEOPLE. LOOK AT THE PRICE THEY PAY AND IT MAKES THEM FEEL LOUSY, LIKE EVERY OTHER ECONOMIC INDICATORS. >> JANUARY 2020, THAT WAS A DIFFERENT UNIVERSE. THAT WAS JUST BEFORE THE PANDEMIC RIGHT. EVEN THOUGH INFLATION HAS BEEN TICKING DOWN SINCE SOME OF THOSE SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES GOT WORKED OUT. POST-PANDEMIC IT STILL HURTS. >> THAT VIBE SESSION YOU AND I OFTEN TALK ABOUT. THINK ABOUT WHERE WE WERE FOUR YEARS AGO. THINK ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO. RIGHT NOW WAS WHEN THE WHOLE UNIVERSE WAS SHUTTING DOWN BECAUSE OF COVID. >> MARCH 2020.. >> LOOK AT WHAT WE'VE LIVED THROUGH WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT. ARE YOU BETTER OFF TODAY THAN FOUR YEARS AGO? WHAT PEOPLE HAVE LIVED THROUGH IN THE PAST FOUR YEARS HAS BEEN TOTALLY LIFE CHANGING. MAYBE THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THE ECONOMY NUMBERS GET SUCH TERRIBLE POLLING. MAYBE THE ECONOMY NUMBERS ARE A VESSEL FOR EVERYTHING ELSE. PEOPLE WAITING FOR THE NEXT SHOE TO DROP. PEOPLE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENED OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS WONDERING IF THINGS WILL GET REALLY BACK TO NORMAL AND JUST A LITTLE MORE RISK, AVERSE AND AFRAID THAN THEY WERE, YOU KNOW, FOUR OR FIVE YEARS AGO. >> HOW ARE YOU WATCHING THIS SPEECH? >> I'M INTERESTED TO SEE WHAT HE SAYS ABOUT HOUSING AND HOUSING AFFORDABILITY. I THINK THERE WILL BE INTERESTING NUGGETS ABOUT LOWERING PRICES FOR AMERICAN FAMILIES AND MAKING AFFORDABLE HOUSING AVAILABLE TO REGULAR PEOPLE. WE'LL BE LOOKING FOR THAT. AND YOU SEE THESE OTHER THINGS. HE'S GOING TO TICK THROUGH ALL THE THINGS HE'S DONE, ONE BY ONE, TO CHIP AWAY AT UNFAIRNESS IN PRICING. HE'LL PROBABLY CALL OUT CORPORATIONS FOR NOT PASSING ALONG. THEY'RE STILL IN THE COVID ERA OF PASSING ON THEIR COSTS TO CONSUMERS. HE'S GOING TO BE ON THE SIDE OF THE CONSUMER AND SAY, HEY, THIS ISN'T FAIR. WE'RE USING THE LEVERS OF GOVERNMENT. WE HAVE TO TRY TO CALL THESE COMPANIES OUT, THESE INDUSTRIES OUT, TO MAKE SURE THERE AREN'T HIDDEN COSTS OR UNFAIR FEES. THEY'VE BEEN GOING AFTER THOSE. IT SOUNDS LIKE NICKEL AND DIMING, BUT THE WHITE HOUSE THINKS THE PEOPLE FEEL ALL OF THESE COSTS AND THEY NEED TO SHOW LOOK. WE FEEL YOUR PAIN. >>. CHRISTINE ROMANS, WE HAVE COFFEE HERE FOR YOU. WE HAVE DINNER. COME BACK FOR OUR SPECIAL COVERAGE IN A COUPLE HOURS. THANK YOU, CHRISTINE. GOOD TO SEE YOU. LET'S GET TO JULIA AINSLEY, WHO IS LIVE FOR US. IN TEXAS, PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS BEEN UNDER FIRE FROM REPUBLICANS FOR THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS ALONG THE BORDER. HE IS HOPING TO FLIP THE SCRIPT ON THAT AND POINT TO CONGRESS AND SAY: WAIT A SECOND, YOU DIDN'T ACTUALLY DO ANYTHING ON THE BILL WE HAD IN PLACE THAT WOULD HAVE ADDRESSED THIS >>. Reporter. YEAH HALLIE, I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HEAR MORE FROM THE PRESIDENT TONIGHT ON IMMIGRATION THAN WE MIGHT HAVE HEARD IN PREVIOUS STATE OF THE UNIONS. IMMIGRATION IS BECOMING SUCH A KEY ISSUE FOR A LOT OF VOTERS- THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE FOR A LOT OF VOTERS. THIS WASN'T EVEN ON THEIR TOP FIVE OR 10 BEFORE YOU SAW THESE NUMBERS THAT HAVE REALLY RISEN IN RECENT YEARS. PART OF THAT COMING AFTER THE PANDEMIC SOME OF THOSE RESTRICTIONS LOOSENED ON THE BORDER. A LOT OF IT HAS TO DO WITH WHAT'S GOING ON GLOBALLY. THERE'S A LOT OF POVERTY AND CIVIL UNREST. IN CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA. WE SEE MORE MIGRANTS COME FROM COUNTRIES LIKE VENEZUELA THAT CAN'T BE DEPORTED. THAT'S BEEN PUT ON THE DOORSTEP OF THE PRESIDENT, WHO USED TO NOT TALK A LOT ABOUT THIS ISSUE, BECAUSE THE REPUBLICANS CAN FIRE UP THEIR BASE TO GET TO THE POLLS OFTENTIMES. FOR DEMOCRATS, IT DIDN'T DO THEM A LOT OF FAVORS TO TALK ABOUT IT BUT THE PRESIDENT HAS DONE A LOT OF EXECUTIVE ACTION ON THE BORDER, MORE SO IN HIS FIRST TERM THAN PRESIDENT TRUMP DID, WHICH IS HARD TO THINK ABOUT WHEN YOU QUANTIFY THEM. THERE HAVE BEEN SO MANY. SOME OF THEM HAVE ALLOWED IMMIGRATION, ICE IMMIGRATION, TO PRIORITIZE WHO GETS ARRESTED AND WHO IS GOING TO BE DETAINED. OTHERS HAVE MADE IT A LOT TOUGHER FOR MIGRANTS TO TRY TO RAISE THE BAR ON ASYLUM, TO TRY TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO APPLY FOR LAWFUL PATHWAYS ON THEIR WAY TO THE US, RATHER THAN CROSSING THE BORDER ILLEGALLY BUT HE CONTINUES TO GET PUSH BACK BECAUSE OF THE NUMBERS AT BORDER. ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE DROPPED PRETTY PRECIPITOUSLY SINCE LAST YEAR, A BIG WAY. WE'VE SEEN HOW THIS WHITE HOUSE IS THINKING ABOUT IMMIGRATION AND WE'LL SEE THIS TONIGHT IS THE FACT THAT THE PRESIDENT DID NOT ANNOUNCE AN EXECUTIVE ACTION ON IMMIGRATION BETWEEN THAT BORDER SECURITY PIECE OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY SUPPLEMENTAL BEING STRIPPED OUT BECAUSE REPUBLICANS BLOCKED IT AND THE STATE OF THE UNION. TONIGHT HE COULD HAVE TAKEN EXECUTIVE ACTION BUT IT WAS SEEN INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE THAT COULD HAVE THEM LOSE. THE NARRATIVE REPUBLICANS COULD SAY: BIDEN HAD THE POWER TO DO THIS ALL ALONG. THE POWER TO DO THIS ALL ALONG. WHY DID THEY NEED US? WE MAY SEE SOME NEW ACTION. [ NO AUDIO ] >>. A LITTLE BIT OF TECHNICAL ISSUES THERE. WE DROP THAT AUDIO BUT I THINK WE GOT THE GIST OF WHAT YOU WERE SAYING. MORE OF COURSE ON THE STATE OF THE UNION LATER TONIGHT. AS OUR SPECIAL COVERAGE CONTINUES AT 8:00 EASTERN FIRST, WE HAVE TO BRING YOU BREAKING NEWS OUT OF NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE, WHERE AN ARMY SERGEANT HAS BEEN INDICTED FOR SELLING SENSITIVE MILITARY INFORMATION TO A CO-CONSPIRATOR IN CHINA. HERE'S WHAT PROSECUTORS SAID: >> A MULTI-YEAR CONSPIRACY TO ILLEGALLY EXPLOIT HIS ACCESS TO NATIONAL DEFENSE INFORMATION FOR HIS OWN FINANCIAL BENEFIT. HE TRADED OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE INFORMATION FOR CASH >>. I WANT TO BRING IN TOM WINTER NOW FOR MORE. I WANT YOU TO HELP US. PUT IT INTO THE PLAINEST AND CLEAREST ENGLISH POSSIBLE. SOUNDS TO ME LIKE. THIS GUY WAS ACCUSED OF SELLING SECRETS TO CHINA. IS THAT RIGHT? >>. Reporter. THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT, HALLIE. WE WANT TO BE SPECIFIC ABOUT THE TERMS HERE. JUNE OF 2020, KORBEIN SCHULTZ, WHO WAS ARRESTED THIS MORNING, STARTED COMMUNICATING. AFTER HE WAS REACHED OUT BY A CONSPIRATOR BASED IN HONG KONG. THIS INDIVIDUAL IS A FOREIGN NATIONAL, SAYS HE'S A BUSINESS CONSULTANT INTERESTING THE WAY THE INDICTMENT IS WORDED. REACHED OUT TO SCHULTZ AND THEN- APPARENTLY- YOU'RE LOOKING AT A PHOTO OF HIM HERE- APPARENTLY STARTED ASKING HIM FOR CLASSIFIED INFORMATION, SECRET INFORMATION. SCHULTZ IS NOT CHARGED WITH SHARING ANY SORT OF CLASSIFIED OR TOP SECRET INFORMATION, BUT HE IS CHARGED WITH SHARING NATIONAL DEFENSE INFORMATION. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT F-22, THE RAPTOR, FIGHTER THE MANUALS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT SENSITIVE MILITARY TECHNOLOGY, AS IT PERTAINS TO NUCLEAR WEAPONS, AS IT PERTAINS TO DEFENSE CAPABILITIES OF THE US, AS IT PERTAINS TO HELICOPTERS, AND EXACTLY WHAT THE US' OBSERVATIONS OF ITS OWN MILITARY DRILLS BY CHINA WERE. INCLUDING HIS THOUGHTS ON WHAT THE US MIGHT DO IF TAIWAN WERE TO BE ATTACKED. HALLIE, IT WAS JUST THREE DAYS AGO. YOU AND I WERE SITTING ON SET TOGETHER TALKING ABOUT A SEPARATE CASE INVOLVING A MEMBER OF THE UNITED STATES MILITARY ABOUT JUST HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS FOR A FOREIGN COUNTRY TO UNDERSTAND THE US' THINKING ABOUT THAT FOREIGN COUNTRY'S CAPABILITIES OR OBSERVATIONS. SO THIS IS SERIOUS. IT'S THE THIRD CASE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS WEEK. IT'S SOMETHING. WE'RE KEEPING TRACK ON AS FAR AS THE TREND OF THIS, OUR OWN PEOPLE SHARING OUR OWN INFORMATION. >> GOOD TO HAVE YOU ON. >>>. COURT WRAPPING UP TONIGHT IN THE LAST HOUR IN MICHIGAN WITH INTENSE MOMENTS, THE FATHER OF A SCHOOL SHOOTER REALIZING HIS SON MAY HAVE BEEN THE GUNMAN IN A SECOND OF ITS KIND TRIAL. I WANT YOU TO LISTEN TO THIS DRAMATIC MOMENT. THAT'S JAMES CRUMBLEY IN COURT. THAT'S JAMES CRUMBLEY IN COURT TODAY LISTENING TO THAT PHONE CALL- PLAY OUT WITH HEADPHONES BECAUSE HE HAS DIFFICULTY HEARING. THE 47-YEAR-OLD FATHER I FACING FOUR COUNTS OF INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER. THE SAME CHARGES HIS WIFE, JENNIFER, FACED IN HER UNPRECEDENTED TRIAL. LAST MONTH SHE WAS FOUND GUILTY FOR THE DEATHS OF THESE FOUR STUDENTS- STUDENTS KILLED IN THE 2021 SHOOTING ATTACK AT OXFORD HIGH SCHOOL. THEIR SON IS SERVING LIVE IN PRISON. MAGGIE VESPA IS IN PONTIAC, MICHIGAN. MAGGIE, JUST THE LATEST STAKES OUT HERE FOR PEOPLE. WE HADN'T SEEN THIS BEFORE JENNIFER CRUMBLEY'S TRIAL. THE MOTHER, AS WE SAID, FOUND GUILTY. NOW THE FATHER IS ON TRIAL OPENING STATEMENTS TODAY. WENT PRETTY QUICKLY, WALK US THROUGH IT AND HOW IT'S DIFFERENT FROM JENNIFER'S TRIAL- THE MOM'S TRIAL >>. Reporter. YEAH, HALLIE, IT WAS REALLY STRIKING AS YOU POINT OUT. THIS IS STILL A MAJOR PRECEDENT BEING SET LEGALLY RIGHT. THIS IS ONLY THE SECOND OF ITS KIND CASE. HOWEVER, TO SOME DEGREE, THIS DOES FEEL LIKE A BIT OF A RINSE AND REPEAT FROM JENNIFER CRUMBLEY'S CASE A MONTH AGO. THE DEFENSE'S OPENING STATEMENT- JAMES CRUMBLEY'S ATTORNEY ONLY SPEAKING FOR SEVEN MINUTES TOTAL. THE ATTORNEY SAYING JAMES COULDN'T HAVE KNOWN WHAT HIS TEENAGE SON WAS PLANNING, THAT HE HAD NO REASON TO THINK THAT HIS SON WAS A DANGER. THE PROSECUTION, SPECIFICALLY IN THIS CASE, HAVE DELINEATING FACTORS SAYING JAMES CRUMBLEY WAS THE ADULT IN THE HOUSE IN CHARGE OF SECURING THE GUN. THAT IS KEY TO THEIR CASE AND A DIFFERENT FACTOR FROM JENNIFER CRUMBLEY'S CASE. ETHAN CRUMBLEY ASKED HIS PARENTS, INCLUDING HIS FATHER, FOR HELP. THEY DECLINED TO GET HIM HELP INSTEAD BUYING THAT GUN AND TAKING HIM TO A SHOOTING RANGE. HERE'S WHAT WE HEARD IN THE OPENING STATEMENTS TODAY: >> INSTEAD OF RECEIVING HELP OR INTERVENTION OF ANY KIND, JAMES CRUMBLEY BEGAN TO TAKE HIS SON TO THE SHOOTING RANGE THIS NIGHTMARE. THESE MURDERS WERE PREVENTABLE BY HIM, FORESEEABLE BY HIM. >> WHEN YOU'RE NOT AWARE OF AN IMMEDIATE, IMMINENT DANGER, WHY WOULD YOU DO ANYTHING DIFFERENT THAN WHAT YOU NORMALLY DO? >>. Reporter. A LOT OF WHAT WE'RE HEARING IN THIS CASE IS SIMILAR TO JENNIFER CRUMBLEY'S CASE. SHE FACED THE SAME CHARGES: FOUR COUNTS OF INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER. THE JURY DELIBERATED FOR JUST 11 HOURS, EFFECTIVELY TWO DAYS- BEFORE CONVICTING HER ON THOSE COUNTS. WE HEARD FROM 21 WITNESSES IN THAT CASE, INCLUDING LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS, INCLUDING HER BOSS AT THE TIME, WHO SAID SHE COULD HAVE LEFT WORK THAT MORNING TO TAKE HER SON HOME, AND A LOT OF SCHOOL STAFFERS THEMSELVES. A LOT OF THOSE WITNESSES ON THE WITNESS LIST IN THIS CASE, AS WELL ONE KEY POINT THOUGH THE DEFENSE IN THAT CASE, ONLY CALLING JENNIFER HERSELF TO THE STAND. AND HALLIE AT THIS POINT WE DON'T KNOW IF JAMES WILL FOLLOW HIS WIFE'S LEAD AND TAKE THE STAND. HIS ATTORNEYS HAVEN'T LAID OUT THEIR PLANS, YET >>. MAGGIE VESPA, LIVE IN PONTIAC. WE'RE GLAD YOU'RE THERE BRINGING US THAT REPORTING, THANK YOU. >>>. 10 MILLION PEOPLE IN ALABAMA AND GEORGIA UNDER FLOOD WATCHES ON THE HEELS OF A LOT OF RAIN IN THESE LAST 24 HOURS LEAVING ROADS FLOODED HERE IN ATLANTA LEAVING CARS STRUCK AND SOME DUCKS DUCKING. NINE MILLION PEOPLE ARE BRACING FOR HAIL. A TON OF WIND MAYBE EVEN TORNADOES. THE DUCKS LIKE IT WHEN IT RAINS. THIS MUCH RAIN FOR FOLKS IN THE SOUTH CAN GET TO BE POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS. TALK US THROUGH IT. >>. I NEVER LIKE IT WHEN WE HAVE A FLOOD EVENT FORECASTED. RIGHT AFTER WE JUST HAD A FLOOD. YOU SAW THE PICTURES THERE IN THE ATLANTA AREA. YOU KNOW THE GROUND IS SATURATED, THE RIVERS ARE UP. IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH RAIN TO GET EXTREME FLOODING. THAT'S GOING TO BE TOMORROW. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE IMMEDIATE THREAT HAPPENING NOW. WE HAVE SEVERE THUNDERSTORM WATCHES THAT HAVE BEEN POSTED FROM KANSAS THROUGH OKLAHOMA CITY, WICHITA FALLS. THESE WATCHES WILL GO TO ABOUT 9-10:00.. WE MAY GET A TORNADO WATCH DURING THE OVERNIGHT HOURS IN CENTRAL TEXAS. WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT IN A SECOND, NOT A FUN COMMUTE. DALLAS FORT WORTH, NORTHWARD, INTERSTATE 35, IT IS POURING. THERE IS ONE SEVERE THUNDERSTORM WARNING OUT HERE TO THE SOUTH OF GRAHAM, THERE'S ANOTHER SEVERE THUNDERSTORM WITH LARGE HAIL HEADING TOWARD BLACKWELL. THESE STORMS ARE RAMPING UP, GETTING STRONGER DURING THE OVERNIGHT. WE'LL START TO INTRODUCE THE CHANCE OF A FEW TORNADOES. THIS IS THE AREA AT RISK, PRETTY MUCH. THE EXACT SAME SPOTS WHERE WE HAVE THE WATCHES. THIS IS THE AREA, IF WE GET, TORNADOES WOULD HAPPEN 3:00 AM TO MAYBE LIKE 6:00 AM, SO LIKE DEAD OF THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, TOWARD THE EARLY MORNING. AND THIS IS THE AREA JUST SOUTH OF FORT WORTH. TOMORROW WE TAKE THIS THREAT THROUGH THE SOUTHEAST, FROM DALLAS TO AREAS OF ALABAMA. THE FLOOD WATCH IS FRIDAY EVENING, HALLIE, THREE DAYS IN A ROW. WE'LL BE TRACKING SEVERE WEATHER THROUGH THE SOUTH. >>. I KNOW YOU'LL BE WATCHING IT ALL. >>> MORE TO GET TO, INCLUDING NEW DETAILS ON THE BIGGEST WILDFIRE IN TEXAS HISTORY. HOW THE FDA IS EXPANDING ITS. >>> TO SOME DEVELOPING HEALTH. >>> TO SOME DEVELOPING HEALTH NEWS. TODAY MORE KIDS ENDING UP IN EMERGENCY ROOMS WHY THEY'RE ACCIDENTALLY OVERDOSING ON MELATONIN TURNS OUT. KIDS ARE FINDING THEIR PARENTS GUMMIES THAT HAVE MELATONIN IN THEM. THE CDC IS SAYING: ER VISITS FOR BABIES AND LITTLE KIDS WHO INGESTED MELATONIN WENT UP 400% BETWEEN 2009 AND 2020.. AND THE STUDY SPECIFICALLY POINTS TO THOSE GUMMIES YOU SEE SIMILAR TO THE ONES HERE AND TO CHEWABLE TABLETS BEING APPEALING TO LITTLE KIDS. THE STUDY ALSO POINTS OUT. MELATONIN SUPPLEMENTS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO HAVE CHILD RESISTANT CAPS. DID YOU KNOW? THAT IS THE REASON WE'RE SEEING A SPIKE IN THIS IS BECAUSE MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE TAKING MELATONIN GENERALLY AND THESE GUMMIES ARE IN MORE HOUSEHOLDS >>. I THINK THAT'S A BIG PART OF IT. YOU HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD IN THE INTRO. THESE SUPPLEMENTS- OVER HALF OF THESE ER VISITS- WERE FROM GUMMIES. TO BE FAIR, THESE THINGS ARE BECOMING VERY APPETIZING TO CHILDREN. THEY CAN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS AND SOMETHING THAT LOOKS LIKE SOUR SKITTLES. HALLIE, TO THE POINT YOU BROUGHT UP EARLIER. THEY'RE NOT REQUIRED TO HAVE CHILD RESISTANT PACKAGING OR CHILD PROOF TOPS. THE ONES YOU HAVE TO HOLD AND PUSH DOWN TO THE SIDE ARE NOT REQUIRED BY MELATONIN MANUFACTURERS. HALLIE, SOME NUMBERS HERE. UP 36% OF ALL CASES INVOLVE 10 OR MORE GUMMIES. MOST COME IN ABOUT FIVE MILLIGRAM DOSES. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 50 MILLIGRAMS OF MELATONIN. YOU SHOULDN'T GO MORE THAN THREE TO SIX IN A CHILD'S CASE HERE. >>. IS THERE ANYTHING PARENTS CAN TAKE? YOU KNOW, I KNOW, JUST AS A PARENT MYSELF- I KNOW SOME PARENTS, AND THEY DO IT ON THE ADVICE OF PEDIATRICIAN, GIVING THEIR KIDS SMALL AMOUNTS OF MELATONIN. WHAT WOULD YOU RECOMMEND FOR KIDS AND PARENTS WHO HAVE TROUBLE SLEEPING? >>. THERE'S NO FDA APPROVED MEDICATION FOR INSOMNIA IN CHILDREN. IF I WERE A PARENT GIVING ADVICE TO A PARENT, YOU DON'T WANT SOMEBODY TO FORM, HABIT- FORMING THINGS OR FEEL LIKE THEY NEED SOMETHING TO GO TO SLEEP, ESPECIALLY AT THAT YOUNG OF AN AGE. WE RECOMMEND BEHAVIORAL MEDICATION: PUTTING AWAY THE SCREENS, TURNING OFF THE BLUE LIGHT, SETTING A REGULAR SLEEP SCHEDULE. AND IF YOU HAVE TO USE MELATONIN, IT'S NOT A SLEEPING PILL. IT'S SOMETHING YOU CAN USE IN THE SHORT TERM TO GET ADJUSTED, BUT IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU WANT TO BE DEPENDENT ON, ESPECIALLY AT A YOUNG AGE >>>. LET'S GET YOU TO THE FIVE THINGS OUR TEAM THINKS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THE MAN BEHIND LAST YEAR'S MASS SHOOTING IN MAINE. SUFFERED TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURIES WHICH MAY HAVE INFLUENCED HIS ACTIONS, HE WAS EVENTUALLY FOUND DEAD DAYS LATER HIS FAMILY APOLOGIZED FOR THE ATTACK. HOPING RELEASING THESE FINDINGS MAY HELP PREVENT FUTURE TRAGEDIES. TEXAS ANNOUNCING POWER LINES IGNITED THE BIGGEST WILDFIRE IN THE STATE'S HISTORY. WE TALKED ABOUT THE SMOKEHOUSE CREEK FIRE THAT BURNED THROUGH MORE THAN A MILLION ACRES IT'S 74% CONTAINED. THESE FINDINGS COME HOURS AFTER A UTILITY COMPANY SAID ONE OF ITS FACILITIES MAY HAVE BEEN PART OF WHAT STARTED THE FIRE. THEY DENY ANY NEGLIGENCE. GROUND CINNAMON MAY BE CONTAMINATED WITH LEAD. THERE'S A LIST OF WHICH BRANDS ARE AFFECTED. THE AGENCY SAYS: IF YOU HAVE ANY OF THEM, THROW THEM AWAY, AND IF YOU'RE LIKE- I JUST REMEMBER HEARING ABOUT CINNAMON AND LEAD- IT WAS THE CINNAMON APPLESAUCE POUCHES TAINTED WITH LEAD, NUMBER FOUR. IF YOUR DREAM RESTAURANT IS AN APPLEBEE'S AND AN IHOP UNDER ONE ROOF, PANCAKES AND RIBLETS TOGETHER AT LAST. GREAT NEWS FOR YOU. IT'S HAPPENING. APPARENTLY. DUAL-BRANDED LOCATIONS OPENING. SO-CALLED PROTOTYPE LOCATIONS ARE OPENING AROUND THE WORLD. THEY'LL EVENTUALLY COME TO THE. THEY'LL EVENTUALLY COME TO THE US. THE IDEA IS TO COMBINE APPLEBEE'S AND I HOP NUMBER FIVE. 29-YEAR-OLD COLE BRAUER RACED NONSTOP AROUND THE WORLD BY HERSELF. SHE WAS GREETED BY A CHEERING CROWD OF FAMILY AND FRIENDS WAITING FOR HER ON SHORE TODAY IN SPAIN. THE SAILING TRIP TOOK 130 DAYS, COVERING 30,000 MILES- AMAZING >>>. WHEN WE COME BACK IN JUST THE NEXT FEW HOURS, YOU KNOW IT. WE ARE NOW JUST WHAT THREE AND A HALF HOURS AWAY FROM PRESIDENT BIDEN'S STATE OF THE UNION. WE'RE ABOUT TO GO ONE ON ONE WITH A MEMBER OF LEADERSHIP ON WHAT SHE'D LIKE TO HEAR >>>. NBC NEWS COVERS HUNDREDS OF >>>. NBC NEWS COVERS HUNDREDS OF STORIES EVERY DAY, BECAUSE IT CAN BE TOUGH TO READ OR WATCH OR LISTEN TO THEM. ALL OUR TEAMS IN THE BUREAUS HAVE DONE IT FOR YOU. THIS IS WHAT THEY TELL US IS GOING ON IN THEIR REGION IN A SEGMENT WE CALL THE LOCAL THE ARMORER ON THE MOVIE RUST GETS, SENTENCED JUST YESTERDAY. THAT'S HER MOM RIGHT THERE. EXCUSE ME, GET CONVICTED, SHE WILL BE SENTENCED SOON. A JURY FOUND HANNAH GUTIERREZ- REED, GUILTY IN AN ON-SET SHOOTING DEATH OF THE SET'S CINEMATOGRAPHER. SHE FACES UP TO 18 MONTHS IN PRISON. A PAIR OF COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES IN FLORIDA RACING TO SAVE TWO PEOPLE TRAPPED IN A CAR UNDERWATER ONE DEPUTY PULLS SOMEBODY OUT AND STARTS GIVING LIFE-SAVING CPR. IT IS VERY INTENSE TO WATCH. INCREDIBLY, BOTH PEOPLE IN THE CAR SURVIVED. THANKS TO THOSE HEROES. OUT OF OUR SOUTHERN BUREAU, A RECYCLING PLANT UP IN FLAMES. THIS IS IN ROCKY MOUNT, STILL BURNING EVEN AS OF THIS AFTERNOON, AFTER BEING REPORTED LAST NIGHT. YOU CAN SEE THE FLAMES THERE. YOU CAN SEE CREWS TRYING TO PUT IT OUT, NOT CLEAR, YET IF ANYBODY WAS HURT >>> THE STATE OF THE UNION. NOW, JUST ABOUT THREE HOURS AWAY, I WANT TO BRING IN SOMEBODY WHO'S WANT TO BRING IN SOMEBODY WHO'S GOING TO BRING IN THE HOUSE CHAMBER CONGRESSWOMAN CATHERINE KATHRYN CLARK. >> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. >>. IT IS A BIG NIGHT. IT IS A BUSY NIGHT AND PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS A LOT ON THE LINE HERE- AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET HIS MESSAGE OUT TO MILLIONS OF AMERICANS IN WHAT IS A VERY BUSY WEEK. WE'RE FRESH OFF SUPER TUESDAY. WHAT DOES THE PRESIDENT NEED TO SAY TONIGHT? WHAT DO YOU WANT TO HEAR FROM HIM? >>. Reporter. I THINK WHAT WE ARE GOING TO HEAR FROM THE PRESIDENT IS THAT HE IS ABOUT THE FORWARD PROGRESS, BUILDING ON THE PROGRESS HE HAS ALREADY MADE, ALL THE WORK HE HAS DONE AND STANDING STRONG IN THE CONTRAST WITH DONALD TRUMP, WHO WANTS TO TAKE US BACKWARDS. I AM EXCITED. I KNOW ALSO THAT IT IS GOING TO BE ROOTED IN REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM, WHICH IS ONE OF THE HIGHEST CONTRASTS, AND I AM SO GRATEFUL TO PRESIDENT BIDEN FOR HIS LEADERSHIP WHEN WE ARE REALLY AT A CROSSROADS IN THIS COUNTRY ON. ARE WE GOING TO GO FORWARD AS A DEMOCRACY? ARE WE GOING TO PROCEED WITH EQUALITY FOR WOMEN? >>. YOU MENTIONED OBVIOUSLY THE ISSUE OF REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS. WE KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING. DEMOCRATS WILL BE MOBILIZING FOR VOTERS COME NOVEMBER. IT RELATES TO YOUR GUEST TONIGHT, A WOMAN FROM TEXAS TALK US THROUGH THE MESSAGE THAT YOU'RE HOPING TO SEND WITH YOUR GUESTS, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHO THE BIGGEST ISSUES TO AMERICANS MORE BROADLY, IT'S ECONOMY, IT'S IMMIGRATION NUMBER ONE IS NOT REPRODUCTIVE ACCESS. HOW DO YOU SEE THAT PLAYING INTO NOVEMBER >>? OH, REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM IS ABSOLUTELY GOING TO BE A TOP ISSUE FOR 2024.. AND I'M SO HONORED AND PRIVILEGED TO HAVE AMANDA AS MY GUEST. SHE IS THE LEAD PLAINTIFF IN THE CASE AGAINST TEXAS AND HER, THE CASE AGAINST TEXAS, AND HER STORY AND MY STORY ARE A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF PRE-DOBBS AND POST-DOBBS. WHEN I NEEDED AN ABORTION TO PREVENT INFECTION, I GOT IT FROM MY DOCTOR AND I GOT THE CARE I NEEDED IMMEDIATELY. THEN WE GO POST-DOBBS AND AMANDA, WHO WAS SIX MONTHS PREGNANT, HER WATER BROKE, HER BABY WAS NOT GOING TO SURVIVE BUT INSTEAD OF BEING ABLE TO ACCESS THE CARE SHE NEEDED, SHE WAS TOLD TO GO HOME AND WAIT UNTIL INFECTION SET IN AND IT DID AND SHE'S SPENT DAYS IN THE ICU BARELY HANGING ON TO HER LIFE. AND NOW HER ROAD TO MOTHERHOOD CONTINUES TO BE THROUGH. FERTILITY TREATMENT, IVF, AND WHAT SHE IS TERRIFIED OF IS THE ALABAMA DECISION, BECAUSE THE EXTREMISTS IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY ARE NOT NOW ONLY SAYING IF AND WHEN WOMEN AND FAMILIES CAN HAVE CHILDREN, BUT HOW. AND SO HER STORY RESONATES WITH AMERICANS AND AMERICAN WOMEN ACROSS THIS COUNTRY, BUT ESPECIALLY FOR THE 21 MILLION WOMEN WHO ARE LIVING IN STATES THAT HAVE BANNED THIS ESSENTIAL HEALTHCARE >>. OBVIOUSLY THE COTON. VERY ABLE RULING IN ALABAMA. PUTTING ABLE RULING IN ALABAMA, PUTTING A SPOTLIGHT ON THE ISSUE OF REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS. YET, CONGRESSWOMAN, YOU KNOW WHAT PRESIDENT BIDEN'S APPROVAL RATING IS. IT IS 37%. THAT IS LOWER THAN FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP IN HIS LAST STATE OF THE UNION, LOWER THAN FORMER PRESIDENT OBAMA IN 2012,. LOWER THAN FORMER PRESIDENT BUSH AND LOWER THAN FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON. IT'S NOT GOOD. IT'S NOT WHERE I ASSUME BIDEN WOULD LIKE IT TO BE. WHAT DOES HE NEED TO DO TO TURN THAT AROUND? DOES HE HAVE CONCERNS? HE'S NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO RESONATE WITH VOTERS COME THE FALL >>. ABSOLUTELY NOT. I AM ENTHUSIASTICALLY ENDORSING PRESIDENT BIDEN BECAUSE OF WHAT HE HAS ACCOMPLISHED WHEN WE GO FROM THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN AND PULLING US OUT OF THE PANDEMIC, TO THE INFRASTRUCTURE LAW TO THE FIRST GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION BILL IN 30 YEARS, TO BRINGING MANUFACTURING BACK TO OUR SHORES, THROUGH THE SHIPS AND SCIENCE ACT, REDUCING THE COST OF HEALTHCARE, CAPPING INULIN AT $35 A MONTH, REDUCING PREMIUMS IN THE ACA AND A HISTORIC INVESTMENT IN BUILDING RESILIENCY IN OUR COUNTRY TO CLIMATE CHANGE. BUT HE KNOWS THE JOB IS NOT DONE. HE KNOWS THAT FAMILIES ARE STILL STRUGGLING AND THE WORK AND THE VISION HE HAS FOR THE FUTURE, FOR HIS SECOND TERM, IS IN LINE WITH WHAT I HEAR FROM FAMILIES ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY, AND THAT IS THAT WE NEED: TO FOCUS ON THOSE CONTINUED LOWERING COSTS, WHETHER IT'S CHILDCARE OR GROCERIES, OR ADDRESSING OUR HOUSING CRISIS. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM THE PRESIDENT TONIGHT >>. THE OTHER THING WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM PRESIDENT WE KNOW IS THAT HE IS WIDELY EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE A NEW PORT OFF THE COAST OF THE GAZA STRIP TO BRING MORE HUMANITARIAN HELP TO PEOPLE WHO NEED IT: THE CIVILIANS, THE INNOCENT PEOPLE IN GAZA. THE WAY THE WHITE HOUSE HAS HANDLED THIS WAR IS SOMETHING. PROGRESSIVES HAVE BEEN UPSET OVER. WE'VE SEEN ACTIVISTS REPEATEDLY CONFRONTING THE PRESIDENT ON THIS. DO YOU THINK THAT COULD HAPPEN TONIGHT? >>. WHAT WE HAVE HEARD FROM THE PRESIDENT AND THE VICE PRESIDENT OVER THE LAST WEEK IS ONE. THAT IS EXACTLY WHERE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE. WE STAND WITH ISRAELIS AND OUR ALLY IN ISRAEL, BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT WE HAVE A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN GAZA, AND THE PRESIDENT HAS STARTED DOING AIR DROPS OF HUMANITARIAN RELIEF BUT WE KNOW THAT'S NOT ENOUGH. SO BUILDING THIS PIER BEING ABLE TO BRING IN THE AID THAT IS DESPERATELY NEEDED IMMEDIATELY IS A CRITICAL STEP IN ADDRESSING THE DEATH AND DESTRUCTION THAT WE ARE SEEING IN GAZA. SO THE PRESIDENT CONTINUES TO CALL FOR A CEASEFIRE TO BE AT THAT NEGOTIATING TABLE, TO BE PUSHING FOR PEACE IN THIS REGION WHILE MEETING THE NEEDS OF GAZANS, AND HE IS ALSO, AT THE SAME TIME, SETTING THE STAGE ACROSS THE REGION FOR THE DAY AFTER AND HOW WE TRULY BRING A SOLUTION AND MAKE SURE BOTH PALESTINIANS AND ISRAELIS HAVE THE SECURITY THEY DESERVE. >>. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING WITH US. WE'RE GLAD TO HAVE YOU. WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME ON A BUSY NIGHT >>> TALKING ABOUT THE ISRAEL HAMAS WAR- AND YOU KNOW THAT'S GOING TO BE FRONT AND CENTER, WITH MORE THAN A DOZEN FAMILY MEMBERS OF HAMAS-HELD HOSTAGES IN THE AUDIENCE AS GUESTS, AS MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND THEN OF COURSE WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT THE PLAN THAT THE PRESIDENT IS EXPECTED TO ROLL OUT, ABOUT THAT NEW PORT ON THE COASTLINE SO SHIPS CAN GET AID DIRECTLY TO FOLKS THERE. ALL OF IT OF COURSE RELATED TO THAT HUMANITARIAN CRISIS. AND ON THE HEELS OF THE US AIR DROPPING FOOD, MEDICINE AND SUPPLIES INTO GAZA, STARTING JUST A FEW DAYS AGO. IT'S HAPPENING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH JORDAN. RICHARD ENGLE JOINED THE JORDANIAN AIR FORCE FOR ONE OF THOSE MISSIONS. HE'S GOT THIS REPORT >>. Reporter. WE JUST FINISHED ACCOMPANYING AN AID DROP THAT LEFT FROM HERE IN JORDAN, FROM THIS MILITARY BASE ON THIS PLANE, AND DROPPED HUMANITARIAN SUPPLIES INTO THE GAZA STRIP. THIS ONE WENT TO NORTHERN GAZA, WHICH IS THE HARDEST HIT AREA, WHERE THE HUNGER IS AT ITS MOST SEVERE. LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT WHAT WE SAW AND HOW IT WORKS. THIS PLANE WAS ABLE TO HOLD ROUGHLY 25,000 MEALS. THESE ARE SUPPLIES DONATED BY THE JORDANIAN GOVERNMENT IN THIS CASE, BUT THERE ARE ALSO SUPPLIES DONATED FROM CHARITIES, FROM THE UNITED STATES, FROM THE UN AND IT'S A VERY SIMPLE, OLD-FASHIONED KIND OF MECHANISM. THE PALETTES ARE ATTACHED TO A BIG SLED AND ON TOP OF THE PALETTES ARE PARACHUTES, AND WHEN YOU GET OVER GAZA, THE CREW OPENS THIS BACK DOOR AND THE PALETTES SIMPLY SLIDE OFF AND FLOAT DOWN TO THE PEOPLE OF GAZA. NOW, GAZA'S NOT VERY FAR FROM HERE, BUT THIS TOOK A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF TIME, BECAUSE EVERY STEP OF THIS PROCESS WAS COORDINATED WITH THE ISRAELI MILITARY AND AS WE WERE FLYING OVER AND EVEN BEFORE WE GOT TO ISRAELI AIR SPACE, THE JORDANIANS WERE TALKING TO THE ISRAELIS, DECONFLICTING IT, AND THEN, WHEN WE ENTERED GAZA ITSELF, THERE WASN'T A TRUE EFFORT TO CREATE A CEASEFIRE, BUT THEY WERE DECONFLICTING THE MILITARY SO THAT THE PLANE WLDN'T GET SHOT DOWN, BECAUSE THE ISRAELIS DON'T WANT TO SHOOT DOWN A JORDANIAN PLANE. JORDAN IS AN ALLY OF ISRAEL, HAS A PEACE TREATY WITH ISRAEL, AND THERE'S A LOT OF ATTENTION AND SENSITIVITY ABOUT THESE MISSIONS. RIGHT NOW. SO IT WAS COORDINATED, IT TOOK HOURS AND IT IS VERY, VERY SLOW. AID AGENCIES WILL TELL YOU THIS IS ALL HELPFUL. THE PEOPLE OF GAZA NEED ASSISTANCE BUT THIS IS A DROP IN THE BUCKET. YOU CAN'T MEET THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE OF GAZA DROPPING PALETTES OF FOOD, ONE AT A TIME. IT'S HELPFUL, BUT NOT A SOLUTION. >>. OUR THANKS TO RICHARD ENGLE FOR THAT REPORTING. >>>. COME UP, STEPPED UP SECURITY IN ONE OF THE BIGGEST TRANSIT SYSTEMS IN THE NORTHEAST: THE CRIME PROMPTING THOSE >>>. FOR THE FIRST DAY TODAY >>> FOR THE FIRST DAY TODAY, WE'RE SEEING HUNDREDS OF NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS PATROLLING THE NEW YORK CITY SUBWAY- 750 IN ALL, PLUS 250 OFFICERS FROM STATE AND MTA LOOK AT THAT AFTER A SERIES OF HIGH-PROFILE ATTACKS, THE NATIONAL GUARD SET TO DO THINGS LIKE RANDOM BAG CHECKS AT ANOTHER METRO SYSTEM. A BIT FURTHER, SOUTH POLICE IN PHILADELPHIA ARE LOOKING FOR THE SUSPECTS ACCUSED OF SHOOTING EIGHTEENS ON A PUBLIC BUS. GEORGE SCALISE IS JOINING US NOW. THESE TEENAGERS WERE GETTING ON THIS BUS NEAR PHILLY >>. Reporter. THE INVESTIGATION VERY MUCH UNDER WAY. POLICE RELEASING SURVEILLANCE VIDEO CAPTURING THE HARROWING MOMENTS BEFORE THAT HAIL OF GUNFIRE ERUPTED. WHAT YOU SEE IS THREE SUSPECTS GETTING OUT OF A BLUE HYUNDAI, AS DESCRIBED BY POLICE, AND THEY RUN UP TO THIS BUS STOP. THAT IS FREQUENTED BY HIGH SCHOOLERS. 30 SHOTS, OR SO, WERE FIRED. WE HAVE LEARNED FROM POLICE THAT WAS A STOLEN CAR. THEY ARE LOOKING FOR THE FOURTH PERSON, THE DRIVER IN THE VEHICLE. THEY ARE LOOKING TO SEE IF THIS SHOOTING MAY BE CONNECTED TO ANOTHER SHOOTING THAT HAPPENED EARLIER THIS WEEK THAT ALSO INVOLVED TEENAGERS. YES, THIS HAIL OF GUNFIRE INJURING THOSE EIGHTEENS, BRINGING THE FULL TOTAL OF JUVENILES INJURED IN THIS CITY TO 11.. THAT IS A STAGGERING FIGURE THAT HAS PROMPTED A RESPONSE FROM THE ATF AND FROM THE MAYOR, THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY, THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE DISTRICT OF PHILADELPHIA. EVERYONE IS WEIGHING IN SAYING THIS VIOLENCE IS COMPLETELY OUT OF HAND AND THEY NEED TO DO SOMETHING. THEY'RE CALLING ON PARENTS EVEN TO DO THOSE BAG CHECKS, TO DO CHECKS OF BEDROOMS FOR ANY OF THESE WEAPONS THAT MAY BE CIRCLING THESE STREETS, TO PREVENT ANOTHER SHOOTING LIKE THIS HAPPENING. ONE OF THE PEOPLE THAT WAS SHOT YESTERDAY HALLIE ABOUT NINE TIMES FROM WHAT POLICE TOLD US TODAY. THEY'RE NOT SURE IF THIS TEEN WAS TARGETED, BUT GIVEN SOME OF THE LIKELIHOOD AND SOME OF THE THINGS THEY ARE STARTING TO.",[52]

WHAT YOU THINK OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT? >>. IT'S A SIGN OF HOW FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP REIGNS OVER THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND ITS ORGANIZATION AS HE MARCHES TO BECOME THE LIKELY PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE. DONALD TRUMP HAS ALREADY ENDORSED THE CHAIR OF THE NORTH CAROLINA REPUBLICAN PARTY TO BE THE NEXT CHAIR. THE RNC HAS STRUGGLED TO RAISE MONEY AND AFTER THE REPUBLICANS LOST IN 2018 MIDTERMS, THE 2022 ELECTIONS.

WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN IS SOME BIG DONORS- AMERICA'S FOR PROSPERITY AND OTHERS- HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THERE IS NO MARGINAL RETURN ON INVESTMENT FOR EACH DOLLAR THEY PUT INTO NIKKI HALEY. WHEN SHE WORKS AND LOOKS AT THE OUTLOOK, SHE WILL HAVE SOME MONEY TO COMPETE, BUT THE TRUTH IS THERE IS NOT A SINGLES DATE THAT SHE CAN IDENTIFY, THAT SHE IS GOING TO WIN, AND SHE CANNOT COME IN FIRST IN ANY STATE SO SHE CANNOT WIN THE NOMINATION. >>. LET'S TALK ABOUT MICHIGAN THAT TAKES PLACE TOMORROW MICHIGAN CONGRESSWOMAN. ONCE PEOPLE TO VOTE UNCOMMITTED IN THE PRIMARY. THIS WAS IN RESPONSE TO WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE HAD TO SAY ABOUT ISRAEL AND HUMAS. WHAT KIND OF IMPACT DOES THIS HAVE? >> YES, IT'S A PROTEST AGAINST PRESIDENT BIDEN. WE HAVE SEEN THIS IN NATIONAL SURVEYS AND SOME POLLING IN MICHIGAN, WHERE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN TRAILS FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. THE MARGIN IS WITHIN THE MARGIN OF ERROR AND MICHIGAN IS AN OPEN PRIMARY. SEE, YOU'RE GOING TO SEE YOUNG PEOPLE PARTICIPATING IN THIS DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY AND THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY, AND THAT IS -- THAT BEING AN OPEN PRIMARY. NIKKI HALEY SEES AS A BENEFIT DESPITE TRAILING FOR SOME OF THE UPCOMING CONTEST. SOME OF THE INDEPENDENTS AND CROSSOVER DEMOCRATS MIGHT END UP VOTING FOR HER. >>. BEFORE I LET YOU GO, THIS IS LOOKING MORE AND MORE LIKE WE WILL HAVE A REMATCH BETWEEN PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN AND FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. THERE IS SOMETHING INTERESTING FROM MEET, THE PRESS WERE GAVIN NEWSOM BIDEN TO DEBATE TRUMP- WE KNOW IS CAMPAIGN- HAS BEEN NONCOMMITTAL TO THIS. WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THOSE COMMENTS? >>. I WANT TO KNOW WHAT WAS BEHIND THOSE COMMENTS. WHETHER THAT WAS IT SOMETHING THAT GOT THAT WAS IT SOMETHING THAT GOT A GREEN LIGHT? FOR THAT, I THINK THE BOTTOM LINE IS COMPLETELY UNCLEAR. OBVIOUSLY, WE HAVE SEEN FRUSTRATION FROM THE TRUMP SIDE ABOUT THE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE COMMISSION BUT THERE'S ALSO THE BIDEN SIDE. THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THIS. IT WOULD BE FASCINATING AND I THINK THE PUBLIC DESERVES TO SEE THIS DEBATE BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR. THAT WILL ACTUALLY HAPPEN. >>. OKAY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TAKING YOUR TIME OUT ON A MONDAY >>>. A DOZEN AIRSTRIKES HAVE BEEN LAUNCHED AGAINST LEBANON OVER THE WEEKEND. WE ARE JOINED BY A FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT IN LONDON. GOOD MORNING, SO TALK TO US ABOUT THESE WEEKEND STRIKES. >>. Reporter. THE US NEEDS THESE FIGHTER JETS BUT THEY HAVE BECOME TARGETS. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DRONES, AIR DEFENSE SYSTEM AND RADAR. WE ARE SEEING THESE ATTACKS BECAUSE THE FIGHTING IS NOT LETTING UP. THEY CONTINUE THEIR TAX YOU PAY TRIES TO STOP THEM TAKE. LAST WEEK THE MILITIA FIRED A MISSILE THAT SET A CARGO VESSEL ON FIRE. THESE ATTACKS ARE HAVING AN IMPACT. NINE% OF VESSELS HAVE DIVERTED AROUND AFRICA. THE COST WILL BE PASSED ON TO CONSUMERS. >>. AS YOU MENTIONED, THERE IS A CRISIS ONGOING. IT'S A JOINT MISSION TO HIS TOP ATTACKS. IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE. THAT IS DONE MUCH. WHAT ARE WE HEARING FROM US OFFICIALS AND IS THERE THAT THIS TIME MAKES A DIFFERENCE? >>. YOU ARE RIGHT, IT'S A FOURTH JOINT OPERATION WE HAVE SEEN SINCE JANUARY 12.. KEEP IN MIND: THE US HAS ALSO BEEN CARRYING OUT ALMOST DAILY STRIKES TO TAKE OUT TARGETS. THE US DEFENSE SECRETARY SAID: THE UNITED DAYS WILL NOT HESITATE TO TAKE BACK AND DEFEND LIVES IN THE FREE FLOW OF COMMERCE IN IT CRITICAL WATERWAY. WE WILL MAKE CLEAR THAT THEY WILL BEAR THE CONSEQUENCES IF THEY DO NOT STOP ILLEGAL ATTACKS, THEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT FOR JOINT ATTACKS WITH THE UNITED STATES AND UK SINCE JANUARY AND SO FAR THAT IS NOT SEEM TO STOP THEM FROM LAUNCHING COUNTERATTACKS. COUNTERATTACKS >>>. GIBSON GUITAR WILL HOST >>> GIBSON GUITAR WILL HOST TALKS. HUMAS SAYS ATTEMPTS, STRIKES ARE DETERRING THEM FROM CONTINUING ATTACKS AGAINST COMMERCIAL SHIPS IN THE RED SEA >>>. TWO YEARS SINCE THE WAR IN UKRAINE BEGAN, WORK THE PRESIDENT THERE SAID 31,000 SOLDIERS TO BE KILLED. THEY ARE RUNNING OUT OF SUPPLIES AND URGE CONGRESS TO APPROVE MORE MILITARY AID. HERE'S THE INTERVIEW >>. Reporter. AS UKRAINE COMMEMORATES TWO YEARS SINCE THE INVASION. THE PRESIDENT THE INVASION. THE PRESIDENT THERE SAID THEY SHOULD RAID SUPPLIES OF AMMUNITION. 21,000 TROOPS HAVE BEEN KILLED SO FAR. THE PRESIDENT SAID RUSSIAN TROOPS ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE LACK OF SUPPLIES WITH A NEW OFFENSIVE WHICH YOU WILL INTENSIFY OVER THE NEXT TWO MONTHS. I MET UP WITH THE PRESIDENT. THE PRESIDENT BEGAN BY SAYING: UKRAINE HAS NO CHOICE BUT TO KEEP FIGHTING, BECAUSE THE COST OF LOSING IS EVERYTHING, OF LOSING IS EVERYTHING >>. [ INAUDIBLE ]. I JUST RETURNED FROM SEVERAL AREAS ALONG THE FRONT LINE. SOLDIERS THERE TOLD ME THAT AFTER RATION AMMUNITION, WHAT HAPPENS YOUR COUNTRY IF AMERICAN AID DOES NOT ARRIVE? >> WE WILL LOSE A LOT OF PEOPLE AND TERRITORY. WE NEED A STRONG PACKAGE >>. DOES THE UNITED STATES WANT? >> DOES THE UNITED STATES WANT UKRAINE TO WIN THE WAR? JUST CONTAIN AND WE CAN RUSSIA >>. I HOPE SO. OTHERWISE, HOW DO WE STOP? IT'S TOO DIFFICULT TO LIVE WITHOUT INFRASTRUCTURE >>. YOU SAID YOU BELIEVE THIS YEAR IS A TURNING POINT FOR UKRAINE BECAUSE OF US ELECTIONS PARTLY. ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP? ARE YOU WORRIED THAT HE COULD PULL THE PLUG? >> I HOPE HE WILL NOT STOP IF HE WILL BE THE PRESIDENT. THAT IS THE DECISION OF YOUR PEOPLE. I COUNT ON REPRESENTATION. >>. UKRAINE COULD PRESENT ITS TERMS TO RUSSIA, FOLLOWED BY DIRECT THOUGHTS. THE KREMLIN HAS ALREADY REJECTED THE PROPOSAL. >> OKAY, THE EAST COAST AND SEVEN PLANES EXPECT ABOVE AVERAGE TEMPERATURES. THE WEST IS NOT SO LUCKY. THERE WAS SOME PROGRESS MADE. >> HELLO, IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU >>>. WE WILL SEE TEMPERATURES 30 TO 35 DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL PORTIONS OF THE EAST AND THE SOUTHERN PLAINS IN THE 90s. IT WILL FEEL LIKE SUMMER IN FEBRUARY SNOW IN THE WEST. WE HAD SNOW OVER THE WEEKEND AND WE WILL SEE THAT ONCE AGAIN TODAY. IT WILL BE VERY WINDY AS WELL: 60 TO 70 MILES PER HOUR WINDS. SO OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS WE HAVE FEBRUARY RECORD BEING BROKEN IN MANY AREAS. IT'S POSSIBLE IN 25 STATES. LOOK AT THE RED DOTS. THOSE ARE RECORD-BREAKING TEMPERATURES. OVER 100 RECORDS PER TOMORROW AND WEDNESDAY. THIS WILL ALSO BE POSSIBLE. THEN WELL, ABOVE AVERAGE TEMPERATURES. LOOK AT THESE NUMBERS: DALLAS: 93 DEGREES IS THE ACTIVE HIGH IN FEBRUARY. THAT WOULD BE A RECORD IN THE 80s IN EL PASO, CLOSED. 80 DEGREES IN KANSAS CITY AND 70 DEGREES IN CHICAGO. THE RECORD THERE IS 64 DEGREES. WE HAVE A CHANCE OF GETTING INTO THE LOW 60s >>. THEN A HUGE DIP FOR WEDNESDAY: A 40 DEGREES TUMBLE INTO WEDNESDAY FIRST TEMPERATURES INTO THE 90s IN SAN ANTONIO AND 80s IN OKLAHOMA CITY, 60s IN DETROIT- LOOK AT THIS TUMBLE THOUGH. FOR WEDNESDAY, THIS COLD FRONT BRINGS THE THREAT OF SEVERE STORMS AND IT CLEARS OUT THE WARM AIR. BIG DIFFERENCE FOR THURSDAY UNTIL WEDNESDAY: WARM IN DC, A 20 DEGREE DIFFERENCE ON FRIDAY. THESE GO UP AND THEN TUMBLE OUT. WEST: HEAVY SNOW FROM THE CASCADES TO THE ROCKIES. FEET OF SNOW, DAMAGING WINDS FROM MONTANA TO NEW MEXICO. THE WIND WILL GUST UP TO 70 MILES PER HOUR IN SOME SPOTS. BLIZZARD LIKE CONDITIONS, WITH SNOW FALLING ONE TO TWO INCHES PER HOUR. THE NORTHERN ROCKIES WILL HAVE HECTIC TRAVEL WHERE YOU SEE THE BLUE, THAT SNOW. THIS GOES ACROSS TO THE EAST AND CLEARS OUT WARMER TEMPERATURES BEFORE THAT, REALLY WARM AIR. AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT, SEVERE STORMS WILL COME THROUGH PORTIONS OF THE OHIO VALLEY AND TORNADOES LARGE HAIL, GUSTY WINDS AND HEAVY DOWNPOURS BEHIND THAT SNOW. FOR THE MIDWEST: COLD AIR BEHIND THE COLD FRONT COMING THROUGH WEDNESDAY. FOR MUCH OF THE EAST COAST: HEAVY RAIN FALLING ON WEDNESDAY, BUT THE TEMPERATURES WILL REALLY TUMBLE. 5 MILLION PEOPLE WILL BE IMPACTED BY WINTER. WEATHER ADVISORIES ARE COMING OUT FEET OF SNOW IN MANY SPOTS. THE WIND WILL BE GUSTY AND IT COULD BE TRICKY TRAVEL THROUGH THE INTERMOUNTAIN WET. THERE IS A SEVERE THREAT. A HEADS UP. THIS GOES INTO A HEADS UP. THIS GOES INTO WEDNESDAY AND 25 MILLION ARE AT RISK OF SEVERE WEATHER. TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY >>>. MUCH MORE TO COME.

THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION IS PARTIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS ATTACK. THIS COMES AS STUDENTS CONTINUE TO MOURN THE LOSS OF THE STUDENT. THE FAMILY IS PREPARING FOR FUNERAL HOMELAND SECURITY. CORRESPONDENT JOINS US WITH THE LATEST. SO WHAT NEW DETAILS ARE WE LEARNING ABOUT THE SUSPECT? >>. OVER THE WEEKEND WE LEARNED HE HAD BEEN ARRESTED BY THE NYPD IN NEW YORK IN SEPTEMBER OF LAST YEAR FOR ACTING IN A MANNER THAT WOULD INJURE A CHILD UNDER 17.. IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT THAT DETAILS OF THAT WAS. HE WAS ARRESTED. THEY WERE IN A SANCTUARY CITY THAT DOES NOT TELL ICE WHEN THEY WERE GOING TO RELEASE, SO THEY COULD NOT HAVE HIM REMOVED. THIS IS A CONTROVERSY THAT IS PLAYED OUT TIME AND TIME AGAIN. ICE WANTS TO REMOVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN CHARGED WITH CRIMES SO THEY CAN GO FOR DEPORTATION. HE WAS RELEASED WITHOUT OFFICIALS BEING NOTIFIED. SO TELL US MORE ABOUT THE BORDER POLICIES AND WHAT OTHER LAWMAKERS ARE SAYING ABOUT THE CRITICISM >>. IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT WE WOULD SEE A LOT OF DISAPPOINTMENT PLAYED OUT IN POLITICS, ESPECIALLY WITH IMMIGRATION BEING SUCH A HOT ISSUE GOING INTO THIS CAMPAIGN. THIS MAN SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN IN THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE OF THE BORDER POLICIES, OF RELEASING SOMEONE IN CITIES NOT COOPERATING. GO BACK AT LEAST THROUGH THE LAST THREE ADMINISTRATIONS. THEY ARE NOW USUALLY CROSSING THE BORDER ILLEGALLY. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE FLEEING OF VENEZUELA AND RECENTLY THEY STOPPED ALLOWING THE US AND MAX ARE GO TO SOUP PORT NATIONALS. BACK THAT WAS AGREED TO LAST FALL. THEY CLOSED THE DOOR AGAIN, INTENSIFYING THIS WHOLE CONVERSATION >>. WHAT DOES THAT? TELL US ABOUT LARGER FRUSTRATIONS ABOUT IMMIGRATION POLICIES >>. IT COMES DOWN TO NUMBERS. WE KNOW STUDIES SHOW THAT UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS PER PERSON COMMIT FEWER CRIMES. THERE ARE SO MANY UNDOCUMENTED THAT THERE ARE RECORD SETTERS. IN LAST TWO YEARS, THE NUMBER OF COUNTRIES OF PEOPLE COMING HERE AS IN ADDED. THERE ARE PEOPLE FROM CHINA AND AFRICA. THEIR MOBILE MIGRATION PATTERNS, PATTERNS- WE MARCHED ON THIS BEFORE POLICE- HAVE BEEN ATTACKED.

GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME- IS GAINING POPULARITY BECAUSE WE ARE NOW IN THE ENVIRONMENT WHERE A PERSON WAS TAKING A PICTURE OF THEMSELVES AND STREAMING THEMSELVES IN TRYING TO MAKE SURE THEY HAD A VIRAL MOMENT AND THEY WERE NOT LOOKING AT WHAT THEY ERE DOING. SO THAT IS ONE EFFORT THAT PEOPLE WANT TO BE PART OF THE NEWS AND PART OF THE CELEBRATION, AND THAT IS LEADING TO ISSUES LIKE THIS, WHERE THEY ARE NOT LOOKING AT, WHERE THEY ARE GOING AND NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO PROTECT OTHER PEOPLE >>. WHAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT THIS IS THERE SOMETHING PHYSICAL, LIKE A BARRICADE OR SECURITY. RECENTLY YOU SAID THAT MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST IDEA. WHY IS THAT? >> PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO STORM A SPORT OR A FIELD AND YOU HAVE BARRIERS. THAT COULD CAUSE ISSUES. WHERE YOU COULD HAVE SUFFOCATION, SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU SEE AT ROCK CONCERTS OR OTHER AREAS. WHERE YOU HAVE A BARRIER IN AND INAPPROPRIATE LOCATION. THERE MUCH BETTER STRATEGIES, INCLUDING PROCEDURES FOR STUDENTS INDICATING THAT IF A STORM THE FIELD THEY COULD FACE CONSEQUENCES LIKE FINES, EXPULSION, WHATEVER MIGHT BE. THAT IS WHAT THEY NEED TO TRY TO IMPLEMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT FANS DON'T GET INTO HARMS WAY OR CAUSE TROUBLE FOR THE PLAYERS. >>. WHEN IT COMES TO FINDS. THERE WAS AN EXAMPLE. THEY HAD A $100,000 FINE. DO YOU THINK SCHOOLS ARE RESPONSIBLE? SHOULD IT BE UP TO THE INSTITUTIONS TO HAVE THEM FIND IN THAT WAY? OR DO YOU THINK INDIVIDUALS SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND IF SO, HOW? >> I DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE THE INSTITUTIONS. THE SEC HAD A FINE STRUCTURE IN PLACE FOR YEARS AND IT IS NOT STOPPED ANY INCIDENTS OF FINE. THEY GET FUNDRAISERS TO HELP PAY FOR IT, SO IT DOES NOT STOP THEIR BEHAVIOR. YOU NEED TO HAVE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. IN THE STUDENT CODE OF CONDUCT THAT SAYS LOOK. THIS IS NOT WHAT WE DO AT OUR INSTITUTION. IF YOU ENGAGE IN THIS, WE WILL PUNISH YOU. IT HAS TO BE FOLLOWED UP WITH ACTUAL PUNISHMENT AND THEN FANS WILL GET THE GIST OF IT. WE DON'T SEE IT AT THE PROFESSIONAL LEVEL BECAUSE IT'S A DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT AT THE COLLEGE LEVEL. THEY COULD PREVENT THESE FROM HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE. >>. THAT WILL BE A INTERESTING CONVERSATION. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. >>. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME >>. >>>.

THEY UPHELD THE LAW OR NOT IT OUT. DOES THE FIRST AMENDMENT PROTECT THE COMPANIE? AMENDMENT PROTECT THE COMPANIE FACEBOOK AND YOUTUBE, ETC. FROM CURATING CONTENT? THEY LIKE NEWSPAPERS AND CAN PUBLISH ANYTHING THEY WANT. ARE THEY LIKE THE OLD PHONE COMPANY REQUIRED BY LAW TO CARRY EVERYBODY'S MESSAGE, WHETHER THEY LIKE IT OR NOT? THE IMPLICATION IS: DOES FACEBOOK HAVE THE RIGHT TO NOT HAVE PROPAGANDA, WHICH IT DOES RIGHT? NOW, THIS COULD BE DARK AND DISTURBING >> ACCORDING TO THE ATTORNEY. >>.

SO SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES ARE SO. SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES ARE NOT. IT IS SECTION 130..

HOW COULD THIS IMPACT SOCIAL MEDIA REGULATION AND THE CONTENTS YOU WILL SEE ON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS IN THE FUTURE? AND THIS IS ALL ON THE BACKDROP OF AN ELECTION YEAR >>.

YOU SAID YOU AGRE WITH THE STATE SUPREME COURT DECISION THAT EMBRYOS AR CHILDREN. I WANT TO PUT A FINE POINT O THIS: YOU SUPPORT IVF AS IT IS PRACTICED IN THE UNITED STATES, WHICH INVOLVES THE PRODUCTION OF EMBRYOS THAT ARE SOMETIMES DETROIT, STROYED OR DONATED I THEY ARE UNUSED >>. FIRST, I DO SUPPORT IVF BECAUSE I HAVE SEVERAL FRIENDS THAT HAVE GONE THROUGH THE PROCEDURE. IT HAS MADE THEIR FAMILIES WHOLE. IT HAS ALLOWED THEM TO HAV CHILDREN. THEIR CHILDREN ARE WONDERFUL. I TOTALLY SUPPORT THE PROCEDURE NUMBER TWO. WHEN THE REPORTE ASKED ME THAT QUESTION, I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HALLWAY AND HEARD THE TAIL END OF IT. I DIDN'T HEAR ABOUT THE ALABAM RULING. IT WAS ABOUT. DO I BELIEVE THAT EMBRYOS SHOULD BE PROTECTED? THAT'S WHAT I SAID, BECAUSE I HEARD HALF A QUESTION: DO I SUPPORT THE IVF PROCEDURE 100%? I DO. IT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE AND, AS PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID, WE REALLY WANT THE ALABAM LEGISLATURE. TOSURE THE PROCEDURE IS PROTECTED FROM FAMILIES WHO DO STRUGGLE WITH HAVING CHILDREN. THAT HELPS THEM CREATE GREAT FAMILIES, WHICH IS WHAT OUR COUNTRY DESPERATELY NEEDS. >>. SO JUST TO BE VERY CLEAR, D YOU BELIEVE THAT EMBRYOS ARE PEOPLE? SHOULD THEY BE TREATED AS PEOPLE, WITH ALL OF THE SAME LEGAL RIGHTS? >>. WELL, NOW YOU ARE GETTING INTO A PERSON HOOD ARGUMENT. THIS IS WHERE A LOT OF DETAILS IN LEGISLATION AND COURT RULINGS ARE IMPORTANT. I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT LEGISLATORS HAVE TO MAKE SUR THEY WALK THEMSELVES THROUGH. THE IVF PROCEDURE IS VER IMPORTANT TO A LOT OF COUPLES IN OUR COUNTRY. IT SHOULD BE PROTECTED. I AGREE WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP O THAT. BUT WHEN WE GET INTO THE CONVERSATIONS, IT IS IMPORTANT TO DELINEATE FROM WHAT ONE JUDGE MIGHT SAY VERSUS WHAT LEGISLATURE AND A GOVERNOR WIL DECIDE WHEN THEY GO THROUGH TH LEGISLATIVE PROCESS >>.

FINANCIAL ADVISORS SAY YOU WAN TO WAIT UNTIL 70 BEFORE YOU TAKE THE BENEFIT OVER THE COURSE OF YOUR LIFETIME SHS, YOU WILL EARN MORE. SOCIAL SECURIT IS NOT THE WHOLE PILE OF MONEY YOU SHOULD HAVE.

LAST WEEK WE HAD RECOR HIGHS IN THE STOCK MARKET OVER THE COURSE OF MY CAREER. BETTING AGAINST THE STOCK MARKET HAS BEEN A LOSING BET. THE LONGER YOU ARE INVESTED IS IMPORTANT. IF YOU ARE A YEAR FROM RETIREMENT, YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE 100% OF THE MONEY IN THE STOCK MARKET. YOU NEED TO HAVE ALLOCATIONS THAT REFLECT WHETHER YOU CAN SLEEP AT NIGHT WITH ALL OF THE MONEY. YOU NEED CASH AND REAL ESTAT FOR YOUR PORTFOLIO. YOU CAN SEE THAT YOU HAVE TOOL AND CALCULATORS. IT IS IMPORTANT NOT TO SET I AND FORGET IT OVER TIME. REEVALUATE YOUR GOALS AND IT USED TO BE THAT. YOU HAD A PENSION, SO YOU RETIRE AT 65. AND THEN YOU GOT 60% OF TH SALARY. THAT IS NOT THE WORLD WE ARE LIVING IN NOW. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE HEALTHIE AND THEY WANT TO KEEP WORKING. THEY DON'T HAVE A PENSION, FO 401K. YOU HAVE TO BE PARTICIPATING. I THE 401K PENSION WAS SOMETHING YOU WERE A PART OF AND DIDN'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT. THIS IS A DIFFERENT KIND.

WERE GOING TO GET STARTED WITH THE RACE TO THE WHITE HOUSE. ONE MORE DAY. >>. IN NORTH DAKOTA, 29 DELEGATES ARE UP FOR GRABS. FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IS LOOKING TO INCH CLOSER TO GETTING THE NOMINATION WITH THE WIND. TODAY, HIS RIVAL, NIKKI HALEY, WON HER FIRST CONTEST OF THE PRIMARY SEASON. THEY PROJECTED JEFF UHLER AS THE WINNER. SHE HOPES THIS WILL SPARK SOME MOMENTUM. >>>. THERE WERE WINS FOR FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. OVER THE WEEKEND WE SAT DOWN WITH THINKING HALEY AND SPOKE ABOUT THE STATE OF THE RACE AND WHETHER SHE WOULD SUPPORT TRUMP AS HE BECOMES THE NOMINEE. >>> HELLO, I SPOKE WITH THE FORMER AMBASSADOR NIKKI HALEY. HERE IS WHAT SHE HAD TO SAY ABOUT WHETHER SHE WOULD STAND BY HER PLEDGE TO SUPPORT THE NOMINEE, EVEN IF IT IS DONALD TRUMP. >>. YOU SIGNED A PLEDGE TO SUPPORT THE EVENTUAL NOMINEE. YOU FEEL BOUND BY THAT. >>. I SAID I HAD SERIOUS CONCERNS. I HAVE MORE CONCERNS ABOUT PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. SO IS THAT NO? >> THE RNC PLEDGE WE HAD TO TAKE IT. WHERE WOULD YOU SUPPORT THE NOMINEE TO GET ON THAT STAGE? YOU SAID, YES, NOW IT IS NOT THE SAME RNC. >>. I THINK I WILL MAKE THE DECISION I WANT TO MAKE, BUT THAT'S NOT SOMETHING. I'M THINKING ABOUT WHY YOU ALL THINK ABOUT THAT. I AM LOOKING AT THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN VIRGINIA AND WE ARE GOING TO GO TO VERMONT, MAINE AND ALL THESE STATES TO SHOW PEOPLE THERE IS A PATH FORWARD. I DON'T LOOK AT WHAT IT IS. I WANT TO KNOW HOW WE CAN CONTINUE. >>. YOU CAN GET MORE. MEET THE PRESS HERE ON NBC NEWS NOW, EVERY WEEKDAY AT FOUR PM. >>. OKAY, THANK YOU, IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. LET'S TALK ABOUT NIKKI HALEY, THE FIRST PRIMARY WIN. HOW SIGNIFICANT IS THIS AS WE HEAD INTO SUPER TUESDAY? >>. EXCUSE ME, THE NEXT BEST CHANCE FOR NIKKI HALEY WHEN YOU LOOK AT WASHINGTON. DONALD TRUMP DISMISSED THE FACT THAT SHE WON THERE. I STAY AWAY FROM THAT, BECAUSE IT IS THE SWAMP, WITH YOU DELEGATES, FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP TRYING TO MAKE THE CASE. IT WAS THE INSIDERS THAT WENT NIKKI HALEY. SHE ALSO PICKED UP WINS IN MISSOURI, IDAHO AND MICHIGAN. >>. LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS DEBAT. ONE DOZEN STATES AND 900 DELEGATES. ONE THIRD OF THE DELICATE HALL COMES OUT OF TOMORROW'S ELECTION RESULTS AND BIG PLAYS IN PLACES LIKE CALIFORNIA. IF FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP GETS OVER 50%, YOU WOULD TAKE ALL THE DELEGATES OUT OF CALIFORNIA. WHEN DOES HE ACTUALLY GET THE DELEGATE THRESHOLD TO BECOME THE PRESENTED NOMINEE AND HIT THAT MARK? WE EXPECT IT AS SOON AS MARCH 12, AND IF NOT, THEN IT WILL BE THE 19th, THE POLLING SHOWS FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP DOMINATING. SO FAR. THERE IS NO REASON WHY THAT WILL BE THE CASE TOMORROW. >>. ARKANSAS AND NORTH CAROLINA HAS VOTER ID REQUIREMENTS. ONE OF THESE REQUIREMENTS, AND HOW DO THEY AFFECT THIS? >> YES, EIGHT STATES HAVE NEW VOTER ID LAWS, INCLUDING NORTH CAROLINA AND ARKANSAS. YOU HAVE TO SHOW SOME FORM OF ID. IN THE CASE OF NORTH CAROLINA, IF YOU ARE SENDING IN A MAIL BALLOT, YOU HAVE TO SEND A PHOTO COPY OF YOUR ID ALONG WITH YOUR BALLOT IN THE MAIL. THESE NEW MEASURES ARE GOING INTO EFFECT. 46 STATES HAVE SOME SORT OF VOTER ID REQUIREMENT. REQUIREMENT: >>>. WE HAVE FULL COVERAGE, BEGINNING TOMORROW AT 5:00.. >>>. THE SUPREME COURT COULD DECIDE TODAY IF FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP WILL REMAIN ON THE PRIMARY BALLOT IN COLORADO. HE IS CURRENTLY ON THE BALLOT. AFTER, A HOLD WAS PLACED ON THE RULING TO REMOVE HIM BECAUSE OF HIS EFFORT TO OVERTURN THE ELECTION RESULTS. JUSTICES WILL ARGUMENTS FOR THE END OF APRIL. THE DECISION COULD HAVE FAR-REACHING IMPLICATIONS FOR OTHER CHARGES. WE'RE JOINED NOW BY SANDY GRANTED. DECISION IS EXPECTED TODAY AS TO WHETHER HE SHOULD BE INCLUDED. TAKE US BACK TO THE ORAL ARGUMENTS. JUSTICES SEEM SKEPTICAL THAT A. JUSTICES SEEM SKEPTICAL THAT A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE COULD BE OFF ESTATE THE BALLOT. AND JUST AS THEY PREDICTED, WE SEE DIFFERENT CHALLENGES THAT ARE VERY DIFFERENT. SOME ARE ADMINISTRATIVELY DONE THROUGH THE SECRETARY OF STATE. SO THE JUSTICES HAVE A LOT OF ISSUES BEFORE THEM AND THE CHALLENGERS, THOSE THAT WANT TO KEEP TRUMP OFF THE BALLOT, HAVE TO HAVE A LOT OF THINGS GO RIGHT FOR THEM. IT REALLY SEEMS THE JUSTICES ONLY NEED TO CONCLUDE THAT ANY OF THE CHALLENGERS POSITIONS ARE WRONG AND TRUMP STAYS ON THE BALLOT. IF YOU'RE BETTING, THE ODDS ARE THAT TRUMP WILL STAY ON ALL OF THE BALLOTS >>. THE JUSTICES HAVE ALSO RAISED ARGUMENTS OVER PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY. PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY- HOW, LIKELY, IS THE HIGH COURT TO ADJUST THIS? IS THIS DELAY ALONE A WIN FOR THE FORMER PRESIDENT? >>? IF THIS WERE A NORMAL CASE, YOU MIGHT THINK HESE SUPREME COURT WOULD NOT HAVE TAKEN THIS UP. YEAH, THE ISSUE AT THE DISTRICT COURT GOING ONE WAY, AND THEN THE EXACT SAME WAY AS THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS. NO IMMUNITY. ORDINARILY, YOU WOULD THINK THAT, ORDINARILY, YOU WOULD THINK THAT THIS REQUEST FOR THE COURT WOULD BE DENIED, BECAUSE THERE IS REALLY NOTHING FOR THEM TO TAKE ON NORMALLY. YOU HAVE THE CIRCUIT COURT OR SOME REASON, A PATCHWORK LAW THAT INTERESTS THE COURT. THIS IS AN ISSUE OF MONUMENTAL IMPORTANCE. WHAT IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN. EVEN THOUGH THEY PUT NO ORDER. IT IS NO INDICATION ABOUT HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT THE MERIT OF THE CASE. YOU TAKE THAT HOW YOU WILL, IN SHORT ORDER. HOW ARE THEY LIKELY TO RULE? >> WHO KNOWS? IN TERMS OF CREATING A DELAY, THE TEAM HAS SUCCEEDED BECAUSE IT IS MORE TIME ADDED ON. IT'S MORE AND MORE DIFFICULT TO HAVE A TRIAL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ELECTION >>. ONE CASE THAT COULD BE IMPACTED BY THIS DECISION IS THE CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS CASE AND DOCUMENTS FOUND AT MAR-A LAGO. THERE IS NOT A NEW TRIAL DATE. PROSECUTORS WANT TO START IN JULY. TRUMP'S ATTORNEYS WANT TO DELAY IT UNTIL AT LEAST AUGUST. WHAT HAPPENS AS THEY ARGUE OVER A START DATE >>? IT'S A FEDERAL CASE. IF YOU'RE GOING TO TRIAL WITHIN A MATTER OF MONTHS AND IF YOU HAVE AN UNUSUALLY COMPLEX CASE, YOU CAN STRETCH THAT OUT. THE GOVERNMENT DISAGREES WITH THE NOTION THAT IT'S COMPLICATED. IT IS UNCOMPLICATED. THE ISSUES ARE GOING TO BE THINGS THAT WE HAVE NEVER LOOKED AT BEFORE. EVEN IN FEDERAL COURT, THESE CASES ARE MOVING. THE TRIALS WILL GO ON THROUGH 20/25.. EVERYONE THOUGHT I WAS NUTS NOW MAYBE I WAS NOT SO NUTS. >>. ONE MORE CASE TO TALK ABOUT THE GEORGIA ELECTION INTERFERENCE CASE >>. Reporter. FRIDAY: A JUDGE SAID HE EXPECTED EVIDENCE IN ABOUT TWO WEEKS. SO WHAT IS AT STAKE? >>. THE ANSWER IS: AFTER THE ARGUMENTS. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT ARGUMENTS. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE STANDARD IS FOR REMOVAL. IS IT THE APPEARANCE OF IMPROPRIETY? DO YOU NEED AN ACTUAL CONFLICT, SOMETHING THAT AFFECTS THE PROSECUTION OF THE CASE? THESE THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON BETWEEN THE DISTRICT ATTORNEYS HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE DEFENDANTS. THE JUDGE IS INSCRUTABLE. IT'S HARD TO TELL WHICH WAY HE IS GOING. THE STANDARD HERE IS GOING TO BE EASY. THEN, WHAT HAPPENS TO THE CASE? NOTHING HAPPENS TO THE UNDERLYING PROSECUTION. A NEW PROSECUTOR COULD WALK IN AND TAKE OVER THE CASE, AS A POLITICAL ANALYST WILL TELL YOU. POLITICALLY, IT IS A DISASTER. WHO ELSE BUT THE DA WANTS TO STEP IN AND TAKE ON A CASE THAT MAY HAVE BEEN MORTALLY WOUNDED BY THIS MOTION TO DISQUALIFY >>. OKAY, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. >>>. A CEASE-FIRE HOSTAGE DEAL. A DELEGATION IS IN CAIRO FOR NEGOTIATIONS AFTER OFFICIALS SAID ISRAEL HAD ACCEPTED THIS FRAMEWORK. THIS IS, AFTER THE US CARRIED OUT THE FIRST DAY. DROP OVER GAZA ON SATURDAY IS A JOINT EFFORT, A QUARTER OF THE POPULATION IS STARVING. IN SELMA, KAMALA HARRIS BROUGHT UP THE SITUATION AND CALLED FOR A CEASE-FIRE. THIS IS THE STRONGEST COMMENT YET AND SHE CALLED. THOSE CONDITIONS ARE ABLE >>. WHAT WE ARE SEEING EVERY DAY IN GAZA IS DEVASTATING. WE HAVE SEEN REPORTS OF FAMILIES EATING LEAVES OR ANIMAL FECES. WOMEN GAVE BIRTH TO MALNOURISHED BABIES WITH LITTLE OR NO MEDICAL CARE. CHILDREN ARE DYING FROM OUT ATTRITION AND DEHYDRATION. ISRAELI GOVERNMENTS MUST DO MORE TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE FLOW OF AID. THERE ARE NO EXCUSES. THEY MUST OPEN NEW BORDER CROSSINGS. THEY MUST NOT IMPOSE UNNECESSARY RESTRICTIONS ON THE DELIVERY OF AID. >>. NOW, ALLIE RAFF, I IS JOINING US. GOOD MORNING TO BOTH OF YOU, MEGAN, LET'S START WITH YOU, ONE OF THE LATEST ON THE TALKS. >>. BOTH EGYPT AND THE US HAVE SAID THESE NEGOTIATIONS ARE [ INAUDIBLE ]. US OFFICIALS SAY ISRAEL HAS AGREED TO THE PROPOSAL BUT IS OFF THE TABLE. RIGHT NOW. THEY ARE OPTIMISTIC THAT A DEAL CAN BE REACHED BY THE BEGINNING OF RAMADAN. HERE IS WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THIS POTENTIAL DEAL. IT STAYS AROUND AND ALLOWS FOR MORE HUMANITARIAN AID TO REACH THE ENCLAVE. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THERE COULD BE THE RELEASE OF HOSTAGES AND SOME PALESTINIAN PRISONERS. OFFICIALS ALLISON MAASS HAS NOT YET PROVIDED A LIST OF WHICH HOSTAGES REMAIN ALIVE. THEY SAY THAT IS A KEY ISSUE AT THIS MOMENT. A AGREEMENT HAS NOT BEEN MADE. >>. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE SPEECH FROM HARRIS. WHAT DID WE HEAR FROM HER? >>. Reporter. THE VICE PRESIDENT WAS IN SELMA, ALABAMA, TO COMMEMORATE THE 50th ANNIVERSARY OF RUSH. SUNDAY WHILE SHE WAS THERE, SHE [ INAUDIBLE ] IN ITS WAR WITH HAMAS. SHE TALKED ABOUT HOW DIRE. THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS HAS BECOME AN ISRAEL IS CALLED UPON TO DO MORE, AND THIS COMES AFTER. WE SAW THE FIRST DELIVERY OF US AIR DROPS, IN COOPERATION AND COORDINATION WITH THE JORDANIAN AIR FORCE, WHO DELIVERED 40,000 READY TO EAT MEALS OVER THE COASTLINE. SATURDAY VICE PRESIDENT. HERE IS ALSO URGED ISRAEL TO OPEN MORE LAND. IT TUNNELS AFTER WE NOTE TO BORDER CROSSINGS ARE OPEN. THAT AID HAS BEEN BOTTLENECKED. THEY DOUBLE DOWN ON THE ADMINISTRATIONS, CALL FOR MORE OF HUMANITARIAN AID AND THE RELIEF OF HOSTAGES. >>. GIVEN THE IMMENSE SCALE OF SUFFERING IN GAZA, THERE MUST BE AN IMMEDIATE CEASE-FIRE. HUMAS CLAIMS IT WANTS TO SEE FIVE. THERE'S A DEAL ON THE TABLE, AS WE HAVE SAID. HUMAS NEEDS TO AGREE TO THAT DEAL. >>. Reporter. COMMENTS COME AT A CRITICAL TIME. THERE ARE CRITICAL CEASE-FIRE TALKS IN CAIRO. THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION IS WATCHING THEM VERY CLOSELY. >>. OKAY, NOW WE HAVE LEARNED TO. SIX MONTH-OLD TWINS WERE AMONG THOSE KILLED IN AN AIRSTRIKE YESTERDAY. WHAT MORE CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THAT? >>. Reporter. THAT'S A DIFFERENT STORY. COMING OUT OF GOSSIP AND ISRAELI ATTACK KILLED 19.. AMONG THOSE KILLED, A SIX-MONTH-OLD PAIR OF TWINS ARE SEEN ON THE GROUND. THE MOTHER SAID SHE LOST HER TWINS AND HER HUSBAND AND KEPT REPEATING: WHO WILL CALL HER MOM? >>. SHE HAD BEEN TRYING TO HAVE CHILDREN FOR MANY YEARS. WE ALSO SPOKE TO A MAN WHO SAID HE LOST 30 MEMBERS OF HIS FAMILY. >> IT'S HEARTBREAKING. WE KNOW. KAMALA HARRIS IS AT THE TABLE AGAIN. WE UNDERSTAND, SHE IS MAKING THE VISIT. WHAT IS GOING ON HERE? >>. Reporter. THIS IS A POLITICAL >>. Reporter, THIS IS A POLITICAL RIVAL OF BENJAMIN, NOT YAHOO. WE UNDERSTAND, HE IS GOING TO BE LAUNCHING THIS FOR A FEW DAYS AND HE WILL BE WITH ANTHONY LINCOLN AND JEFF SULLIVAN AND LAWMAKERS ON CAPITOL HILL TO TALK ABOUT NOT JUST THE WAR IN GAZA BUT HOW TO EASE THE HUMANITARIAN SUFFERING THERE, AND TALK ABOUT PLANS FOR WHAT THE DAY AFTER THE WAR WILL LOOK LIKE AS FAR AS SECURITY AND A GOVERNING SYSTEM. SO THAT'S MORE IS TO COME OUT OF THIS WORK. >>. OKAY, WE APPRECIATE THAT. NEWCOMBE. NOW LET'S GO TO CALIFORNIA. IT'S THE BIGGEST SNOWSTORM OF THE SEASON THAT HAS COME THROUGH THE SIERRA. NEVADA REGION, REGION- SNOW TOTALS CONTINUE. THERE WAS HEAVY SNOW AND SOME WIND GUSTS. AT TIMES THE RATE OF SNOWFALL WAS MORE THAN THREE INCHES OF SNOW EVERY HOUR. THAT IS LIFE-THREATENING WHITE OUT CONDITIONS. INTERSTATE 80 WAS SHUT DOWN. WE HAVE THE LATEST GOOD MORNING. HOW ARE THINGS WHERE YOU ARE? >>. >>. Reporter. IT IS MIRACULOUS. I HAVE BEEN OUT HERE ONE HOUR AND THIS IS THE LEAST AMOUNT OF SNOW WE HAVE BEEN SINCE WE HAVE BEEN ON THE GROUND. THAT TRAIN IS VERY LOUD. THIS IS BEEN A CONTINUOUS SNOWFALL SITUATION SINCE THURSDAY NIGHT, SATURDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT. THREE TO FIVE INCHES EVERY HOUR. AT ONE POINT THERE WAS AN EXPANSE OF 300 MILES OF BLIZZARD WARNINGS. THE FACT THAT WE ARE GETTING A BREAK- WE ARE. IT IS BEING REPLACED BY ANOTHER STORM SYSTEM. RIGHT NOW IT'S A REPRIEVE FOR RESIDENTS. INTERSTATE 80 IS TILL SHUT DOWN FOR ABOUT 100 MILES. AS WE MENTIONED, THE SNOW WAS INTENSE. THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL SAID IT HAD NO ESTIMATED TIME FOR IT TO REOPEN. WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THAT AND WHAT ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO DEPEND ON THAT ARTERY? >>. THIS IS THE WORST SITUATION. SOME PEOPLE HAD TO LEAVE THEIR CARS ON THE HIGHWAY AND THEY WERE BEING RESCUED. BECAUSE OF THE BLINDING WHITE OUT CONDITIONS, VISIBILITY WAS NEXT TO ZERO. THEY HAD TO MAKE A DECISION. THAT IS THE MAJOR THOROUGHFARE AND THE THING THAT CONNECTS COMMUNITIES IN THIS MOUNTAIN REGION. YOU WOULD HAVE TO GO AROUND THE LAKE TAHOE, OTHERWISE, TO GET TO WHERE YOU ARE GOING. PEOPLE WERE CAUGHT UP IN THIS. I SPOKE TO ONE WOMAN WHO SAID SHE WAS EXPECTING SOME SNOW BUT THEY GOT THAT HUGE STORM AND IT WAS UNEXPECTED >>. WE DEFINITELY THOUGHT IT WAS A LITTLE BIT. TOO MUCH HYPE. AND THEN, FRIDAY NIGHT, WHEN WE WENT DOWNTOWN, IT WAS DEFINITELY A BLIZZARD. WE WOKE UP TO A LOT OF SNOW YESTERDAY. WE WENT FROM ZERO TO 100 PRETTY QUICKLY >>. PEOPLE HERE ARE HARDY AND THEY DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE MEDIA, WHEN THEY SAY IT'S GOING TO BE A BAD SNOW. PEOPLE WERE CAUGHT OFF GUARD BY HOW MUCH SNOW WE GOT WORK >> IN THERE IS MORE ON THE WAY >>. ANOTHER SNOWSTORM TODAY. HOW ARE PEOPLE PREPARING FOR THAT? >> FIRST, I THINK PEOPLE HERE KNOW WHAT TO DO. WE HAVE ALREADY FACED THE WORST STORM OF THE SEASON AND LIKELY TO BE THE WORST STORM ALL YEAR, AND WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A BIG ROAD CLOSURE. WHETHER THEY GET MORE SNOW ONE OR TWO FEET. AS EARLY AS THIS AFTERNOON, IT WILL PROBABLY BE JUST A FEW INCHES. IN OTHER COMMUNITIES NOBODY WANTS TO SEE IT, BUT PEOPLE ARE PREPARED FOR IT WORK. CREWS HAVE BEEN OUT FOR 24 HOURS. MINIMUM A LITTLE MORE IS NOTHING >>>. NOW LET'S BRING IN MICHELLE TO GIVE US THE FORECAST >>> IT'S CRAZY. SOME SPOTS GOT OVER 40 INCHES OF SNOW IN 24 HOURS. WERE GOING TO ADD A COUPLE MORE FEET. WE DO HAVE WINTER ALERTS THIS MORNING AND THIS WILL GO THROUGH WEDNESDAY, WITH BLOWING SNOW AND BLIZZARD CONDITIONS- REALLY COLD AND THE WIND WILL BE IN THERE AS WELL. THEN ON THE COAST, WE GET SOME RAIN. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE DAY. THIS BRINGS THE IMPACT THROUGH WEDNESDAY WITH HEAVY RAIN AND MORE SNOW. FOR NORTHERN CALIFORNIA, THROUGH TOMORROW, THE HEAVIEST SNOW WILL BE CONFINED TO THE SIERRA NEVADA. THEN WE WILL SEE RAIN INCREASING. FOR THE COASTAL AREAS IT'S SATURATED, THEY ARE, SO WE COULD HAVE SOME FLOODING. BY WEDNESDAY, SNOW SHOWERS DECREASE, IMPROVING CONDITIONS. WE WILL SEE THIS SYSTEM SINK TO THE SOUTH. THE HEAVIEST SNOW WILL BE AT THE HIGHEST ELEVATIONS AND LOWER ELEVATIONS WILL SEE, IF YOU. INCHES OF SNOW THEN WENT TO THREE INCHES OF RAIN FROM WASHINGTON DOWN TO CALIFORNIA, ESPECIALLY ALONG THE COAST. ALSO A LOT OF RAIN IN PORTIONS OF THE EAST. TODAY, WE WILL SEE THIS SYSTEM MOVED TO THE EAST THAT BRINGS THE CHANCE FOR RAIN FROM THE PLANES ALL THE WAY INTO THE MIDWEST, ON THE NORTHERN PART OF THIS, WHERE YOU SEE THE BLUE SOME. WHERE YOU SEE THE BLUE SOME SNOW ALONG THE GREAT LAKES AND WE WILL SEE POCKETS OF HEAVY RAIN AND THE THREAT FOR SEVERE WEATHER. TODAY AND TOMORROW, RAIN CHANCES RETURN TO THE NORTHEAST AND WE KEEP THE RAIN IN THE FORECAST FOR COUPLE OF DAYS. TODAY, WIND GUSTING 60 MILES PER HOUR. LARGE HAIL AS WELL, THIS GREEN AREA IS LIKELY TO GET HEAD. CHICAGO COULD SEE THUNDERSTORMS TODAY, A THREAT FOR LITTLE ROCK AND HONOR NEW ORLEANS. WE COULD SEE SOME ALE AND A TORNADO. THREAT TO ANOTHER BIG STORY IS IT WARM CONDITIONS, TEMPERATURES INTO THE 70s. LOOK AT BUFFALO: 36 DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL, NORMAL ST LOUIS IS 79 AND SPRINGLIKE WEATHER WILL BE IN THE FORECAST AS WE LOOK AT TEMPERATURES WELL, ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES: 40 DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL. PITTSBURGH IS 73 AND CHARLESTON 77.. >> SPRING BREAK IN BUFFALO. >> I KNOW. >>> LATER THIS OUR CONTROVERSY ON CAMPUS. WE WILL TAKE IT TO FLORIDA, WHERE UNIVERSITIES HAVE TO CUT AI PROGRAMS. >> WE GO TO THE SOUTHERN BORDER. >>> WE ARE BACK WITH A CLOSER. >>> WE ARE BACK WITH A CLOSER. LOOK AT THE BATTLE OVER THE SOUTHERN BORDER AND HOW THAT ISSUE WILL GO TO YOUR HIGH STAKES ELECTION.

HIS SPIKE IN LEGAL BORDER CROSSING GOES INCREASE MIGRATION ACROSS THE WORLD. HE OFFERS A SOLUTION, BUT REPUBLICANS ARE BLOCKING IT >>. TO SHUT DOWN THE BORDER, THE US WOULD NEED MEXICO TO TAKE BACK MORE MIGRANTS. THEN FORMALLY AGREED TO. THERE IS ALSO CONSIDERATION FOR EXECUTIVE ACTION, MAKING IT HARDER FOR ASYLUM. IF THAT HAPPENS, ADVOCATES ARE WORRIED. THE PROCESS WILL BECOME EVEN MORE DANGEROUS >>. THESE ARE PEOPLE'S LIVES AND FUTURES THAT WE ARE PLAYING WITH. WE SHOULD NEVER USE THAT FOR POLITICAL GAIN. DHS OFFICIALS TELL US THAT, UNLESS CONGRESS TAKES ACTION, THERE IS A FORECAST OF A SHORTFALL OF MORE THAN HALF $1 BILLION >>>. WE STARTED IN UKRAINE. NOW THERE IS A DEAF CALL FOR A RUSSIAN DRONE ATTACKED. CLAUDIA JOINS US FOR THAT AND OTHER WORLD NEWS >>. YES, GOOD MORNING. 12 PEOPLE, INCLUDING FIVE CHILDREN, WERE KILLED.

IN THE MIDDLE EAST, GLOBAL PRESSURE RAMPING UP FOR A CEASE- FIRE. IN GAZA, AND THE US HAS STARTED A RISKY WARTIME OPERATION, DROPPING MUCH NEEDED HUMANITARIAN AID TO MILLIONS OF STARVING PALESTINIANS. THIS COMES AS THE VICE. PRESIDENT TAKES THIS STANCE ON.

Reporter. THIS STORM WAS MASSIV FS, THE ONE THAT WAS IN FRONT OF FS. THE ONE THAT WAS IN FRONT OF THEM, RIGHT NOW. BUT OTHER STATES HAD TRIED TO BAN HIM FROM THE BALLOT, INCLUDING MAINE AND ILLINOIS. WITH THE COURT DOING THIS RIGHT NOW, THOSE, ESSENTIALLY, WILL ALSO BE WIPED AWAY, CRAIG >>. AND AGAIN, AS YOU POINT OUT A UNANIMOUS DECISION- NOT SOMETHING. WE SEE VERY FREQUENTLY FROM THE SUPREME COURT THESE DAYS. THERE WERE TWO QUESTIONS AT HAND. YOU HAD MENTIONED, OF COURSE, THE CLAUSE IN THE 14th AMENDMENT BUT THERE WAS ALSO THE QUESTION OF WHO ACTUALLY GETS TO DECIDE WHO WAS ENGAGED IN AN INSURRECTION IN THIS COUNTRY >>. YES, AND DONALD TRUMP'S ATTORNEYS HAD ESSENTIALLY TRIED TO CONVINCE THE COURT- SUCCESSFULLY HERE- THAT THIS WAS FOR CONGRESS TO DECIDE, NOT JUST ANY ONE STATE COULD SORT OF UNILATERALLY TAKE SOMEBODY OFF A BALLOT IN A NATIONAL ELECTION. THAT WAS SOMETHING. THAT THE JUSTICES WERE VERY INTERESTED IN AT ORAL ARGUMENTS, SOMETHING THAT THEY APPEARED DEEPLY SKEPTICAL OF THE COLORADO VOTERS IN THIS CASE TRYING TO DO THAT, AND OBVIOUSLY TRUMP'S POSITION PREVAILED IN THIS CASE >>. SO THIS DOES NOW MEAN THAT THE OUTSTANDING BALLOT CHALLENGES HAVE BEEN DONE AWAY WITH >>. YES, REMEMBER, THERE WERE DOZENS AND DOZENS OF LAWSUITS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. SOME COURTS TRIED TO DODGE THE ISSUE. SOME COURTS HAD RULED IN TRUMP'S FAVOR, SAYING STATES DIDN'T HAVE THE POWER TO DO THIS. COLORADO WAS THE FIRST ONE WHO HAD TAKEN THAT UNPRECEDENTED STEP IN TRYING TO BAN HIM. TWO OTHERS FOLLOWED, ILLINOIS AND MAINE, AND NOW THOSE WILL NO LONGER HOLD. >>. YOU'RE NOT TERRIBLY SURPRISED. IT SEEMED AS IF THE JUSTICES WERE OPENLY SKEPTICAL. WHEN THOSE ORAL ARGUMENTS WERE MADE ROUGHLY A MONTH AGO >> THEY WERE YOU REMEMBER HOW THIS ALL STARTED? WAS BY VOTERS. THIS WAS SORT OF A PROJECT THAT WAS STARTED AT ITS INCEPTION WITH A LIBERAL THINK TANK GROUP THAT WAS TRYING TO SEE IF THEY COULD DISQUALIFY THE FORMER PRESIDENT. THEY STARTED A STATE BY STATE. EFFORT ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHICH STATES WOULD BE MOST RECEPTIVE TO IT. IT WASN'T JUST PROGRESSIVES WHO WERE THINKING THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO THIS SUCCESSFULLY. THERE WERE A NUMBER OF OUTSPOKEN REPUBLICANS AND OTHER CONSERVATIVES WHO HAD TRIED TO MAKE THIS ARGUMENT AND SAY, IF YOU LOOK AT JUST THE PLAIN TEXT OF THE 14th AMENDMENT, HE SHOULD BE BANNED AGAIN. WE'RE GOING TO WORK OUR WAY THROUGH THE DECISION AND SEE EXACTLY HOW THE COURTS DISPENSE WITH THAT. >>. I'LL TURN MY ATTENTION TO YOU, MR HILLIARD. YOU'VE BEEN SPENDING A FAIR AMOUNT OF TIME OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS- ACTUALLY PAST FEW YEARS- COVERING THE FORMER PRESIDENT. WHAT DO WE EXPECT TO HEAR FROM HIM WHEN HE DOES MAKE SOME REMARKS WITH REGARDS TO HAD WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM THE SUPREME COURT >>. RIGHT DONALD TRUMP IS AT HIS MAR-A-LAGO ESTATE IN WEST PALM BEACH. RIGHT NOW. WE SAW IN THE MINUTES AFTER THE ORAL ARGUMENTS IN FRONT OF THE SUPREME COURT A MONTH AGO HIM GO AND ADDRESS CAMERAS RESPONDING TO IT, CALLING IT A BEAUTIFUL PROCESS THAT HE WATCHED PLAY OUT AT THE SUPREME COURT. THE BIGGEST REALITY HERE THIS MORNING IS THAT AMERICANS SHOULD EXPECT DONALD TRUMP TO BE ON THE GENERAL ELECTION BALLOT FOR THE WHITE HOUSE THIS NOVEMBER. HE IS WELL ON HIS WAY TO BEATING NIKKI HALEY FOR THE GOP NOMINATION. HE COULD WRAP IT UP AS SOON AS MARCH 12th OR EVEN MARCH 19th AND OTHER ATTEMPTS TO KEEP HIM OFF THE BALLOT FAILED. LAURA MENTIONED CONGRESS AND THE SUPREME COURT SUGGESTING IT'S UP TO CONGRESS TO DETERMINE WHETHER HE HAD ENGAGED IN INSURRECTION. FOLKS WILL RECALL IN THE WEEKS AFTER THE JANUARY 6th ATTACK, WHEN DONALD TRUMP HAD LEFT THE WHITE HOUSE, THAT THE US HOUSE VOTED TO IN FACT IMPEACH DONALD TRUMP ON INSURRECTION CHARGES BUT THEN THE US SENATE CAME A FEW VOTES SHORT OF VOTING TO CONVICT HIM. SEVEN REPUBLICANS VOTED TO CONVICT HIM DURING THOSE PROCEEDINGS BUT IT TOOK TWO-THIRDS OF THE SENATE TO ACTUALLY BAR HIM FROM EVER BEING ABLE TO SERVE IN THE WHITE HOUSE. AGAIN, IN ANOTHER ARGUMENT FROM TRUMP'S ATTORNEYS IN FRONT OF THE US SUPREME COURT, WAS THE FACT THAT THE SPECIAL COUNSEL, JACK SMITH, WHO IS THE ONE WHO CHARGED DONALD TRUMP WITH THOSE FELONIES STEMMING FROM THE EFFORTS TO OVERTURN THE 2020 ELECTION- JACK SMITH, THE SPECIAL COUNSEL, NEVER ACTUALLY CHARGED HIM ON FELONY INSURRECTION CHARGES, WHICH AGAIN HITS AT THE HEART OF -- FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES- DONALD TRUMP. AS LONG AS HE WRAPS UP THIS GOP NOMINATION, THE EFFORTS TO KEEP HIM FROM THE BALLOT IN NOVEMBER ARE ALL BUT OVER NOW >>. VAUGHN, STAND BY FOR JUST A MOMENT. NOW I WANT TO COME BACK TO YOU. I WANT TO BRING IN CAROL LAM, A FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR, SHE'S ALSO AN NBC NEWS LEGAL ANALYST, AS MY FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE, LAURA JARRETT POINTED OUT A FEW MOMENTS AGO. A NAMES DECISION HERE, SOMEWHAT UNCOMMON. WHAT HAVE WE BEEN ABLE TO GLEAN FROM SIFTING THROUGH THIS ORDER? ANYTHING FROM THE LIBERAL JUSTICES, THE MORE LIBERAL JUSTICES SPECIFICALLY >> THE THREE LIBERAL JUSTICES DID WRITE A CONCURRENCE, WHERE THEY ESSENTIALLY SAID: WE AGREE WITH THE GENERAL RULING THAT COLORADO CANNOT BY ITSELF DEPART FROM THE REST OF THE NATION IN TAKING DONALD TRUMP OFF THE BALLOT. BUT THEY SAID THAT THE COURT WENT FURTHER THAN IT HAD TO, AND THIS IS A PRINCIPLE OF JUDICIAL RESTRAINT THAT THEY'RE ADVOCATING. THEY SAID. YOU SAID ENOUGH. YOU SAID THAT TRUMP CAN'T BE ON THE BALLOT, THAT COLORADO CAN'T DECIDE FOR ITSELF NOT TO PUT ITSELF ON THE BALLOT. BUT YOU WENT FURTHER AND SAID IT'S CONGRESS WHO REALLY DICTATES WHO CAN BE REMOVED FROM CONSIDERATION BECAUSE HE IS A SO-CALLED INSURRECTIONIST. THEY SAID YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO GO THERE. THAT WAS FARTHER THAN JUDICIAL RESTRAINT PERMITS YOU TO GO, AND THEY'RE CRITICAL OF THE MAJORITY OPINION FOR THAT REASON. I WILL ALSO NOTE THAT JUSTICE BARRETT- TIN BARRETT- TYPICALLY CONSIDERED A CONSERVATIVE JUSTICE EMPHASIZE INSTEAD A SEPARATE CONCURRENCE, THAT THIS WAS A UNANIMOUS OPINION OF THE COURT. AND SHE SAID THAT IS THE MESSAGE THAT THE NATION SHOULD TAKE AWAY FROM THIS, THAT WE CAN DECIDE THESE CASES IN A MINUTE, PLEASEUNANIMO. >>. STAND BY FOR ME IF YOU WILL. NBC NEWS LEGAL ANALYST, CATHERINE CHRISTIAN, IS ALSO WITH US NOW. CATHERINE IS A FORMER ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN THE MANHATTAN DA'S OFFICE. THANKS FOR YOUR TIME THIS MORNING. THROUGHOUT THE ARGUMENT IT REALLY DID SEEM TO FOLKS WHO ARE WATCHING AND LISTENING THAT THE JUSTICES DIDN'T REALLY SPEND A FAIR AMOUNT OF TIME FOCUSING ON ONE OF THE CENTRAL QUESTIONS HERE IN THIS CASE: WHETHER THE FORMER PRESIDENT ACTUALLY PARTICIPATED IN AN INSURRECTION. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT PART OF THIS? >> THEY CLEARLY DID NOT WANT TO GO THERE. IT'S --. YOU KNOW THE STATEMENT THAT THE -- AT THE END OF THE DECISION, ALL NINE MEMBERS OF THE COURT AGREE WITH THE RESULT. THE RESULT THAT SECTION 3 RESTS WITH CONGRESS AND NOT THE STATE. THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT. THAT IT WAS UNANIMOUS, SO YOU CAN'T SAY IT WAS. YOU KNOW 7-2, 5-4.. EVERYONE WAS ON THE SAME PAGE AS TO THE RESULT. AS CAROL SAID, SOME OF THE MORE LIBERAL JUSTICES HAD A LITTLE QUIBBLE BUT THEY AGREE WITH THE RESULT THAT COLORADO, ON ITS OWN, CAN'T DO THAT. NO STATE IN THE UNITED STATES CAN DO THAT. SO I THINK THEY DELIBERATELY ALL NAN NINE OF THEM- REALLY WANTED STY AWAY FROM INSURRECTION, VERSUS NOT DOING AN INSURRECTION. >>. STAND BY FOR ME, AS WELL. I WANT TO BRING VAUGHN BACK INTO THE CONVERSATION. PERHAPS, UNSURPRISEINGLY, WE DO HAVE A STATEMENT NOW FROM THE FORMER PRESIDENT ON THE HEELS OF THIS UNANIMOUS SUPREME COURT DECISION. WHAT'S HE SAYING ABOUT THIS? >> IT'S A SHORT ONE CREATION QUOTE. BIG WIN FOR AMERICA. ALL CAPS ON HIS SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNT AGAIN. DONALD TRUMP IS IN MAR-A-LAGO AHEAD OF SUPER TUESDAY. WE COULD EXPECT HIM TO GO AND MAKE STATEMENTS HERE TODAY, AS HE DID. AFTER THOSE ORAL ARGUMENTS WENT BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT, IN WHICH HE ADDRESSED CAMERAS AND SUGGESTED THIS WAS ALL PART OF DEMOCRATIC EFFORTS TO TRY TO KEEP HIM OFF OF THE BALLOT AND TRY TO DISENFRANCHISE IN HIS WORDS. MILLIONS OF REPUBLICAN VOTERS HERE AROUND THE COUNTRY NOW, AS FOR THOSE REPUBLICAN VOTES, THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE THE SHOT NOT ONLY IN COLORADO BUT THOSE OTHER 15 STATES FOR SUPER TUESDAY TOMORROW, FOR VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP, IF THEY SO CHOOSE TO, AND QUITE LIKELY COME THE GENERAL ELECTION. IF DONALD TRUMP DOES IN FACT BECOME THE PRESUMPTIVE NOMINEE, WE COULD EXPECT TO SEE HIM ON THE BALLOT FOR DONALD TRUMP. MAKING THAT CASE, THAT THERE ARE EFFORTS TO TAKE AWAY THE OPPORTUNITY FOR HIM TO BE AT THE WHITE HOUSE, HAS BEEN AT THE CORE OF HIS 2024 PRESIDENTIAL RUN >>. YOU SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF TIME COVERING THE FORMER PRESIDENT WHEN HE WAS IN OFFICE AND SINCE HE'S BEEN A CANDIDATE AS WELL, THE REALITY IS, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF SAVE WASHINGTON DC THIS WEEKEND, NONE OF THE PRESIDENT'S LEGAL PROBLEMS SO FAR APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN -- TO HAVE ANY SORT OF EFFECT ON HIM. POLITICALLY. FAIR TO SAY. >>. FAIR TO SAY, AND WE'VE SEEN THE REPUBLICANS WHO WERE AT ONE POINT RUNNING AGAINST HIM ONE YEAR AGO. IT WAS A YEAR AGO, MARCH, WHEN THAT FIRST INDICTMENT CAME DOWN STEMMING FROM THE ALLEGED HUSH MONEY PAYMENTS AND THE CRIMINAL TRIAL THAT HE FACES, WHICH IS SLATED TO BEGIN ON MARCH 25th, JUST THREE WEEKS FROM NOW. IT WAS THE REPUBLICANS THAT WERE RUNNING AGAINST HIM, THAT LINED UP IN HIS DEFENSE EVEN AROUND THESE SUPREME COURT ARGUMENTS. IT WAS AGAIN REPUBLICANS, FROM RON DeSANTIS TO NIKKI HALEY TO MIKE PENCE, WHO, AGAIN WERE ARGUING THAT DONALD TRUMP SHOULD REMAIN ON THE BALLOT AND HAVE COME TO HIS DEFENSE LARGELY. WE HAVE SEEN REPUBLICAN VOTERS, MILLIONS OF REPUBLICAN VOTERS, COME TO HIS DEFENSE AT THE BALLOT BOX. THIS SPRING >>. LET'S PAUSE THE POLITICAL AND TURN BACK TO THE LEGAL ANALYST. I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO SIFT THROUGH THIS A LITTLE MORE ANYTHING JUMP OUT AT OWYOU >>. THE COURT SEEMED CONCERNED WITH THIS PATCHWORK OF RULINGS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THAT'S WHY THE COURT, FOR ALL NINE MEMBERS, DECIDED COLORADO CAN'T DO. THIS IS- AND SOME OF THE PROGRESSIVES ON THE COURT ARE CONCERNED- THAT THE COURT WENT FURTHER THAN IT NEEDS TO. WE SHOULD NOTE THIS IS NOT THE LAST WORD WE WILL HEAR FROM THESE JUSTICES, THIS TERM, WHEN IT COMES TO THE FORMER PRESIDENT. THEY HAVE AN ENORMOUS ISSUE ON THEIR PLATE: >> IMMUNITY >>, IMMUNITY >> AND, IN THAT CASE AGAIN. HIS ACTS LEADING UP TO JANUARY 6th ARE GOING TO BE AT THE HEART OF THAT REMEMBER. IN THIS CASE, IN WASHINGTON DC, HE'S BEING CHARGED CRIMINALLY WITH WHAT THE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR THINKS, THE SPECIAL COUNSEL THINKS, WERE HIS EFFORTS TO TRY TO REVERSE THE 2020 ELECTION EVEN THIS CASE. HIS ACTIONS ON JANUARY 6th WERE CERTAINLY AN ENORMOUS PART OF IT, AND THEY'VE SORT OF DODGED THAT ISSUE. THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CONFRONT IT HEAD ON VERY SOON. >>. I KNOW WE HAVEN'T HAD A GREAT DEAL OF TIME TO START TO SIFT THROUGH THIS. HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO GLEAN ANYTHING IN TERMS OF HOW THESE JUSTICES MAY RULE ON THAT BASED ON ANYTHING THAT'S WRITTEN HERE OR SAID HERE >>? NO, THEY TRIED TO DODGE IT SO FULLY IN THIS ONE THAT THEY DON'T DIP THEIR TOE IN THAT, BUT THEY COULD DODGE IT IN THAT WAY HERE. THEY DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO GET TO THE INSURRECTIONIST PART OF THIS, BECAUSE THEY HAD FIVE DIFFERENT OTHER WAYS TO TRY TO GET OUT OF IT. THEY CHOSE THE CONGRESSIONAL ROUTE. THERE WERE OTHER WAYS, SO THEY JUST WEREN'T CONFRONTED WITH IT AS HEAD ON. AS THEY'RE GOING TO BE IN IMMUNITY, THERE'S NO WAY FOR THEM TO DODGE IT. THEY'RE DECIDING WHETHER OR NOT HE SHOULD BE SHIELDED FROM PROSECUTION FOR HIS OWN ACTS. HIS ACTS ARE GOING TO BE AT THE HEART OF THAT CASE. >>. TO BE CLEAR, THIS DECISION TODAY FROM THE HIGH COURT- NOT JUST IMMUNITY, THE OTHER LEGAL CHALLENGES FACING THE FORMER PRESIDENT, THIS DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING FOR THOSE >>. NO, IT DOESN'T. OBVIOUSLY, THE ONE THAT'S COMING UP MOST SORT OF PRESSINGLY IS THE NEW YORK HUSH MONEY CASE. PERHAPS, THE ONLY CRIMINAL CASE THAT HE WILL FACE BEFORE THE NOVEMBER ELECTION. THAT ONE IS OF COURSE SLATED FOR MARCH 25th CRAIG. >>. LET'S TURN BACK TO THE POLITICAL FOR JUST A MOMENT HERE. AS YOU POINT OUT, WE ARE JUST HOURS AWAY FROM SUPER TUESDAY. AT THIS POINT, ANY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE FORMER PRESIDENT'S MOMENTUM WILL BE SLOWED AT ALL TOMORROW? >>. NO NUMBER ONE POLLING SHOWS NO EVIDENCE OF THAT. SKPSHS FOLKSAND AROUND THE COUNTRY ARE VOTING BY MAIL. THIS WEEKEND HE WON ELECTIONS IN MO MISSOURI, IN IDAHO, IN MICHIGAN, PICKING UP ALL THE DELEGATES. THE ONLY PLACE HE LOST THIS WEEKEND AND THE ONLY PLACE HE HAS LOST THROUGHOUT THIS PRIMARY PROCESS SO FAR WAS WASHINGTON DC, WHICH DONALD TRUMP SAID OF COURSE NIKKI HALEY, IN HIS WORDS, WOULD WIN THE SWAMP IN THE VOTE OF THE DC INSIDERS. BUT WE AND THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AS WELL THEY EXPECT HIM TO HIT THE DELL GRAT THRESHOLD TO BECOME THE THRESHOLD AS SOON AS MARCH 19th. THAT IS THE DAY WHEN DONALD TRUMP WOULD HIT THAT DELEGATE MARK TO BE THE PRESUMPTIVE NOMINEE. IT'S INTERESTING WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT MARCH 25th HUSH MONEY PAYMENT TRIAL THAT WOULD START JUST SIX DAYS LATER, SO IT'D OPEN UP HIS CALENDAR TO ALMOST. SET ASIDE THE CAMPAIGNING FOR A MOMENT AND FOCUS ON THE LEGAL ONE. OTHER NOTE, WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SUPREME COURT, IN THOSE ORAL ARGUMENTS ON APRIL 22nd, AROUND PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY, DONALD TRUMP, FOR YEARS SINCE LEAVING THE WHITE HOUSE, ATTACKED THIS US SUPREME COURT IN ONE CAUSE: FOR NOT OVERTURNING THE 2020 ELECTION RESULTS. IN 2022, HE MADE THE CASE ON HIS SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNT THAT THEY ALWAYS RULES AGAINST HIM. THAT'S WHY THIS CELEBRATION FROM HIM TODAY IS SO NOTABLE. YOU ALSO LOOK AT. HE'S BEEN TOUTING THE THREE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES, THOSE CONSERVATIVE JUSTICES. HE NOMINATED AND GOT ONTO THE BENCH. DONALD TRUMP REALIZES NOW HOW MUCH IS AT STAKE ON THE SUPREME COURT. >>. WE ALSO JUST RECEIVED AN OFFICIAL STATEMENT NOW FROM THE COLORADO STATE. THIS IS THE SECRETARY OF STATE THERE IN COLORADO, JENA GRISWOLD. THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT HAS RULED THAT STATES DO NO HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO ENFORCE SECTION 3 OF THE 14th AMENDMENT. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS DECISION, DONALD TRUMP IS AN ELIGIBLE CANDIDATE ON COLORADO'S 2024 PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY. OF COURSE THAT PRIMARY HAPPENING TOMORROW WITH MANY OTHERS AROUND THIS COUNTRY, AND, AS LAURA JARRETT POINTED OUT, THIS IS NOT JUST THE CASE FOR COLORADO. THIS ANSWERS THE QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER THE FORMER PRESIDENT CAN REMAIN ON BALLOTS IN OTHER STATES WHERE THEY HAVE TRIED TO TAKE HIM OFF THE HIGH COURT, SAYING AGAIN UNANIMOUSLY THAT STATES CANNOT DO THAT. SO A BIG THANKS TO VAUGHN. HILLYARD VAUGHN, I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO BE VERY BUSY OVER THE NEXT DAY, OR SO, COVERING THE FORMER PRESIDENT. LAURA JARRETT, NO ONE READS FASTER AND PROCESSES AND SYNTHESIZES INFORMATION QUICKER. THAN YOU. SO THANKS TO YOU AS WELL, AND THANKS TO OUR OTHER CONTRIBUTORS WHO JOINED US FOR THIS SPECIAL REPORT. OF COURSE, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MUCH, MUCH MORE ON OUR STREAMING NETWORK, NBC NEWS, NOW ONLINE AT NBC NBCNEWSCOM, AND A FULL WRAP UP ON NBC ""NIGHTLY NEWS KWTSZ"" RI.

THERE IS SOME GROUNDSWELL IN BOTH THE UNITED STATES POLITICALLY- DON'T FORGET THIS IS AN ELECTION YEAR AND AMONG OUR ALLIES, ABOUT CONTINUING TO SUPPORT WHAT IS TAKING PLACE THERE, IT IS DIFFICULT HOWEVER TO EVEN GET AID THROUGH ON THE GROUND, IT REQUIRES THE ASSISTANCE OF THE EGYPTIANS WHO CONTROL ONE SIDE OF THE BORDER. EACH OF THE VEHICLES THAT COMES INTO GAZA WITH AID, EACH ONE HAS TO BE INSPECTED. THIS IS EXTREMELY TIME CONSUMING AND LABOR-INTENSIVE. EVEN WITH THE CEASE-FIRE THAT WILL ENSURE ALL THE AID GETS IN >> THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION'S, AS IT IS ALSO WORKING ON A MARITIME TO AID GAZA BY SEA, BUT THOSE WATERS ARE ALSO CONTROLLED BY ISRAEL. YOU THINK THIS IS A POSSIBILITY, AND WOULD THAT BE MORE EFFICIENT? >> IT WOULD BE MORE EFFICIENT. >> IT WOULD BE MORE EFFICIENT, BUT THEN THE ROUTE FROM INTO GAZA HAS TO BE SECURED BY SOMEBODY. IT WON'T BE THE EGYPTIANS. IT WILL MOST LIKELY BE THE ISRAELIS TOO. EACH OF THESE PACKAGES HAS TO BE INSPECTED ALSO. IT IS A VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION.

255,dIFY6Guokj0,Morning News NOW Full Broadcast â€“ March 6,NBC News,2024-03-06 16:00:31+00:00,"WITH EARLY TODAY. I AM FRANCIS RIVERA. HAVE A GREAT WEDNESDAY. >>> BREAKING RIGHT NOW ON MORNING NEWS NOW DROPPING OUT. NBC NEWS HAS LEARNED NIKKI HALEY IS ENDING HER PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN TODAY AFTER A DISAPPOINTING SUPER TUESDAY. THE STATE IS SET FOR A 2024 REMATCH BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP AND JOE BIDEN SCOTT. IT HAS BEEN AN AMAZING DAY AND INCREDIBLE PERIOD OF TIME. >>. WE HAVE TEAM COVERAGE WHEN THE LATEST SUPER TUESDAY RETURNS ON WHAT HAPPENS NEXT. >>> STILL NO DEAL TO END THE FIGHTING IN GAZA WITH RAMADAN JUST DAYS AWAY. WE WILL BRING THAT THE LATEST OF THE NEGOTIATIONS AS THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS GROWS. >>>. THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION IS CRACKING DOWN ON CREDIT CARD FEES- WHAT IT MEANS FOR YOUR WALLET. >>> BAD FOUNDATION IF YOU WEAR MAKEUP WHILE WORKING OUT WHAT A NEW STUDY FOUND ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF SWEATING WITH PRODUCTS ON YOUR SKIN. >>> LET'S GET RIGHT TO THIS BREAKING NEWS. IN THE RACE FOR THE WHITE HOUSE FORMER UN AMBASSADOR WILL END HER CAMPAIGN. ACCORDING TO KEY SOURCES. >> THE NEWS COMES AFTER MILLIONS OF PEOPLE CAST VOTES ON SUPER TUESDAY, WITH A DOMINATING NIGHT FOR DONALD TRUMP. NIKKI HALEY LOST EVERY STATE EXCEPT VERMONT, WHICH WAS ONLY HER SECOND WIN IN 2024.. SHE ALSO CAME OUT ON TOP IN THE DC PRIMARY THIS LAST WEEKEND- DC PRIMARY THIS LAST WEEKEND, SHE HAS SET TO MAKE REMARKS. >>> DONALD TRUMP THINKING, LOOKING FORWARD TO THE GENERAL ELECTION. >>. THEY TELL ME THAT THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ONE LIKE THIS, NEVER BEEN ANYTHING SO CONCLUSIVE. NOVEMBER 5th IS GOING TO BE DOWN AS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT DAY IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. >>>. ADAM SCHIFF AND REPUBLICAN STEVE GARVEY WILL ADVANCE TO THE GENERAL ELECTION. IN THE CALIFORNIA SENATE RACE, UNDER CALIFORNIA ROLLS, THE TOP TWO VOTE GETTERS ADVANCED TO THE VOTE GETTERS ADVANCED TO THE GENERAL ELECTION. WE HAVE TEAM COVERAGE AHEAD THIS MORNING, RECAPPING SUPER TUESDAY WITH SENIOR POLITICAL MARK MURRAY. LET'S START ON DANIEL ISLAND IN SOUTH CAROLINA. LET'S GET TO THAT BREAKING NEWS ABOUT NIKKI HALEY'S CAMPAIGN. WHAT CAN YOU TELL US? >>. Reporter. GOOD MORNING, BEFORE THE SUN WAS UP IN SOUTH CAROLINA, WE WERE ABLE TO CONFIRM THE NEWS THAT NIKKI HALEY, LATER THIS MORNING, WILL BE ENDING HER BID FOR PRESIDEN. THIS IS AFTER SUPER TUESDAY, WHICH WAS A DIFFICULT NIGHT FOR THE HALEY CAMPAIGN, AND YOU ALSO HAVE TO IMAGINE THAT TRUMP WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE HAD A CLEAN SWEEP OF THESE SUPER TUESDAY STATES. AND THERE IS HALEY NOTCHING THAT WHEN BACK IN VERMONT. THAT MAKES HALEY THE FIRST WOMAN TO WIN TWO REPUBLICAN PRIMARY CONTEST. INITIALLY, SHE MADE HISTORY BY WINNING THE FIRST ONE IN DC OVER THE WEEKEND EVEN AS SHE LEAVES THE RACE, LEAVING A LEGACY FOR WOMEN TO COME BEHIND HER BUT FOR HALEY THIS MORNING I AM TOLD SHE IS NOT LIKELY TO ENDORSE IN THE SPEECH WE >> HER TO GIVE. AROUND 10:00 IN THE BUILDING BEHIND ME INSTEAD, ONE PERSON PUT IT TO US TO INVITE THE VOTERS AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE AN UPHILL CLIMB FOR THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE SOME OF THOSE FOLKS SAID THEY WOULD NEVER BE IN THE MARKET FOR TRUMP. >>. WHAT CAN WE >> TO SEE FROM HIM IN THE COMING DAYS? >>. Reporter. CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT THIS IS A PERSON WHO IS NOW SITTING THERE WITH THE NOMINATION WELL IN HAND? HE NO LONGER HAS ANY RIFLE. IT HAS BEEN CLEAR THAT. THAT HAS CHAGRINED HIM OVER THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS. HE COULD NOT WAIT TO PIVOT INTO THE GENERAL ELECTION POSTURE, LEADING TO SOME OF THE NAME- CALLING THAT HAS BECOME SO CHARACTERISTIC OF HIM FOCUSING ON HIS ONLY RIVAL, NIKKI HALEY. NIKKI WAS VERY CRITICAL OF THE FORMER PRESIDENT IN THESE WAITINWEEKS, ATTACKING HIM ON EVERYTHING, FROM HIS MORAL FIBER ON THE WORLD STAGE TO HIS MENTAL FITNESS. THOSE ARE ATTACKS AS SHE LEAVES THE RACE. THOSE ARE NOT GOING ANYWHERE BECAUSE SHE PROVIDED A REAL ECHO CHAMBER FOR THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN. TO AMPLIFY THE ATTACKS, THE CALL COMING FROM INSIDE THE GOP HOUSE CRITICIZING THE FORMER PRESIDENT, MADE IT LESS PARTY, NONAFFILIATED, AND MUCH MORE WHERE THEY CAN TAKE IT TO THE GENERAL ELECTION AND SAY: NOT JUST DEMOCRATS ARE SAYING THAT STUFF, BUT THE PEOPLE WHO RAN AGAINST HIM AND SERVED IN HIS ADMINISTRATION. AT ONE POINT >> YOU MENTIONED THAT WE DON'T. >>. HALEY, TO HAVE AN ENDORSEMENT, WALK US THROUGH THE TIMELINE TO THAT DEBATE STAGE, WHERE EVERYONE PUT THEIR HANDS UP TO WHERE SHE MIGHT BE NOW AND WHAT MIGHT BE GOING ON IN HER HEAD AS SHE TRIES TO FIGURE OUT HER NEXT STEP >>. Reporter. HERE IS THE PROBLEM WITH THE GOP LOYALTY PLEDGE, WHICH IS JUST A PIECE OF PAPER. IT IS NOT BINDING. THERE IS NOTHING THE RNC CAN DO TO ENFORCE IT. AS HALEY POINTED OUT OVER THE WEEKEND, SHE HAD TO SIGN THAT PAGE TO GET ON THE DEBATE STAGE. I WILL ALSO NOTE THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP NEVER SIGNED A PAGE LIKE THAT. TRUMP IN 2016,, DURING THE PRIMARY, WHEN I WAS COVERING IT, WAS SAYING THAT HE MIGHT NOT SUPPORT THE NOMINEE IF IT WAS ANYONE OTHER THAN HIM SOUND FAMILIAR. HE NOW HAS THE PARTIES FORCING THEMSELVES TO ASK OTHER CANDIDATES IF THEY WOULD ENDORSE THE PERSON WHO WOULD WIN, KNOWING FULL WELL. THE ONLY REASON THEY ARE ASKING IS BECAUSE OF THE GUY THAT IS ULTIMATELY GOING TO WIN THE NOMINATION. SOME REAL CIRCULAR LOGIC AT THE RNC. BUT HALEY NOW SAYING: I AM GOOD, SINCE THE PAPER IS NOT BINDING AND THE DEBATE IS OVER, I AM GOING TO DO WHAT I WANT TO DO AND WHAT SHE DOESN'T WANT TO DO IS ENDORSE TRUMP. >>. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US THIS MORNING. >>>. MARK MURRAY, WHAT ARE YOUR BIG TAKEAWAYS FROM LAST NIGHT? >>. Reporter. IT WAS A DOMINANT PERFORMANCE BY DONALD TRUMP ON SUPER TUESDAY. TRUMP ENDED UP WINNING 14 OUT OF THE 15 STATES IN THE CONTEST LAST NIGHT AND HIS ONLY LOSS WAS IN THE VERMONT PRIMARY. HE ENDED UP WINNING 94% OF THE DELEGATES THAT HAVE BEEN AWARDED SO FAR ON SUPER TUESDAY. AND AS YOU END UP SEEING NIKKI HALEY'S EXIT FROM THIS CONTEST THIS MORNING, THAT IS ABOUT A 1000 DELEGATE LEAD OVER NIKKI HALEY. NIKKI HALEY ENDED UP TELLING CHRISTIAN WALKER ON MEET THE PRESS THAT SHE WOULD CONTINUE TO STAY IN THE CONTEST AS LONG AS IT REMAINED COMPETITIVE. I THINK WE GOT OUR ANSWER LAST NIGHT. >>. AT THIS POINT, WE KNOW NIKKI HALEY, GOT 20, 30 WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. THESE ARE DEMOCRATS INTERESTED IN HER INDEPENDENCE AND STRESSED IT IN HER. WHO DO YOU THINK IT'S HER VOTE AS WE MOVE TO THE GENERAL ELECTION? >>. Reporter. IT IS GOING TO BE ABOUT HALF, AND DONALD TRUMP ENDED UP HAVING A DOMINANT PERFORMANCE AMONG SELF DESCRIBED REPUBLICANS. NIKKI HALEY DID VERY WELL, AS WE HAVE SEEN IN PREVIOUS CONTEST WITH MODERATES AND LIBERALS- AS WELL AS POLITICAL INDEPENDENCE BUT THERE IS A CLUE IN THE EXIT POLL THAT WE ENDED UP GETTING LAST NIGHT ABOUT WHO THESE NIKKI HALEY VOTERS ARE. IN VIRGINIA, FOR EXAMPLE, WE ENDED UP FINDING 51% OF NIKKI HALEY'S VOTERS APPROVE OF PRESIDENT BIDEN'S JOB PERFORMANCE, VERSUS 47% WHO SAY THEY DISAPPROVE. THAT 50-50 SPLIT IS A GOOD INDICATION ON THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO VOTE FOR JOE BIDEN- WHO MIGHT ALREADY BE JOE BIDEN VOTERS BEFORE THIS PRIMARY SEASON BEGAN- VERSUS THOSE REPUBLICANS- AGAIN ABOUT HALF- WHO ARE REPUBLICANS AND DONALD TRUMP NEEDS TO WIN BACK. >> FORMER. PRESIDENT TRUMP TALK TO HIS STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES. >>. Reporter. SAVANNA. AGAIN, THE PATTERN THAT WE ENDED UP SEEING LAST NIGHT WAS THAT HE DID SO WELL AMONG CONSERVATIVES AND REPUBLICANS. PRIMARY VOTER, AND THOSE ARE THE BEDROCK. THOSE ARE THE LETTERS YOU WANT. THOSE ARE THE LETTERS YOU WANT TO DO WELL WITH. IN A REPUBLICAN PRIMARY, THEY MAKE UP THE BULK OF THE VOTERS AND AS HE ENDED UP DOING IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND IOWA AND SOUTH CAROLINA, HE IS DOING VERY WELL LAST NIGHT IN NORTH VIRGINIA AND --. VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA WHERE HE DID NOT DO THAT WELL IS AMONG MODERATES AND INDEPENDENT. THAT HAS BEEN NIKKI HALEY'S LANE IN THIS RACE. SHE DID VERY WELL AND THAT IS AN INDICATION OF THE WORK HE HAS TO DO AT LEAST WITH HE REPUBLICANS WHO ARE OPEN TO VOTING FOR HIM COME NOVEMBER >>. WE PIVOT TO THE GENERAL ELECTION. LET'S FOCUS ON PRESIDENT BIDEN. IS THERE ANY CLUE ON HOW HE MIGHT DO IN NOVEMBER? HE DID NOT HAVE A STRONG CHALLENGER LIKE NIKKI HALEY BUT THERE WERE SOME OTHER PEOPLE ON THE BALLOT. WHAT DID WE LEARN? >>? Reporter. I THINK HE IS CRUISING HIS PARTY'S NOMINATION AND HE HAS VERY LITTLE COMPETITION. THERE WERE SOME STATES WHERE HE ENDED UP GETTING ALMOST ALL OF THE VOTES. THERE WAS A CONTEST IN MINNESOTA WHERE HE ENDED UP GETTING 70% AND YOU END UP HAVING UNCOMMITTED HIM GETTING A SIZABLE SHARE OF THAT VOTE. AND IN THE CONTEST, LIKE AMERICAN SAMOA, HE ENDED UP LOSING TO A NOAME, TO THE PERSON WHO WE HAVE NEVER EVEN HEARD OF CALLED JASON PALMER LAST NIGHT. INSTANCES OF MINORITY VOTERS. JOE BIDEN HAS CRUISED HIS PARTY'S NOMINATION. THE PARTY HAS DECIDED HE IS GOING TO BE THERE NOMINEE. WE WILL HAVE A GENERAL ELECTION OVER THE NEXT EIGHT MONTHS. >>. MARK MURRAY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >>>. THIS MORNING THERE IS A MAJOR SHAKEUP THAT COULD DETERMINE CONTROL OF THE SENATE. KYRSTEN SINEMA, AN INDEPENDENT ANNOUNCED SHE IS NOT RUNNING FOR REELECTION. >>. IN A BLISTERING VIDEO SHE POSTED ON ASK TOUTING HER ACCOMPLISHMENTS. WELL, SHE WAS IN OFFICE BEFORE BLAMING HER DECISION NOT TO RUN AGAIN ON THE CURRENT TOXIC POLITICAL, THE CURRENT TOXIC POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT >>. IT IS ALL OR NOTHING. >>. JULIE JOHNSTON IS NOW. HOW MUCH OF A SURPRISE IS IT THAT KRISTEN CINEMA IS NOT GOING TO RUN AGAIN AND WHERE DOES THIS LEAVE THE ARIZONA SENATE RACE >>. Reporter. IT WAS SOMEWHAT OF A SURPRISE TO THOSE ON CAPITOL HILL AND EVEN HER COLLEAGUES BUT THE FACT THAT SHE DECIDED NOT TO RUN IS NOT REALLY A SURPRISE TO THOSE OF US WHO HAVE COVERED HER AND WATCHED HER CLOSELY. I WAS TOLD BY SOME SOURCES THAT THE BIPARTISAN BILL WAS REALLY THE LINCHPIN TO DECIDE WHETHER SHE IS GOING TO CONTINUE FORWARD AND HAVE SOMETHING TO FORWARD AND HAVE SOMETHING TO RUN ON IN THE STATE, IN DEMOCRATS, OR WHETHER SHE IS GOING TO BOW OUT, BECAUSE SHE HAS SEEN THE WRITING ON THE WALL AND CERTAINLY THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED. IN THIS SITUATION, THE RACE IS EFFECTIVELY BETWEEN REPUBLICAN CARRIE LAKE, WHO WAS ON CAPITOL HILL YESTERDAY AND TOLD ME SHE HAS OTHER ENDORSEMENTS COMING- AND THE DEMOCRAT, WHO IS A MEMBER OF THE HOUSE AND HAS KNOWN HER FOR SOME TIME. I DID TALK TO LAKE YESTERDAY AT THE CAPITOL AND HERE IS WHAT SHE HAD TO SAY: >> WE DISAGREE ON PROBABLY EVERY POLICY. I APPRECIATE A COUPLE OF VERY STRONG POINTS. >>. CARRIE LAKE HAS HAD SOME VERY DISCOURAGING COMMENTS ON KRISTEN, CINEMA AND OTHERS BUT SHE DID SAY ONE OF THE THINGS SHE FEARS IS THE FILIBUSTER GOING AWAY. NOW THAT SHE IS OUT AND THAT IS SOMETHING. THAT THE SENATOR HAS ALSO VOTED TO PROTECT THE FILIBUSTER. CERTAINLY THIS WILL CHANGE. WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN THAT VERY COMPETITIVE RACE. >>. THAT WAS A WAY RACE DOWN TO TWO PEOPLE. HOW IS IT GOING? >>. JOHN, HE SAID HE HAS DECIDED TO RUN FOR THE NUMBER TWO POSITION, THE ONE WHO COUNTS THE VOTES AND ALSO VERY IMPORTANT. SO THAT LEAVES THIS. AND TOOK AWAY RACE BETWEEN JOHN CORNYN AND JOHN KUHN. HOWEVER, WE ARE LIKE NINE MONTHS AWAY FROM THIS DECISION EVEN HAPPENING. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT OTHERS COULD JUMP IN THE RACE. RICK SCOTT HAD JUMPED IN AND WHO IS CURRENTLY THE GUY IN CHARGE OF SENATE REPUBLICANS INTO CONGRESS. SO THERE'S A LOT THAT CAN HAPPEN. BUT RIGHT NOW IT IS BETWEEN THOSE TWO GUYS AND THEY ARE TRYING TO VOTE LOCKUP SUPPORT >>. JOHN VERSUS, JOHN VERSUS JOHN, YOU POINT OUT THAT THIS WILL NOT HAPPEN UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTION. SO HOW MUCH COULD THE ELECTION AND THE RESULTS, WHETHER TRUMP WINDSOR LOSES AND WHETHER THE REPUBLICANS TAKE CONTROL OF THE SENATE OR NOT, HOW MUCH DID JAZZ --. DOES THAT INFLUENCE? >>. IT DOES INFLUENCE. JOHN CORNYN AND JOHN KUHN. THEY HAD A TOUGH RELATIONSHIP BUT HE REALLY SEES THE WRITING ON THE WALL THAT THIS GUY IS GOING TO BECOME THE PARTY'S NOMINEE AND IF HE BECOMES PRESIDENT, THE MINORITY LEADER CERTAINLY HAS TO WORK WITH HIM. SO THAT WHEN HAVE SOME AFFECTS ALSO INTERESTING. I ASKED CARRIE LAKE THIS QUESTION YESTERDAY. SHE IS NO FAN OF McCONNELL. SHE SAYS SHE HAS NO PREDICTION YET. BUT SHE DID SAY THOSE VYING TO BE LEADER WILL COME OUT IN THE COMING DAYS. AND THAT COULD BE TELLING, BECAUSE SHE IS IN ALIGNMENT WITH TRUMP. AGAIN, TRUMP CAN ALWAYS PUT HIS THUMB ON THE SCALE, AS HE IS KNOWN TO DO, AND DECIDE THE LEADERS THAT WAY BUT WE HAVE A LOT OF TIME >>>. TURNING NOW TO THE WAR IN GAZA. AND HAMAS SAYS IT IS PUSHING AHEAD WITH CEASE-FIRE TALKS IN CAIRO. >>. WHILE THE MILITANT GROUP HAS BEEN LOCKED IN, ISRAEL DID NOT SEND A DELEGATION UNDER THIS SIX WEEK CEASE-FIRE DEAL BEING DISCUSSED. THERE WOULD BE A RELEASE OF HOSTAGES AND PALESTINIAN PRISONERS AND AN INCREASE IN AID TO GAZA'S STARVING POPULATION >>. WE KNOW THERE IS AN URGENCY TO GET THE DEAL DONE BEFORE THE START OF RAMADAN. SPECIFICALLY, WHERE DO THINGS STAND THIS MORNING AND WHAT IS THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION SAYING >>? Reporter. WE ARE CERTAINLY HEARING THE URGENCY FROM THE WHITE HOUSE, FROM THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION. OFFICIALS TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT BIDEN HAD TO SAY. >>. WE ARE IN THE HANDS OF HAMAS RIGHT NOW. THE ISRAELIS HAVE BEEN COOPERATING. WE WILL KNOW IN A COUPLE OF DAYS WE NEED TO CEASE-FIRE. THERE HAS GOT TO BE A CEASE-. THERE HAS GOT TO BE A CEASE- FIRE BECAUSE RAMADAN. IF THIS CONTINUES INTO RAMADAN, IT COULD BE VERY, VERY DANGEROUS STOCK. RAMADAN STARTS ON MARCH 10th. JUST A COUPLE OF DAYS AWAY. THE DELEGATION IN CAIRO SAYS NO AGREEMENT HAD BEEN MET YESTERDAY AND, POINTING A FINGER THIS MORNING, THEY DID NOT BOTHER TO SEND A DELEGATION TO CAIRO. WE ARE NOT HEARING THE SAME KIND OF URGENCY ABOUT HOSTAGE RELEASE NEGOTIATIONS >>. THE URGENCY OUTSIDE OF THAT SEEMS TO BE COMING FROM THE LEVEL OF STARVATION IN GAZA, WHICH IS WHY SO MANY PEOPLE WANT TO SEE A CEASE-FIRE, A CONVOY TURNED AWAY BY ISRAELI FORCES, AND ALSO A DAMNING NEW REPORT BY EXPERTS ACCUSING ISRAEL OF INTENTIONALLY STARVING PEOPLE IN GAZA, TARGETING A CONVOY'S. WHAT MORE CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THAT AND HOW ISRAEL IS RESPONDING? >>. Reporter. LANGUAGE ABOUT THOSE EXPERTS WHICH I WILL GET TO REMEMBER. THE WORLD FOOD PROGRAM PAUSED THE CONVOYS TO THE NORTH OF GAZA, WHERE ORGANIZATIONS, THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF MALNUTRITION AND SEVERE STARVATION ARE HAPPENING NOW. THEY PAUSED THOSE CONVOYS BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT GET THOSE TRUCKS SAFELY IN. A 14-TRUCK CONVOY WAS TURNED BACK BY THE MILITARY AT THE ONE BECAUSE IT CHECKPOINT. BECAUSE IT CHECKPOINT -- GAZA CHECKPOINT. THE ONLY WAY IS AIRDROPS AND OTHER OPTIONS BY C. THOSE ARE LAST RESORT. AND FROM THAT PANEL I WANT TO READ ONE LINE TO YOU FROM THESE UN EXPERTS. THEY SAY: ISRAEL IS INTENTIONALLY STARVING THAT GAZAN PEOPLE AND IT IS TARGETING CIVILIANS SEEKING AID. ISRAEL MUST END ITS CAMPAIGN OF STARVATION AND TARGETING CIVILIANS- AND THAT IS A DIRECT QUOTE- REALLY QUESTIONING ISRAEL'S COMMITMENT. >>. ISRAEL'S WAR CABINET MINISTER IS IN THE UNITED STATES MEETING WITH OFFICIALS OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS. WHAT CAME OUT OF THOSE TALKS? >>? Reporter. HE HAS BEEN IN THE UNITED STATES, THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN SPEAKING WITH THE SAME MESSAGE FROM THE SECRETARY OF STATE, BLINKEN FROM THE PRESIDENT: GET MORE AID. WHY IS ISRAEL PUTTING UP OBSTACLES AND ALL SIGNS OF THE WHITE HOUSE UPPING PRESSURE ON THE GOVERNMENT? EVEN THOUGH GIFT IS A MEMBER OF THE WAR CABINET AND HE IS AN INFLUENTIAL VOICE. HE IS NOT THE FINAL VOICE. HE IS HERE IN LONDON AND EXPECTED TO HAVE A MEETING WITH DAVID CAMERON. THE UK, SIMILARLY, HAS RUN OUT OF PATIENCE AND WE HEARD HIM YESTERDAY. HE IS VERY STRONG LANGUAGE PREVIEWING HIS MEETING OF TODAY, BUT THE FACT THAT HE IS IN THE UNITED STATES ARE NOW IN THE UK WAS NOT THROUGH THE BENJAMIN NETANYAHU GOVERNMENT, BENJAMIN NETANYAHU GOVERNMENT, OR THROUGH THE FOREIGN MINISTE. THAT REALLY SUGGESTS AND POINTS TO THE FACT THAT THE UK AND THE UNITED STATES ARE GETTING EXASPERATED. >>>. THE SOGGY WEATHER IS HERE TO STAY ON THE EAST COAST, BUT FLOOD WATCH IS FOR 30 MILLION PEOPLE STRETCHING FROM NEW PEOPLE, STRETCHING FROM NEW JERSEY TO MASSACHUSETTS. >>. UMBRELLAS ARE NEEDED AND WE HAVE ALREADY HAD A LINE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WORKING THROUGH SOUTH FLORIDA. THAT IS MOVING OUT, BUT WE HAVE LEFT OVER LINGERING RAIN ACROSS PARTS OF THE SOUTHEAST IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS, PLACES LIKE ATLANTA ALREADY PICKING UP A COUPLE OF INCHES OF RAIN AS WE LOOK FROM THE MID- ATLANTIC TO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY. WE HAVE ALREADY BEEN SOGGY FOR THE BETTER PART OF THE MORNING HOURS AND YOU CAN SEE IT HAS BEEN PRETTY QUIET ACROSS THE NORTHEAST SO FAR. THIS MOISTURE WILL START TO LIFT AND WE WILL BE DEALING WITH SOME BUSY CONDITIONS, ESPECIALLY ALONG THE I-95 CORRIDOR AS WE GET INTO THE REALLY IMPORTANT COMMUTE TIME. 30 MILLION PEOPLE, INCLUDING THOSE IN NEW YORK, BOSTON, ALL INCLUDED, WITH THE MAJOR CITIES, BEING IMPACTED BY THE POTENTIAL OF FLASH, FLOODING AND PLENTY OF MOISTURE WILL LIFT INTO THE AREA. WE HAVE A CHANCE FOR SOME IMPRESSIVE RAINFALL RATES: ONE OR TWO INCHES PER HOUR, A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, PROLONGED RAIN, NOT HARD FOR US TO SEE, THAT FLOODING, ESPECIALLY IN THE VULNERABLE AREAS. THIS EVENING YOU CAN SEE THIS RAIN WILL BE AROUND EVEN WELL. PAST THE AFTERNOON, COMMUTE WELL INTO THE EVENING. WE WILL STILL BE DEALING WITH THE RAINFALL FOR PORTIONS OF VIRGINIA. THAT IS SOMETHING WE HAVE TO WATCH FOR, AND THE MODERATE TO HEAVY RAIN WILL BE FROM VIRGINIA TO MAINE. THIS RAIN WILL STICK AROUND FOR THE FIRST HALF OF THE DAY FOR SOME LOCATIONS AND EVENTUALLY MOVE OUT. THAT SYSTEM MOVES OFFSHORE AND IT WILL BE LOOKING BETTER, BUT NOT. BEFORE WE DEAL WITH THAT EARLY RAIN FOR THE FIRST HALF OF THE DAY WE WILL SEE SOME DRIER CONDITIONS AND WE WILL GET THE MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS. RAINFALL TOTALS FROM ONE TO TWO INCHES UP TO THREE INCHES ACROSS THE NORTHEAST, THE FLASH FLOODING IS GOING TO BE SOMETHING WE CONTINUE TO HAVE AS A POTENTIAL, NOT JUST TODAY BUT INTO TOMORROW TOO >> GOT IT. >>>. MUCH MORE TO COME LATER THIS HOUR OVERDUE. WE WILL TELL YOU ABOUT A NEW CAP ON CREDIT CARD LATE FEES. THAT COULD SAVE CUSTOMERS MILLIONS OF DOLLARS >>> MORE LEGAL TROUBLE FOR THE DISGRACED SENATOR BOB MENDEZ. >> THAT WASN'T ME. >>. YOU GOTTA SEE THIS >>. STAY TUNED. NOW, WEEK NIGHTS AT 8:00 EASTERN 5:00, PACIFIC ON NBC NEWS NOW >>>. BOB MENENDEZ IS FACING NEW CHARGES THIS MORNING, ALLEGING THAT HE AND HIS WIFE HAVE OBSTRUCTED JUSTICE IN A BRIBERY CASE. HE NOW FACES A TOTAL OF EIGHT FEDERAL CHARGES >>. PROSECUTORS HAVE ALLEGED THAT HE AND HIS WIFE MAY HAVE USED POLITICAL INFLUENCE TO POCKET HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN BRIBES, INCLUDING CASH, GOLD BARS, USE TOWARD A HOME, MORTGAGE AND LUXURY VEHICLE. MENENDEZ SAYING YESTERDAY: I AM INNOCENT AND I WILL PROVE IT. NO MATTER HOW MANY CHARGES, THEY CONTINUE TO PILE ON BOTH. HE AND HIS WIFE HAVE PLED NOT GUILTY. >>> WHAT MORE CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THE NEW CHARGES? >>. Reporter. GOOD MORNING. PROSECUTORS ARE ACCUSING MENENDEZ AND HIS CODEFENDANT OF TRYING TO COVER UP A BRIBE BY MAKING IT LOOK LIKE A LOAN, AND THEY SAY THAT THEY LIED TO THEIR OWN LAWYERS AS PART OF THIS. THIS WAS DURING THE INVESTIGATION AND THAT THOSE LAWYERS INADVERTENTLY CONVEYED FALSE INFORMATION TO PROSECUTORS. >>. THE NEW INDICTMENT COMES DAYS AFTER ONE OF MENENDEZ'S CODEFENDANTS, A NEW JERSEY BUSINESSMAN. HE PLED GUILTY AND AGREED TO COOPERATE WITH THE PROBE. HOW MUCH OF A BURDEN IS THAT GOING TO BE TO THE CASE? >>. Reporter. THAT APPEARS TO BE THE SOURCE OF THESE NEW ALLEGATIONS. THIS NEW JERSEY BUSINESSMAN WAS ACCUSED IN THE INDICTMENT OF PROVIDING A MERCEDES FOR NADINE MENENDEZ AND MAKING PAYMENTS ON THAT CAR IN EXCHANGE FOR OFFICIAL ACTS BY THE SENATOR. TWO DAYS AGO HE AGREED TO COOPERATE AND PLEAD GUILTY, AND HE IS TELLING PROSECUTORS THAT AFTER A SUBPOENA WENT OUT ABOUT THE MERCEDES, MENENDEZ WENT TO HIM AND THEY CONCOCTED A FALSE STORY ABOUT THE PAYMENTS. AND THAT IS THE COVER-UP THE PROSECUTORS ARE ALLEGING: >> THIS IS NOT THE FIRST SUPERSEDING INDICTMENT. THE TRIAL DATE IS SET FOR MAY 6th. COULD THIS INDICTMENT HAVE ANY IMPACT ON THE TIMELINE? AND HOW LIKELY THAT WE COULD SEE EVEN MORE CHARGES >>. Reporter. PROSECUTORS ARE TELLING THE JUDGE. IT SHOULD NOT, BUT THAT IS THEIR VIEW. EXPANDING THE CHARGES BY 14 IS DEEPLY SIGNIFICANT. SOME OF THOSE LAWYERS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REPRESENT THE DEFENDANTS ANYMORE, BECAUSE THEY MAY END UP BEING WITNESSES >>>. IN GEORGIA, ASHLEY MERCHANT IS EXPECTED TO APPEAR BEFORE THE COMMITTEE INVESTIGATING FULTON COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY. ATTORNEY >>. SHE HAS BEEN LEADING THE CHARGE TO TRY TO REMOVE WILLIS FROM THE ELECTION INTERFERENCE CASE AGAINST TRUMP AND MANY OTHERS AND SAYS WILLIS FAILED TO DISCLOSE A ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP WITH NATHAN WADE, THE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR. BOTH HAVE DENIED ANY WRONGDOING >>. JOINING US IS LEGAL ANALYST DANNY CEBALLOS, THE FIRST PERSON SAID TO TESTIFY IN WEIGHTS RELATIONSHIP. WHAT DO YOU? >> THE FOCUS TO BE TODAY >>. Reporter. WE ALREADY KNOW IT IS GOING TO BE ABOUT WHAT DOES MERCHANT KNOW AND WHAT IS THE BASIS OF HER KNOWLEDGE AND WHAT IS THE BASIS OF HER BELIEF THAT ONE OF THE WITNESSES, TERRENCE BRADLEY, KNOWS A LOT MORE THAN HE TESTIFIED TO UNDERSTAND. MERCHANT MAY HAVE SOME OBJECTIONS BASED ON CONFIDENTIALITY, POSSIBLY WORK PRODUCT BUT IN ALL LIKELIHOOD SHE IS IN LINE WITH THE COMMITTEE AND TO SOME DEGREE, TO THE EXTENT THAT SHE BROUGHT OUT HER OWN WORK PRODUCTS DURING THE PROSECUTION. SHE MAY WAIVE THAT BUT SHE IS -- MAY NOT BE LOOKING TO EXPOSE THIS INFORMATION, BECAUSE SHE HAS AN INTEREST IN GETTING IT OUT THERE IN A PLACE WHERE THE RULES OF EVIDENCE DON'T CONSTRAIN HER THE WAY THEY DID IN COURT >> THIS ELECTION INTERFERENCE CASE WITH MANY CODEFENDANTS, AND ARE THERE ANY POTENTIAL ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGES AND A CONFIDENCE SHE MIGHT HAVE WHERE SHE CANNOT ANSWER QUESTIONS? >>? IN THEORY, YES, BECAUSE SHE BROUGHT ALL OF THIS OUT. IT WOULD BE HARD TO ARGUE THAT AS AN ATTORNEY YOU DON'T GET ACCESS TO MY INVESTIGATION. YOU GO INTO YOUR OWN INVESTIGATION BUT SOMETIMES YOU CAN WAIVE THAT. A GOOD EXAMPLE WOULD BE IF YOU INTRODUCE YOUR LEGISLATION INTO THE RECORD. THIS IS AN INTERESTING TOPIC, BECAUSE IT IS GENERALLY A GOOD IDEA TO HIRE AN INVESTIGATOR TO DO THIS KIND OF WORK. BECAUSE YOU AVOID THAT AWKWARD SITUATION WHERE YOU AND YOUR ATTORNEY ARE SAYING: REMEMBER WHEN I SHOWED YOU THIS. YOU WANT TO AVOID A SITUATION WHERE THE ATTORNEY IS TESTIFYING BUT STILL NOTHING WRONG WITH WHAT MERCHANT DID. SHE HAS AN INTEREST IN GETTING THIS INFORMATION OUT. >>. HOW LONG CAN THEY TAKE IN THIS INVESTIGATION? >>. GEORGIA'S LEGISLATURE IS A LOT LIKE CONGRESS. THEY HOLD INVESTIGATIVE HEARINGS BUT THERE REALLY ISN'T ANY CRIMINAL OR CIVIL CONSEQUENCES. THERE ARE IF YOU REFUSE TO SHOW UP AND YOU ARE SUBPOENAED BUT IT IS MOSTLY A FACT-FINDING MISSION, ANYTHING UPON WHICH LEGISLATION MAY BE HAD. SO THESE HEARINGS ARE NOT AT ALL CRIMINAL IN NATURE. THEY ARE NOT CONSEQUENCES FOR THE FULTON COUNTY CASE ITSELF- NO SUBSTANCE OF CONSEQUENCES BUT OBVIOUSLY THEY WOULD HAVE MAJOR REPUTATIONAL CONSEQUENCES IF MORE INFORMATION COMES OUT THAT WE COULD NOT HERE BECAUSE OF THE RULES OF EVIDENCE >>. THIS COMMITTEE SAYS IT WILL INVESTIGATE FOR AS LONG AS IT TAKES OUR INDICATIONS ARE THAT IT COULD TAKE A WHILE. IS IT POSSIBLE THIS COULD IMPACT THE ELECTION INTERFERENCE AGAINST TRUMP >>. IF INFORMATION COMES OUT IN THE HEARING, THAT COMES BACK TO THIS DISQUALIFICATION HEARING AND McAFEE. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS OR IF IT WILL BE REOPENED BY GEORGE McAFEE. IT MIGHT NOT HAVE THAT MUCH OF AN EFFECT. YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT THIS DISQUALIFICATION IN FANI WILLIS'S AND THE STATE HAS MADE THAT ARGUMENT, AND THEY ARE RIGHT. WHAT REALLY HAPPENS IS IF FANI WILLIS IS DISQUALIFIED, THEN YOU HAVE A PROBLEM OF WHO IS GOING TO TAKE UP THE PROSECUTION FOR HER. BUT NOTHING IS EFFECTIVE OF THE SUBSTANCE OF GUILT OF THE DEFENDANTS, GUILT OR INNOCENCE >>. WE ARE STILL WAITING TO SEE IF SHE COULD BE DISQUALIFIED >>. DEPENDING ON WHETHER OR NOT, THE JUDGE REOPENS THE HEARING WHICH HE MIGHT, WE REALLY DON'T KNOW. >>>. INTERNATIONAL NEWS: HAITI'S PRIME MINISTER IS IN PUERTO RICO THIS MORNING. >>>. CLAUDIO JOINS US NOW. GOOD >>>. CLAUDIO JOINS US NOW, GOOD MORNING. >>. Reporter. ACCORDING TO MEDIA, THE PRIME MINISTER WAS FORCED TO LAND. AFTER HE WAS NOT ALLOWED TO RETURN TO HIS OWN COUNTRY FOR THE PAST FEW DAYS. THE PRIME MINISTER. UPON RETURN TO HAITI, ARMED GANGS TRIED TO TAKE OVER THE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT TO STOP HIM FROM LANDING, DEMANDING THAT THE PRIME, DEMANDING THAT THE PRIME MINISTER SEND DOWN. --. VIOLENCE IN HAITI SPIRALED OUT OF CONTROL, LEADING TO A MASSIVE JAILBREAK. LET'S GO TO INDIA, WHERE THOUSANDS OF FARMERS DEMAND MINIMUM PRICE GUARANTEES FOR MINIMUM PRICE GUARANTEES FOR THEIR CROPS. PROTESTS WERE SUSPENDED AFTER A YOUNG FARMER DIED DURING THAT PROTEST. PREVENTED FROM ENTERING THE BORDERS, THEY HAVE BEEN HEAVILY BARRICADED. THE FARMERS ALSO LOOKING FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO WAIVE THEIR DEBT. >>>. AND PARIS, WHERE THE GOVERNMENT -- INITIALLY ORGANIZERS, ALLOWING FREE ACCESS TO AS MANY AS 600,000 PEOPLE WHO WATCH THE OPENING CEREMONY ALONG THE BANKS OF THE RIVER. ALONG THE BANKS OF THE RIVER, THAMES, 300,000, MORE THAN 100,000 WILL BE PAYING TICKET HOLDERS. NONE OF THE 200,000 WILL WATCH FROM THE UPPER THANKS, BUT BY FROM THE UPPER THANKS, BUT BY INVITATION ONLY. >>> AN EXPLOSION IN A MICHIGAN BUILDING. WHAT INVESTIGATORS FOUND INSIDE? >>> TOO MUCH SCREEN TIME. WHAT INTELLIGENCE? THIS IS WHAT MY VOICE SOUNDS. THIS IS WHAT MY VOICE SOUNDS LIKE WHEN I CLONED IT. >>>. WE HAVE THE LATEST INFORMATION ON THAT MASSIVE EXPLOSION IN MICHIGAN THAT LEFT ONE PERSON DEAD. AN INVESTIGATION IS UNDERWAY TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THE FIRE: ILLEGALLY STORING FLAMMABLE MATERIALS >>. Reporter. MASSIVE EXPLOSIONS LIGHTING UP THE SKY IN MICHIGAN, CAUSING A MASSIVE FACTORY FIRE AT AN INDUSTRIAL SITE ABOUT 25 MILES OUTSIDE OF DETROIT. >> WE HAVE A LOT OF DEBRIS IN THE AIR. >>. Reporter. AUTHORITIES SAY THE PLANT DISTRIBUTES PAPER, PRODUCTS AND OTHER ITEMS IN THE CLINTON TOWNSHIP, PROJECTED INTO THE AIR AND TRAVELING AS FAR AS A MILE AWAY. AS CANISTERS BECAME PROJECTILES, RESIDENTS WERE ASKED TO AVOID THE AREA, STAY INSIDE AND CLOSE THE WINDOWS. NEIGHBORS DESCRIBED HEARING A LOUD BANG WHICH SOUNDED LIKE FIREWORKS SHAKING THE GROUND. SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS SHOWING IMAGES OF HUGE PLUMES OF FIRE AND SMOKE, BILLOWING THE TOWNSHIP RELEASING A STATEMENT SAYING QUOTE UPON ARRIVAL. OFFICERS OBSERVED MATERIAL FLYING IN ALL DIRECTIONS FROM THE BUILDING POLICE, ALSO WRITING ON FACEBOOK: PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, STAY INSIDE. >>. THEY ARE ATTENDING THE FIRE, BUT WHAT IS GOING ON WITH AIR QUALITY? >>. Reporter. WORKERS ARE WORKING TO PUT OUT THE FLAMES. INVESTIGATORS SAY THEY WERE ABLE TO COLLECT DEBRIS THAT LANDED AS FAR AS TWO MILES AWAY FROM HERE. THEY ARE QUALITY AND WATER IS SAFE. BUT THERE IS A WARNING FOR RESIDENTS: IF THEY SEE ANY OF THOSE CANISTERS, DO NOT PICK THEM UP, BECAUSE THEY COULD CONTAIN GAS WHICH COULD EXPLODE. BACK TO YOU: >>> TIME NOW FOR OUR WEEKLY MEDICAL CHECK, A CLOSER LOOK AT HOW MUCH EXERCISE YOU NEED TO LOWER YOUR RISK OF STROKE. >>> MORE SCREEN TIME COULD BE IMPACTING HUNGER COMMUNICATES. >>> OUR MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR TO BREAK DOWN THESE HEADLINES. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. WHAT MORE CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT EXERCISE REDUCING THE RISK FOR STROKE? HOW ARE THEY CONNECTED? >>. WE HAVE ALWAYS KNOWN THAT SOME PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IS BETTER THAN NO PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND NOW WE HAVE AN ANALYSIS. THIS IS CONSIDERED- THE STUDY OF STUDIES, THE STUDY OF STUDIES ABOUT 15, TO LOOK AT SOMETIMES MONITORED LEVELS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND ASSOCIATE IT WITH LEVELS OR RISK OF STROKE. SOME PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IS PROVING BETTER THAN NONE, AND IT SHOWS THAT LOWER LEVELS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE HIGH-INTENSITY AEROBICS OR RUNNING OR BIKING. IF THAT IS YOUR SPORT OF CHOICE, THAT IS GREAT. BUT WHEN YOU GET YOUR HEART RATE SYSTEM JUST A LITTLE HIGHER, WOULD LIKELY TO LEAD TO STROKE COMPARED TO DOING NOTHING AT ALL. THIS HAS FOLLOWED FOR MANY YEARS. THIS IS, I THINK, IMPORTANT FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS. THE DOCTOR'S ORDERS ARE NOT TO BE A SPECTATOR BUT TO TRY TO MAKE MOVEMENT EASIER, AND YOU DON'T NEED TO OVERTHINK IT. HERE ARE SOME TIPS THAT I HAVE PERSONALLY DONE. WHEN YOU ARE PARKING AT A GROCERY STORE, LOOK FOR THE PHASE THAT IS FARTHEST AWAY. IT MIGHT BE KIND OF PAINFUL BUT IT ADDS 1000 STEPS OR MORE, DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU PARK. TAKE A STEP EARLIER AND WALK TO WHEREVER YOU ARE TRYING TO GO. IF YOU ARE MEETING A FRIEND AND TAKE A WALK AND PUSHING AWAY- I AM GUILTY OF THIS MYSELF- PUSH THAT THING AWAY AND WALK OUTSIDE. STUDIES SHOW: IF YOU GO OUTSIDE EVEN FOR 10 SECONDS, YOU ARE MORE LIKELY TO TAKE MORE STEPS THAT DAY >>>. WE HAVE ANOTHER REASON TO PUT SCREENS DOWN, AND THIS HAS TO DO WITH OUR LITTLE ONES. THIS COULD BE IMPACTING YOUR TODDLER'S SPEECH. WHAT IS THE IMPACT AND WHAT IS THE TIME AGE? HOW LONG? >> THE GENERAL RULE OF THUMB UNDER THE AGE OF TWO. THERE IS A RECOMMENDATION FOR NO SCREEN TIME. I HAVE BEEN THERE, WE HAVE ALL BEEN THERE. WHERE YOU HAVE CHILDREN, AND ESPECIALLY DURING COVID, THEY HAVE A LOT MORE SCREEN TIME. THEY LOOKED AT 220 FAMILIES AND 12 MONTHS TO 36 MONTHS IN THAT TIME PERIOD, WHERE THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS RECOMMENDS NO SCREEN TIME OR SEVERELY LIMITED SCREEN TIME. AND HERE IS WHAT IS REALLY STARTLING. WE KNOW THAT SCREEN TIME IS THAT FOR A REASON BUT WE HAVE NOT HAD A STUDY THAT CORRELATES- AND I THINK THIS IS WHAT LISTENERS AND VIEWERS NEED TO UNDERSTAND- FOR EVERY MINUTE OF SCREEN TIME- 12 TO 36 MONTHS OLD- THAT AFFECTS THEM AS THEY GET OLDER AND THEY ACTUALLY LOST SOME OF THEIR SPEECH AND HAD FEWER ADULT WORDS THEY WERE USING. THEY SPOKE FEWER VOCALIZATIONS, BEING ABLE TO SAY A FULL SENTENCE AS YOU, AND SCREEN TIME THEY HAVE LESS ABILITY TO DO THAT AND I THINK WHAT IS REALLY TROUBLING. THEY ENGAGE IN FEWER CONVERSATIONS. DOCTORS HAVE A PLAN TO KNOW. DOCTORS HAVE A PLAN TO KNOW YOUR THREE M'S, KNOW YOUR SCREEN TIME, MODELED YOUR SCREEN TIME AND MANAGE A MEANINGFUL INTERACTION, MEANING TALK ABOUT ANYTIME YOU USE THE SCREEN WHAT THEY ARE LISTENING TO. I AM GUILTY OF IT TOO CONSTANTLY. NO JUDGMENT, BUT IT DOES MATTER >>>. A NEW STUDY FROM THE JOURNAL SAYS: WEARING MAKEUP WHILE EXERCISING CAN HAVE SOME NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON YOUR SKIN. I GUESS THAT IS NOT SUPER SURPRISING BUT WHAT IS THE RESEARCH TELLING US? >>>. 43 COLLEGE STUDENTS HAD FOUNDATION COVERING HALF OF THEIR FACE. AND HERE IS --. I DON'T THINK IT IS SHOCKING, BUT YOU CAN SAY THAT WEARING MAKEUP IS PROBABLY NOT GREAT BUT ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE DRY SKIN, THEY FIND THAT YOU HAVE LESS MOISTURE, LESS ACTIVITY IN YOUR PORES, AND IT MAY SOUND COUNTERINTUITIVE, BUT THE PORES WERE NOT AS LARGE IN THOSE WHO HAD MAKEUP. A GOOD THING WHEN YOU ARE WEARING MAKEUP AND YOU NEED TO BE ON CAMERA, BUT WHEN YOU'RE WORKING OUT, YOU NEED THAT SWEAT, YOUR SKIN NEEDS TO SWEAT AND SOMETIMES LESS IS MORE, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO MAKEUP >>>. THANK YOU SO MUCH. >>>. LATE FEE: RELEASE CREDIT CARD USERS OF OVERDUE BILLS GETTING A MUCH NEEDED BREAK. >>>. WE HAVE A NEW PLAN ON: >>>. WE HAVE A NEW PLAN ON SAVING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON CREDIT CARD CHARGES. >> CAPPING THE CREDIT CARD LATE FEES AT $8.00.. RIGHT, NOW THEY CAN CHARGE AS MUCH AS 30 BUCKS. THIS WILL SAVE CONSUMERS $10 BILLION >>. HELLO CALEB, WE MISS YOU OVER HERE. THOSE WHO MIGHT BE MAKING THAT LATE PAYMENT: WHAT IS THAT GOING TO MEAN FOR THEM? >> IT MEANS LOWER FEES, AND CREDIT CARD COMPANIES HAVE BEEN CREDIT CARD COMPANIES HAVE BEEN CHARGING FEES FOR YEARS FROM A LOOPHOLE. THAT LIMITED THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT CARD COMPANIES CHARGING. ONLY IF THEY CHARGE $25 ON THE FIRST LATE FEE AND UP TO $41 FOR SUBSEQUENT FEES. ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION, THE FEES ARE ALL THE WAY DOWN TO EIGHT BUCKS CREDIT CARD ISSUERS WITH 1 MILLION OR MORE CUSTOMERS. THAT IS A BIG DEAL. IT WILL SAVE HOUSEHOLDS ABOUT $220 PER YEAR. THAT IS A QUICK TRIP TO THE GROCERY STORE MID-MAY. THEY PASSED A ROLE YESTERDAY. THAT IT WILL TAKE UNTIL MID-MAY. YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT CREDIT CARD COMPANIES DON'T LIKE THIS AT ALL. THOSE HIGHER APR'S ARE IMPACTING THE PROFIT MARGINS OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. >>. CLEARLY, A LOT OF POSITIVES. COULD THERE BE A NEGATIVE. THAT $30 FEE MOTIVATES A LOT OF PEOPLE TO PAY THEIR BILL ON TIME. MAYBE THEY SEE $8.00 AND MAYBE THEY PUT IT OFF AND THEY ARE NOT ON TIME WITH THE PAYMENT. >>. THAT IS THE MORAL HABIT. YOU STILL HAVE MOUNTING CREDIT CARD, DEBT AND INTEREST PAYMENTS. ON TOP OF THAT, YOU STILL HAVE INTEREST PAYMENTS. THOSE ARE 24%. $8.00 IS IN ADDITION TO THAT. SO YOU STILL HAVE LATE CHARGES. THAT WILL REDUCE THE CHARGE. FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IT IS ONLY $8.00 AND NOT $35.00 OR $38.00. >>. WILL WE SEE THESE FEES ELSEWHERE? TO BRIDGE THE GAP ON THE MONEY THEY ARE LOSING. >>. THEY DON'T LIKE THIS ONE BIT. THE AMERICAN BANK ASSOCIATION AND CREDIT CARD COMPANIES SAY THE REDISTRIBUTION THEY WILL HAVE TO REDUCE COMPETITION IN THE MARKET, INCREASE THE COST OF CREDIT AND DENY CREDIT TO SOME PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MAKE UP FOR THOSE CHARGES AND THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO EXTEND CREDIT. THAT SAID CONSUMERS HAVE BEEN PAYING A LOT OF FEES FOR A LOT OF TIME. >>. A NUMBER ONE TIP FOR PEOPLE TRYING TO MANAGE THEIR CREDIT CARD BILLS: >> PAY OFF THAT DEBT FIRST, BECAUSE THAT IS EATING AWAY AT YOUR FUTURE RETURNS.

SHE IS EXPECTED TO MAKE THE WHICH GAVE HALEY ONLY HER SECOND WIN OF THE PRIMARY SEASON. THAT MEANS TRUMP IS NOW TH APPARENT GOP NOMINEE, SETTING UP A LIKELY REMATCH BETWEEN PRESIDENT BIDEN. IN THE FALL LAST NIGHT, TRUMP HELD A VICTOR PARTY AT HIS CLUB, ENFLORIDA GARRETT HAAKE HAS A RECAP OF THE BIG NIGHT. >> NIKKI HALEY'S DECISION TO SUSPEND HER CAMPAIGN ENDS TH REPUBLICAN PRIMARY BUT I DOESN'T HEAL THE RIFF IN THE GOP. HALEY HAS NO PLANS T IMMEDIATELY ENDORSE HER FORMER BOSS WHO, AFTER HIS BIG SUPER TUESDAY NIGHT, WILL TURN HI ATTENTION TO A REMATCH WIT PRESIDENT BIDEN. >> Reporter. THIS MORNING NIKKI HALEY IS SUSPENDING HE CAMPAIGN LEAVING TRUMP, THE ONLY ONE IN THE GOP FIELD HEADED T A REMATCH WITH PRESIDENT BIDEN. HALEY SET TO END HER BID ACCORDING TO A SOURCE WITH DIRECT KNOWLEDGE OF TH DECISION, NBC NEWS LEARNING THAT TRUMP'S FORMER UN AMBASSADOR WILL NO ENDORSE THE FORMER PRESIDENT THIS MORNING. IN THE END, THE REPUBLICAN ELECTORATE IS OVERWHELMINGLY UNITED BEHIND TRUMP. >> THEY CALL IT SUPER TUESDA FOR A REASON. >> Reporter. RACKING UP PRIMAR WINS FROM CALIFORNIA TO MAINE. THE FORMER PRESIDENT MADE NO MENTION OF NIKKI HALEY, EVEN WHEN PRESSED. >> PRESIDENT TRUMP ANY MESSAG FOR NIKKI HALEY? >> Reporter. INSTEAD HE URGE THE GOP TO COME TOGETHER AHEAD OF A POTENTIAL REMATCH WIT PRESIDENT BIDEN THIS FALL. >>. WE HAVE A GREAT REPUBLICA PARTY WITH TREMENDOUS TALENT. WE WANT TO HAVE UNITY AND WE ARE GOING TOHAVE UNITY >>. Reporter. HIS VICTORY I, FUELLED BY OVERWHELMING SUPPOR FROM THE REPUBLICAN BASE. SOME HALEY SUPPORTERS SAY THEY ARE PREPARED TO VOTE FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN IN A REMATCH WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP. >> IF HE DOESN'T ACCEPT TH OUTCOME OF THE LAST ELECTION, THEN HE CAN'T GET AHEAD OF IT. >>. Reporter. PRESIDENT BIDEN CRUISED TO VICTORY AHEAD OF GENERAL ELECTION THAT COULD BE DECIDED BY NARROW MARGINS BUT HE IS FACING ANGRY VOTERS I MICHIGAN WHERE THEY PROTESTE THE GAZA WAR. HE REACHED OUT TO VOTERS LAS NIGHT SAYING TRUMP IS FOCUSED ON REVENGE AND RETRIBUTION AND NO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. FROM SUPER TUESDAY TO STATE OF THE UNION THURSDAY. IF LAS NIGHT'S WAS DONALD TRUMP'S GENERAL ELECTION KICKOFF. LOOK FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN TO OUTLINE THE CHOICE FOR VOTERS TOMORROW NIGHT IN HIS STATE OF THE UNIO ADDRESS. NOW THAT HIS OPPONEN FOR NOVEMBER IS KNOWN. >> WE ARE JOINED IN STUDIO B ANALYST CHUCK TODD GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US >> ABSOLUTELY. >>. FIRST OF ALL REACTION TO NIKKI HALEY. WE ARE EXPECTING HER TO DROP OUT AND THE OTHER BIG TAKE AWAYS. >> LOOK. ACCORDING TO SOURCES WE HAVE CONTACTED HERE, HOW SHE WILL EXIT IS WHAT I WOUL EXPECT. DON'T ENDORS IMMEDIATELY. MAYBE SHE DOESN'T EVER. MAYBE SHE SAYS SHE WILL VOTE FOR THE NOMINEE, WHATEVER IT IS. I DON'T THIN. SHE CAN GO RIGHT BACK TO TRUMP WORLD IF SHE WANTS ANY CREDIBILITY OR IF SHE WANTS FUTURE. SHE IS SORT OF INVESTED IN TRUMP LOSING BECAUSE, THEN SHE CAN BE AN. I TOLD YOU SO REPUBLICAN. I TOLD YOU HE COULDN'T WIN THE GENERAL ELECTION, SO IT WILL BE AWKWARD TO SEE WHAT SHE IS DOING. THE OTHER THING THAT WE OUGHT TO BE LOOKING AT IN THESE REPUBLICAN PRIMARIES IS: I'M NO CONVINCED. THE HALEY VOTERS VOTED FOR TRUMP IN 2020.. I THINK THESE ARE VERY MOTIVATED ANTI-TRUMP VOTERS. IF YOU ARE THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN, YOU LOOK AT THEM AS NEW VOTERS BUT AT LEAST YOU KNOW THOS FOLKS ARE SHOWING UP. THEY SHOWED UP AT A PRIMARY THAT THEY KNEW THEY WOULD LOSE, SO THEY WILL SHOW UP IN TH GENERAL ELECTION. >> GOOD POINT, LET'S PUT A PIN IN NIKKI THI MORNING NOW THAT WE HAVE THE APPAREN NOMINATION. DO YOU SEE MORE OF THE PARTY COALESING BEHIND THE FORMER PRESIDENT? >> WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN IT. IT IS REALLY ONLY NIKKI HALE AND MITCH McCONNELL WHO HAVE NOT ENDORSED HIM THE NEXT SIX WEEKS. JOE BIDEN HAS A REAL ADVANTAGE, A HUGE FINANCIAL ADVANTAGE. TRUMP HAS PERSONAL LEGAL FINANCIAL ISSUES. THE CAMPAIGN HAS ISSUES, SO TRUMP WILL GO ON FUNDRAISING SPREE. THIS IS VERY NORMAL. A NOMINEE HAS TO SPEND ALL O THIS MONEY AND HE HAS TO CATCH UP. BIDEN HAS A CHANCE TO PRESS TH FINANCIAL ADVANTAGE. WHAT IS INTERESTING TO LEARN I? WHAT ARE THE PAIN POINTS THA? THEY THINK YOU KNOW. EVERYTHIN NEGATIVE ABOUT TRUMP IS XOEN BUT WHAT DO THEY THINK I NECESSARY TO REPEAT? THAT IS WHAT LOOKING AT NEXT >>. PRESIDENT BIDEN DIDN'T REALLY HAVE ANY COMPETITION. WHAT IS THE TAKE AWAY OF HIS PERFORMANCE LAST NIGHT >>? I THINK WE OUGHT TO PUT T BED. THE PEOPLE WHO AR HAMMERING ABOUT PRESIDENT BIDE ARE PEOPLE WHO USED TO WORK FO BARACK, OBAMA AND IN WASHINGTON DC. IF DEMOCRATIC VOTERS DIDN'T WANT JOE BIDEN AS THE NOMINEE, THEY HAD PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITY TO SAY: BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT HAPPENED. I THINK JOE BIDEN HAD A STRONGER PRIMARY PERFORMANCE THAN I EXPECTED. SO YOU LOOK AT THE POLLS AND THE BASIS. THERE IS STILL A STRONG ANTI-TRUMP COALITION OUT THERE AND IT SHOULD PUT TO REST. -- DEMOCRATS MAY WISH THEY HAD YOUNGER NOMINEE, BUT YOU CAN SE THEIR ACCEPTANCE >>. ALL RIGHT, STAY TUNED, SIT THERE, BECAUSE WE WILL, AS YOU, A FEW MORE QUESTIONS IN MOMENT >>. BUT FIRST WOEL TURN TO OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, STEV KORNACKI, WHO IS AT THE BIG BOARD GOOD MORNING WALK, US THROUGH TRUMP'S VICTOR LAST NIGHT AND HOW HE PERFORMED AGAINST EXPECTATIONS >>. YEAH, IF YOUR EXPECTATION WERE BASED ON THE EARL PRIMARIES WE SAW IN NE HAMPSHIRE, SOUTH CAROLINA, SOUTH CAROLINA, HER HOME STATE- SHE GO 40% OF THE VOTE. IF THOSE WERE YOUR EXPECTATION IN TERMS OF THE NONTRUMP VOTE, THEN TRUMP EXCEEDED THEM. TAKE A LOOK HERE. I HAVE A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES, STARTING WITH VIRGINIA. VIRGINIA, JUST DEMOGRAPHICALLY, IT BIG SUBURBS OUTSIDE O WASHINGTON DC AROUND RICHMOND. THERE IS A LOT OF DEMOGRAPHICS IN VIRGINIA THAT WOULD BE VERY FAVORABLE TO NIKKI HALEY, BASED ON WHERE SHE WAS PERFORMING WELL- IN SOUTH CAROLINA AND IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. BUT ONLY 35% OF THE VOTE FOR HER IN VIRGINIA AND THE DEMOGRAPHIC PROFILE WA MORE FAVORABLE TO HER THAN I SOUTH CAROLINA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE. SO TOONLY GET 35% HERE. SOME O THE ENERGY THAT WAS BEHIND HER EARLY IN THE CONTESTS SEEMS TO HAVE DISSIPATED LAST NIGHT. LOOK AT NORTH CAROLINA TOO: THERE WAS NO EXPECTATION. THA HALEY WAS GOING TO WIN NORTH CAROLINA BUT AROUND THE TRIANGLE AND TH CHARLOTTE METRO AREA, THERE WERE A LOT OF AREAS ON PAPER WHER HALEY COULD HAVE MADE A LEAD BUT INSTEAD SHE LOSES BY 50%. LOOK AT THE MARGIN IN TEXAS: 6 POINTS. IT WASN'T THAT NIKKI HALEY HAD A CHANCE TO WIN THE STATE. BUT ON THING WE WERE LOOKING AT I, TEXAS HAS 38 CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS AROUND THE STATE. THEY GIVE OUT DELEGATES ON CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS. THERE WERE DISTRICTS IN TH METRO AREA AROUND HOUSTON, METROPLEX, AUSTIN- AGAIN O PAPER. GEMOGRAPHICALLY. YOU LOOK AT THEM AND THINK: IF HALEY WAS GETTING 40% IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, SHE CAN MAYBE WIN THOS DISTRICTS, BUT SHE IS NOT EVEN CLOSE. LOOK AT TRAVIS COUNTY, ONE O THE MOST LIBERAL COUNTIES IN TEXAS, AND TRUMP IS BEATING HALEY BY 24 POINTS. SO THERE WAS AN ENERGY BEHIN HER. IN EARLIER CONTESTS THAT REFLECTED REPUBLICANS OPEN T HER, BUT THEY ARE CONCLUDING THAT TRUMP'S GOT IT AND THEY AR GETTING ON BOARD. THE DEMOCRATS AND INDEPENDENTS WERE DONE WITH THAT. THOSE ARE SOME OF THE FACTOR THAT MAY HAVE BEEN IN PLAY. >>. WHAT DOES SUPER TUESDAY TEL US ABOUT WHERE TRUMP I VULNERABLE WHEN IT COMES TO GENERAL ELECTION? >>. BEYOND SUPER TUESDAY, HE IS VULNERABLE IN VERMONT, BUT WE KNOW HE IS NOT GOING TO WI VERMONT IN NOVEMBER. THE ONLY REAL POTENTIAL SWIN STATE YOU SAW LAST NIGHT WAS NORTH CAROLINA. NOW, NORTH CAROLINA WAS A TRUMP STATE BY 87,000 VOTES IN 2020, DOWN A BIT FROM 2016 PUT. THIS IS PROBABLY STILL A REACH FOR DEMOCRATS IF THEY WILL MAKE RUN FOR NORTH CAROLINA. IT IS HARD TO LOOK AT THES RESULTS. THERE ARE AREAS HERE YOU WOULD HAVE LOOKED AT, PARTICULARLY AROUND CHARLOTTE- OUTSIDE OF CHARLOTTE, UNION COUNTY- A BIG BEDROOM COUNTY, REPUBLICAN. BUT AGAIN, IT IS SUBURBAN IN NATURE AND THEN YOU THOUGHT MAYBE HALEY WOULD MAKE A GOOD NUMBER FOR TRUMP IN UNION COUNTY. SO I DON'T THINK YOU CAN SEE I ON THE MAP, BUT WE KNOW FROM NINE YEARS THAT TRUMP'S PROBLEM IS IN THE SUBURBS. >> GREAT TO TALK TO YOU ON THI WEDNESDAY. >>. CHUCK, LET'S BRING YOU BACK IN HERE. YOU MENTIONED THE NEXT SIX WEEKS ARE CRITICAL AND YOU WROTE A PIECE ABOUT IT. IS IT JUST ABOUT THE MONEY? WE HAVE EIGHT FULL MONTHS HERE. WHAT COULD WE SEE HAPPEN IN TH NEXT FEW WEEKS? >>. I THINK, BECAUSE THERE ARE A FEW THINGS THAT WILL B HAPPENING HERE FOR BIDEN. THA ARE OPPORTUNITY AND POTENTIA RISKS. THE STATE OF THE UNION TO B FRANK PERFORMANCE MATTERS HERE. STYLE POINTS MATTER. PEOPLE HATE HEARING THAT, BUT I THIS CASE PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT. IF HE CAN PERFORM. IT MAY BE UNFAIR, BUT THAT'S WHAT TELEVISION DID. HE HAS TO PERFORM. WE SAW HIM DO IT A YEAR AGO. IT IS NOT AS IF THIS ISN'T I HIS WHEEL HOUSE. YOU HAVE THE POTENTIAL TESTIMONY OF THE SPECIAL COUNSEL HUR WHAT HE SAID IN RELEASING THE TRANSCRIPTS. THESE WILL BE UNCOMFORTABLE MOMENTS. WHAT WE WILL FIND OUT IS THINK. THE BIGGEST CHALLENG BIDEN AND TRUMP HAVE IS WHAT DOES THE DAY AFTER LOOK LIKE? HOW ARE YOU -- DO YOU CREDIBLY MAKE THE CASE THAT YOU WIL BRING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER? WILL YOU BOW ABLE TO KNI EVERYTHING TOGETHER? BIDEN REALLY HAD THAT MESSAG FOUR YEARS AGO. IT IS HARDER MESSAGE AS AN INCUMBENT TO MAKE HERE. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I'M WATCHING. WHAT IS HIS BRING TH COUNTRY TOGETHER MESSAGE? I THINK THERE IS A SMALL SLICE OF UNDECISIVE VOTERS. >>. GREAT TO HAVE YOU >>>. LAWYERS FOR TRUMP AR SEEKING A NEW TRIAL IN THE E JEAN CARROLL DEFAMATION CASE. THE ATTORNEYS FILED A MOTION I A NEW YORK COURT YESTERDAY. THEY ARE ARGUING IT WA PREJUDICIAL TO EXCLUDE PART OF TRUMP'S TESTIMONY ON HIS STATE OF MIND WHEN HE MADE COMMENT ABOUT CARROLL. A JURY FOUND HE MUST PAY $83 MILLION FOR DEFAMING HER. HER ATTORNEYS HAVE DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THE FILING >>>. WE ARE FOLLOWING THE MASSIVE AND DEADLY EXPLOSION THAT ROCKED A DISTRIBUTION CENTER OUTSIDE OF DETROIT MONDAY NIGHT. INVESTIGATORS ARE WORKING TO FIND OUT WHAT CAUSED THE BLAST THAT LED TO THE DEATH OF A TEENAGER AND ONE INJURED. FIREFIGHTER ADRIENNE BROADDUS IS JOINING U NOW WITH MORE. >>. Reporter. GOOD MORNING TO YOU. DAYLIGHT IS PROVIDING SOME ASSISTANCE. ALL THAT IS LEFT IS THE SEEN THAT ONCE IDENTIFIED THE BUILDING DESTROYED IN THE FIRE. POLICE HAVE QUESTIONED EMPLOYEES WHO WERE INSIDE BUT MANAGED TO ESCAPE. INVESTIGATORS WANT TO KNOW WHA THEY HEARD AND WHAT THEY SAW. THIS MORNING FIRE INVESTIGATORS ARE EXPECTED TO RETURN TO TH SCENE. THERE ARE SOME BIG KEY QUESTIONS. THIS MORNING, INVESTIGATORS ARE TRYING TO DETERMINE WHAT STARTED BURNING THE FIRE OR EXPLOSION. THE BUILDING SHARED BY A SMOKE SHOP AND DISTRIBUTORS WHO SUPPLY VAPE PRODUCTS. AUTHORITIES SAY IT WAS SUPPOSE TO BE A RETAIL OPERATION. INSTEAD INSIDE THE ROOM WAS A PALLET OF NITROUS OXIDE, AN LIGHTER FLUID. THE BUSINESS JUST RECEIVED A SEMI LOAD OF BUTANE CANISTERS, HALF REMAINED. >>. THEY WERE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE THE CANISTERS. >>. Reporter. THAT'S NOT ALL. >>. THERE WERE OVER 100,000 VAP PENS THAT OBVIOUSLY HAD LITHIU BATTERIES INSIDE. >>. Reporter. RESIDENTS I CLINTON TOWNSHIP THOUGHT THE WERE UNDER ATTACK. >> YOI KNOW IF WE WERE AT WAR. >>. Reporter. THE BLAST SCATTERED DEBRIS AS FAR AS TWO MILES AWAY. >>. WE HAVE A LOT OF DEBRIS I THE AIR. >>. Reporter. CANISTERS CONTAINING BUTANE, NITROUS OXIDE AND OTHER GAS LAUNCHED INTO TH SKY ONE FIREFIGHTER INJURED WHEN SHRAPNEL BROKE THE WINDSHIELD OF HIS VEHICLE. A 19-YEAR-OLD MALE AWAY FROM THE BUILDING DIED FROM A HEA INJURY >>. THE PERSON WAS ESSENTIALL ABOUT A QUARTER MILE DOWN TH ROAD HERE AND DID SUFFER INJURIES FROM THE FLYING CANISTER >>. Reporter. THE BUSINESS OWNERS ARE COOPERATING WITH AUTHORITIES BUT HAVE NOT RESPONDED TO CALL FROM NBC NEWS. FIRE CHIEF DUNCAN HAS SEEN A LOT BUT THIS IS A FIRST. >>. I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS IN MY 25 YEARS. >>. Reporter. MORE THAN 24 HOUR LATER, THERE ARE STILL HOT SPOTS BURNING. WE HAVE SEEN FLAMES OVERNIGH AND EVEN THIS MORNING A BIG WARNING FOR RESIDENT HERE: THE CANISTERS FLYING THROUGH THE AIR. WE KNOW THEY LANDED AND SCATTERED TWO MILES AWAY. IF ANYONE SEES THEM IN THEIR YARD OR ON THE SIDEWALKS, DO NOT PICK THEM UP. INVESTIGATORS SAY THEY COULD STILL EXPLODE. >>. ALL RIGHT, IMPORTAN INFORMATION, THANK YOU. >>>. IN CAIRO THIS MORNING, EFFORTS ARE INTENSIFYING T REACH, A CEASE FIRE AGREEMENT I GAZA BEFORE THE START OF RAMADAN, AS TALKS ENDED WITHOUT A BREAK THROUGH THE SIX WEEK DEAL WOULD SEE TH RELEASE OF SOME ISRAELI HOSTAGES AND PALESTINIAN PRISONERS AND AN INCREASE IN AID TO GAZA' STARVING POPULATION. JOINING US IS THE MIDDLE EAS DIRECTOR OF THE INTERNATIONA COMMUNITIES ORGANIZATION. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US FIRST. WHAT IS YOUR ASSESSMENT OF WHERE WE ARE AT WITH TH CEASE FIRE, HOSTAGE TALKS AND HOW IMPORTANT IS IT TO GET A DEA DONE SOON? >>. IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT T GET A DEAL DONE SOON. I WISH I COULD BE OPTIMISTIC, BUT I'M NOT. THEY ARE FOCUSED ON ONE OF THEIR DEMANDS ON ISRAEL WHICH IS WAY BEYOND WHAT THE NETANYAH GOVERNMENT CAN EXPECT TO AGREE TO, INCLUDING THE BIGGEST NAMES OF THE ISRAELI MURDERS EXPECTE TO BE RELEASED TO END THE WAR. WITHDRAW FROM GAZA TALKS WERE OF A SIX WEEK CEASE FIRE WITHOUT THE ISRAELI OBLIGATION TO END THE WAR, BUT IT SEEMS THAT HAMAS IS BACK TRACKING. IT IS NOT COMPLETELY CLEAR WHY THEY ARE DOING THIS. THEY NEED A CEASE FIRE AS MUCH AS ISRAEL DOES- EVEN MORE THAN ISRAEL DOES, AND RAMADAN IS FOUR DAYS AWAY. >>. YOU WROTE A COLUMN YESTERDA FOR THE TIMES OF ISRAEL IN WHICH YOU OUTLINED A POSSIBL DIPLOMATIC WAY OF ENDING THE WAR. YOU SAID THAT THE UNITED STATE AND OTHERS SHOULD RECOGNIZE PALESTINIAN STATE AND REMOVE ISRAEL'S VETO. HOW HARD WOULD THAT BE IN THIS CLIMATE AND EXPLAIN WHY THAT IS SUCH A IMPORTANT STEP? >>. ISRAEL CAN DEFEAT HAMAS MILITARILY AND PREVENT HAMAS FROM GOVERNING THE GAZA STRIP, BUT ISRAEL CANNOT DEFEAT THE IDEA THAT ISRAEL HIT THE STRIP AND KILLED PALESTINIANS, THE MORE ISRAEL STAYS THE MOR. THE STRENGTH OF THE INSURGEANC AGAINST THE ISRAELI ARMY. HAMAS SAYS: FREEDOM FOR THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE IN EXCHANGE FOR ISRAELI SECURITIES. 139 COUNTRIES HAVE RECOGNIZE THE STATE OF PALESTINE. ABOUT 160 COUNTRIES HAVE RECOGNIZED THE STATE OF ISRAEL. WE NEED ALL MEMBERS OF THE UNITED NATIONS TO RECOGNIZE BOTH STATES IN ORDER TO DEMONSTRATE TO THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE, AN THE ISRAELI PEOPLE, THAT TH INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS SERIOUS ABOUT PEACE. WE HAVE A 30 YEAR PEACE PROCES CALLING FOR A TWO STAT SOLUTIONS, WHERE MOST COUNTRIES, THE BIG COUNTRIES, HAVE ONLY RECOGNIZED ISRAEL. IA NEED TO MAKE PALESTINE REAL FOR PALESTINIANS AND GIV ASSURANCES TO ISRAEL THAT THEY WILL HAVE SECURITY >>. OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS, W HAVE SEEN A SHIFT IN TONE FROM THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION TOWARDS ISRAEL. WE HAD VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS CRITICIZING ISRAEL OVER WHAT I NOW THIS TOTAL HUMANITARIA CATASTROPHE IN GAZA. WE ARE ALSO SEEING PRESSUR XRTED BY US OFFICIALS TO LET MORE AID IN AS WE KEEP SEEIN THAT STOPPED AT THEBOARDER. WHAT DOES THIS SAY ABOUT THE STATE OF US ISRAELI RELATIONS? >>. I THINK WE ARE FACING THE POSSIBILITY OF ACTION ON THE LEFT: 20% ON THE GAZA STRIP. MILLIONS ARE CROWDED IN LIVING IN TENT CITIES, SOME ARE IN THE STREETS WITHOU HOMES. A LOT OF DEATHS OF INNOCEN CHIRP HAVE TAKEN PLACE OVER TH LAST FIVE MONTHS OF THE WAR. WE STILL HAVE 130 HOSTAGES BEING HELD BY HAMAS. MORE THAN HALF OF THEM ARE BELIEVED TO BE DEAD. I THINK THE UNITED STATES IS SENDING A CLEAR MESSAGE THAT THE WAR NEEDS TO COME TO AN END. WE NEED A CEASE FIRE. RAMADAN IS A VERY SENSITIV MONTH THROUGHOUT THE REGION. I THINK THE UNITED STATES IS CALLING THE SHOTS RIGHT. WE NEED TO PUT PRESSURE ON BOT SIDES TO GET A CEASE FIRE NOW. WHAT I SUGGESTED IN MY ARTICLE IS PERHAPS THE SIX WEEK COOLIN OFF PERIOD COULD. ALLOW MEDIATORS, UNITED STATES AND OTHERS TO COME UP WITH DIPLOMATIC END TO THE WAR, SO W DO NOT NEED TO CONTINU FIGHTING. >> THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THI MORNING. WE APPRECIATE IT. >>. THANK YOU. >>>. LET'S TURN TO WEATHER. NOW YOU GOT TO GRAB THE RAIN BOOTS AGAIN. WE ARE KEEPING AN EYE ON STORM IN THE EAST. >>. ANGIE LASSMAN IS HERE WITH LOOK AHEAD. >> GOOD MORNING.

HE, AGGRESSIVE, TOOK ON CRITICS AND THE MAN HE REFERRED TO AS MY PREDECESSOR, THAT OF COURSE, IS FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, THE PRESUMPTIVE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE, AND HE FOCUSED ON ISSUES DOMESTICLY INCLUDING ABORTION RIGHTS, IVF AND ECONOMY, AND THE SOUTHERN BORDER AND THE WAR BETWEEN ISRAEL AND HAMAS. THE PRESIDENT ALSO ADDRESSED HIS AGE, LOOKING TO SEIZE THE CONCERNS OF VOTERS AND HIS PARTIES. HE BEGAN HIS REMARKS ADDRESSING THE STATE OF AMERICAN DEMOCRACY, REFLECTING ON JANUARY 6th ATTACK ON CAPITOL, TWO WEEKS BEFORE HE WAS INAUGURATED. >>. HISTORY IS WATCHING, JUST LIKE HISTORY WATCHED THEE YEARS ON JANUARY 6th, WHEN THEY PLACED A DAGGER TO THE THROAT OF AMERICAN DEMOCRACY. DEMOCRACY PREVAILS. WE MUST BE HONEST. A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY MUST BE DEFENDED. >>. WE HAVE FULL COVERAGE OF THE STATE OF THE UNION, INCLUDING REACTION FROM CAPITOL HILL AND THE MIDDLE EAST AND LOOK AT IMPLICATIONS. THE SPEECH ON THE GENERAL ELECTION. LET'S BEGIN WITH NBC NEWS, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT AARON, GILCHRIST AND RAF SANCHEZ. IN TEL AVIV, ISRAEL AARON, THE PRESIDENT, SET A DEFIANT TONE FROM THE OUTSET. WALK US THROUGH THE HIGHLIGHTS OF THE STATE OF THE UNION. >>. Reporter. GOOD MORNING. I THINK FOLKS WHO ARE SUPPORTERS OF PRESIDENT BIDEN, AS RECENTLY AS DECEMBER, ASKED TO SEE A FEISTIER JOE BIDEN. TAKE STAGES ACROSS AMERICA AND I THINK THEIR OPINION HAS BEEN AND IS TODAY THAT HE DELIVERED ON, THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO SEE A JOE BIDEN WHO WAS ENERGETIC, ANSWERING THE CONCERNS ABOUT HIS AGE AND HIS PHYSICAL FITNESS, SORT OF DO WHAT HE'S BEEN DOING ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL AND ADDRESS SOME OF THE OTHER CONCERNS THAT HAVE COME UP ABOUT THE PRESIDENT BIDEN. YOU SAW HIM STANDING THERE FOR 68 MINUTES, DELIVER THE SPEECH TOE TO TOE AT TIMES, WITH REPUBLICANS IN THE ROOM, GOING BACK AND FORTH WITH THEM, AND ALSO, AS YOU NOTED, ADDRESSING SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT THE PRESIDENT BELIEVES HE'S HAD SUCCESS ON IN THE THREE YEARS HE HAS BEEN IN OFFICE AND SOME OF THE THINGS HE WANTS TO DO, THE JOB HE WANTS TO FINISH, AS HE SAID, SEVERAL TIMES GOING FORWARD. THIS WAS THE SPEECH THAT WAS A REPORT CARD ON THE NATION IN TERMS OF WHAT WE EXPECT FROM THE STATE OF THE UNION, AND VERY MUCH HAD ONE OF THE CAMPAIGN SPEECH. WE HEARD THE PRESIDENT TALK ABOUT ABORTION IN PARTICULAR AND DIRECT, SOME OF THE COMMENTS AT THE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES WHO WERE SITTING IN THE FRONT ROW. THEY, TYPICALLY, ARE STONE FACED AND DON'T RESPOND TO THINGS OR APPLAUD. HERE'S MOMENT FROM THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH LAST NIGHT >> NO BRAG GOING OVERTURNING. ROE V WADE HAS NO CLUE ABOUT THE POWER OF WOMEN. THEY FOUND OUT WHEN REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM WAS ON THE BALLOT AND WE WILL WIN, BEGIN IN 2024.. TUNE IN AMERICAN PEOPLE SEND ME TO CONGRESS TO SUPPORT THE RIGHT CHOICE AND I PROMISE I WILL RESTORE ROE V WADE AS A LAW OF THE LAND AGAIN. >>. Reporter. AND NOW, AS TYPICALLY THE CASE AFTER THE STATE OF THE UNION, THE PRESIDENT HITS THE ROAD. HE WILL IN PENNSYLVANIA TODAY FOR A CAMPAIGN EVENT AND IN GEORGIA TOMORROW FOR ANOTHER EVENT. AT THE SAME TIME, MANY MEMBERS OF THE ADMINISTRATION, SECRETARYS AND OTHER PEOPLE IN LEADERSHIP POSITIONS ARE HITTING THE ROAD TO DELIVER THE MESSAGE. >>. FOLLOWING THE SPEAK, WE HEARD THE GOP RESPONSE AND ALABAMA FRESHMAN SENATOR KATIE BRITT TELL US ABOUT HER MESSAGE. >>. Reporter. YEAH, THE 42-YEAR OLD SENATOR FROM ALABAMA, SHARP, CONTRAST IN AGE TO PRESIDENT BIDEN AT 81, DELIVERED THE RESPONSE THAT WAS AT TIMES INTENSE AND PRESENTED. A UNITED STATES THAT IS IN DESPAIR. INI MANY WAYS AND POINTED. SHE BELIEVES THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS THE PARTY OF FAMILY AND IS THE PARTY THAT WILL CREATE ECONOMIC PROSPERITY ACROSS THE NATION, AND SHE PRESENTED PRESIDENT BIDEN AS HER WORDS- SOMEONE WHO IS A LEADER, WHO IS DITHERING AND DIMINISHED AND NOT IN COMMAND. AND I WANT YOU TO HEAR WHAT SHE SAID IN HER REMARKS LAST NIGHT: >>. WHAT WE SAW WAS THE PERFORMANCE OF A PERMANENT POLITICIAN WHO HAS ACTUALLY BEEN IN OFFICE FOR LONGER THAN I'VE BEEN ALIVE. ONE THING WAS QUITE CLEAR THOUGH. PRESIDENT BIDEN JUST DOESN'T GET IT. PRESIDENT BIDEN'S BORDER POLICIES ARE A DISGRACE. THIS CRISIS IS DESPICABLE AND THE TRUTH IS IT IS ALMOST ENTIRELY PREVENTIBLE. >>. Reporter. SHE MADE THE CASE. THE PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS THE AUTHORITY AND POWER TO SECURE THE BORDER BY EXECUTIVE ORDER, AND THE PRESIDENT OF COURSE, IN HIS SPEECH, SAID: CONGRESS NEEDS TO DELIVER A BORDER LEGISLATION PACKAGE THAT HAS SOON BROAD SUPPORT IN THE CONGRESS. AND AT THIS POINT, SHE NEVER- AND THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T EITHER. SHE NEVER- IDENTIFIED FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP BY NAME, BUT MADE THE CASE. HE WOULD SUPPORT POLICIES, THE NATION WOULD APPROVE AND HE SHOULD BE REELECTED. >>. LET'S BRING YOU INTO THE CONVERSATION RAF, BECAUSE INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS ARE SO IMPORTANT. PRESIDENT BIDEN DISCUSSED THE WAR BETWEEN ISRAEL AND HAMAS AND CONTINUED TO CALL FOR AN IMMEDIATE, TEMPORARY CEASE-FIRE. HOW DID HE ADDRESS THIS NOW FIVE MONTH-LONG WAR? >>. Reporter. HE STARTED THE SECTION OF HIS SPEECH BY TELLING THE HORRORS OF OCTOBER 7th, AND 1200 ISRAELIS MASSACRED, AND HE REMINDED THE AUDIENCE: THIS IS THE LARGEST MASSACRE SINCE THE HOLOCAUST, BUT TURNS THE HORRORS THAT HAVE BEEN UNFOLDING IN GAZA OVER THE LAST FIVE MONTHS AND CONTINUES TO UNFOLD TODAY: 30,000 PEOPLE KILLED. HE SAID THE MAJORITY OF WHOM ARE CIVILIANS, AND HE TALKED ABOUT THE URGENT NEED TO GET MORE HUMANITARIAN AID INTO GAZA TO FEND OFF A LOOMING FAMINE. TAKE A LISTEN. >>. NO, IT MAY NOT LOOK LIKE IT, BUT I BEEN AROUND A WHILE. WHEN YOU GET TO BE MY AGE, CERTAIN THINGS ARE CLEARER THAN EVER. I HAVE BEEN TOLD. I AM TOO OLD, DESERVED TO BE EQUALLY, AND NEVER FULLY LIVED UP TO THE IDEA. WE NEVER WACKED AWAY FROM IT EITHER, AND I WON'T WALK AWAY FROM IT NOW >>. Reporter. THAT WAS NOT THE RIGHT SOUNDS, BUT HE TALKED ABOUT THE URGENT NEEDS TO GET MORE HUMANITARIAN AID INTO GAZA AND HE SAID THAT, ULTIMATELY, THE ONLY SOLUTION THAT'S GOING TO BRING PEACE TO ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS IS A TWO-STATE SOLUTION, AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT PUTS HIM IN A DIRECT DIPLOMATIC POLITICAL COLLISION COURSE WITH THE FAR RIGHT GOVERNMENT OF BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, WHO SAYS THEY WILL NOT ACCEPT A TWO STATE SOLUTION AT ANY TIME, AND ESPECIALLY NOT AFTER OCTOBER 7th. >>. RAF THANKS FOR ROLLING WITH THAT AND PARAPHRASING THAT COMMENT ON HIS AGE IS A CONVERSATION WE WILL HAVE IN A MOMENT. BUT BACK TO GAZA. WE KNOW 16 WITH 52,000 MEALS WERE DROPPED AS PART OF A JOINT US- JORDANIAN OPERATION TO BRING AID TO GAZA. BUT ONE OF THE BIG PARTS OF THE SPEECH IS DIRECTING THE US MILITARY TO ESTABLISH A PIER ON THE COAST OF GAZA FOR THE DELIVERY OF AID. IS THAT SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AND IF SO, HOW? >>. Reporter SAVANNAH. THE US BUNCH A EUROPEAN ALLIES, UAE PUT OUT A STATEMENT THIS MORNING WHERE THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THIS OPERATION IS GOING TO BE COMPLEX AND THERE WILL NEED TO BE ADJUSTMENTS. AND THEY SAY IT'S NECESSARY TO GET THAT AID INTO GAZA. THE BROAD OUTLINE AID WILL BE LOADED ONTO SHIPS IN CYPRESS AND INSPECTED BY ISRAELI OFFICIALS THERE AND CARRIED ON THE SHIPS ACROSS THE MEDITERRANEAN AND WILL REACH THE AMERICAN MILITARY PIER JUST OFF THE COAST OF GAZA AND FROM THERE WILL BE DELIVERED ONTO LANDS. THE PRESIDENT STRESSED. THERE WILL NOT BE AMERICAN MILITARY BOOTS ON THE GROUND INSIDE GAZA AS PART OF THIS OPERATION. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THIS IS NOT DANGEROUS. YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE US SERVICE MEMBERS JUST OFF THE COAST OF AN ACTIVE WAR ZONE, AND THEY WILL BE WITHIN RANGE OF THE WEAPONS OF HAMAS, OF ISLAMIC JIHAD, SUPPORTED BY IRAN, SIMILAR TO THE MILITANT GROUPS. WE HAVE SEEN TAKING SHOTS AT US FORCES ALL ACROSS THE MIDDLE EAST. PRESIDENT BIDEN SAYS THIS IS HIS COMMITMENT TO MAKING SURE THAT AID GETS THROUGH AND UNLIKE THE AIRDROPS WHICH WE HAVE BEEN SEEING OVER THE LAST WEEK OR SO, SHIPS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO CARRY REALLY VERY LARGE AMOUNTS OF AID IN A SINGLE GO BUT WE WILL SEE HOW LONG IT TAKES TO GET THIS PIER UP AND RUNNING AND WHAT KIND OF DELIVERY, WHAT KIND OF PROBLEMS IT FACES ONCE IT IS UP GUYS >>. AARON AND RAF, THANKS FOR KICKING US OFF THIS HOUR. >>>. WE ARE JOINED BY SENIOR NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER AND FORM ARE OBAMA SPEECH RIGHTER AND BEST SETH AUTHOR. JOHN, I WILL GET STARTED WITH YOU. THE PRESIDENT IS GEARING UP FOR AN ELECTION REMATCH. THIS FALL AGAINST DONALD TRUMP AND ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE JUST MENTIONED A MOMENT AGO, THERE'S BEEN CONCERNS RAISED ABOUT HIS AGE, AS HE ES FOR THE SECOND TERM. WALK US THROUGH THE TONE THE PRESIDENT SAID IN HIS ROW MARKS AS HE TRIED TO EASE WORRIES ABOUT HIS MENTAL FITNESS. >>. TWO PARTS OF THAT. THE FIRST IS HE WAS TALKING ABOUT IT. AS YOU SAW THE QUOTE A MOMENT AGO. THE PRESIDENT WAS TALKED ABOUT IT AND BASICALLY MADE A POINT THAT AMERICANS SHOULD BE RESPECTED THROUGHOUT THEIR LIVES, AND I THINK THAT'S, YOU KNOW, SORT OF A PLAY FOR SYMPATHY. BUT THE OTHER PIECE IS- AND I ONE THAT'S, MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE WORDS THAT COME OUT OF HIS MOUTH. WAS THE VIGOR LAST NIGHT. THIS WAS JOE BIDEN IN CAMPAIGN MODE, IN FULL CAMPAIGN MODE, SOMEONE WHO WON TEN CONSECUTIVE ELECTIONS. HE WON, AND HE IS USED TO BE ON THE STUMP, AND IT WAS MORE FORCEFUL THAN YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN FROM HIM IN THE ENSENATE DAYS BUT SIMILAR IN TERMS OF JUST ENERGY HE HAS AND, HONESTLY, THERE'S NOTHING HE CAN DO BETTER THAN SHOW THAT ENERGY THAT HIS CRITICS SAY HE DOESN'T HAVE, AND SHOW THE CAPACITY THAT HIS CRITICS SAY HE DOESN'T HAVE. AND WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A COUPLE OF FUMBLES FROM THE PODIUM LAST NIGHT WHERE HE FELL INTO A STRONG WORDS OF JOE BIDEN: >>. DAVID, THE PRESIDENT, ADDRESSED REPUBLICAN HECKLERS SOMETHING WE DISCUSSED WITH YOU YESTERDAY. AT TIMES HE SEEMED RELISH THE EXCHANGES AND STRUGGLED A LITTLE MORE IN THE EXCHANGE ON IMMIGRATION WITH MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE BUT HOW DID HE DID TAKING ON THAT ISSUE AND WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE SPEECH OVERALL? >>. WELL, FIRST, THANKS FOR HAVING ME BACK THIS MORNING. I THINK WHEN WE TALKED YESTERDAY THE PREVIEW OF THE SPEECH, THERE WAS A QUESTION, OPEN QUESTION, OF IF A MOMENT LIKE THAT CAME, WHO WOULD LOOK IN COMMAND REPUBLICAN ARGUMENTS FOR DONALD TRUMP'S IS. WHEN THE MOMENT COMES, HE IS NOT UP TO THE TASK. I WOULD SAY TO ANYBODY THIS MORNING IS WHO STILL FEELS THAT WAY IS, GO LOOK AT THE TAPE. AND I THINK THAT'S A HUGE DIFFERENCE. I THINK POLITICALLY WE ARE IN A DIFFERENT PLACE THIS MORNING THAN WE WERE YESTERDAY BECAUSE JOE BIDEN. YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY I AM A DEMOCRAT AND WILL BE EXCITED WHEN HE GOES TOE TO TOE WITH THE HECKLERS. BUT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT DEFENDING SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICAID A MOMENT YOU MENTIONED WITH MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE, WHEN HE SHOWED EMPATHY. PEOPLE SAID HE WILL NEVER SAY THE NAME OF SOMEONE MURDERED BY AN UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANT. AND IN FACT HE DID AND HE TALKED DIRECTLY TO HER PARENTS AND SAID: I LOST CHILDREN TOO. SO HE SHOWED THE EMPATHY. THAT ONE-ON-ONE QUALITY. THAT IS REALLY BIDEN'S BEST QUALITY AS POLITICIAN. HE GOT A LOT OF WORK DONE IN ONE NIGHT AND I THINK DEMOCRATS- AND REALLY ANYBODY WORRIED ABOUT A SECOND TRUMP TERM- IS HAPPY THIS MORNING. >>. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP, AND PRESIDENT BIDEN ALLUDED TO HIM MORE THAN A DOZEN TIMES WITHOUT MENTIONING HIS HIM IN- AND WE MENTIONED IT WAS A THEME IN THE GOP- RESPONSE, AS WELL YOU KIND OF SAY, THAT THESE REMARKS AMOUNTED TO ESSENTIALLY A FIERY CAMPAIGN STUMP SPEECH. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR WHAT HE AHEAD OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS >> IT'S GOING TO BE NOTHING BUT POLITICS FROM HERE ON OUT TO NOVEMBER. I KNOW PEOPLE FEEL LIKE IT'S THAT WAY BUT HERE'S PRESIDENT STANDING IN FRONT OFF THE CONGRESS, AND YOU KNOW THE LAST YEAR, THE WHAT COULD BE THE LAST YEAR OF HIS PRESIDENCY, AND IT WAS UNUSUAL TONE, TYPICALLY. WHAT YOU SEE IS AT LEAST A VEILED POLITICS, SOME SORT OF PRETENSE THAT THEY ARE NOT-GAUGED TOTALLY IN POLITICS AND THEY WOULD LIKE CONGRESS TO REALLY WORK WITH THEM TO GET THINGS DONE. THIS CASE, THAT WAS ALMOST AN AFTER THOUGHT. THIS WAS VERY MUCH A POLITICAL SPEECH. AND HE SAID: PRESIDENT BIDEN DIDN'T SAY FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S NAME BUT HE DID REFER TO HIM. THE ENTIRE SPEECH WAS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP >> DAVID, WITH THE ELECTION NOW SEVERAL MONTHS AHEAD, HOLES SHOW. THIS IS GOING TO BE A TIGHT ONE UNTIL THE VERY END. WHAT DO YOU THINK THE PRESIDENT NEEDS TO DO TO PERSUADE VOTERS, ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO VOTED FOR HIM FOUR YEARS AGO, THAT ARE ON THE FENCE RIGHT NOW TO TRY TO GIVE HIM FOUR MORE YEARS. >>. WELL THINK, THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT JOE BIDEN CAN DO IS KEEP DOING WHAT HE DID LAST NIGHT. IF YOU LOOK AT THE POLLING IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE SPEECH AMONG SPEECH WATCHERS, I BELIEVE 45% SAID THAT THE PRESIDENT'S POLICIES WOULD PUT THE COUNTRY ON THE RIGHT TRACK. THAT WAS BEFORE THE SPEECH. AFTER THE SPEECH IT WAS UP TO 62%- 17% IN JUST ONE SPEECH AND CLEAR MAJORITY. SO IF HE CAN CONTINUE TO DO THAT, BOTH DEMONSTRATE THAT HE IS THE KIND OF LEADER THAT WE NEED. BUT ALSO A POLICY AGENDA THAT IS SHARP CONTRAST TO THE ONE BEING OFFERED BY, AS JOHN POINTED OUT, HIS PREDECESSOR. THAT'S WAY TO AHEAD AND TO WIN DECISIVELY IF HE GETS THE MESSAGE OUT THERE. >>. JOHN AND DAVID, THANKS FOR JOINING US. >>>. NBC NEWS REPORTER HAS MORE REACTION FROM CAPITOL HILL. SO GARY REPUBLICANS LEFT THE CHAMBER TELLING NBC NEWS. THEY THOUGHT THE SPEECH WAS POLITICALLY DEVISIVE, WHAT WERE SOME OF THE STRONGEST REACTIONS. >>. Reporter. GOOD MORNING. THIS IS PART PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS AND CAMPAIGN SPEECH AS YOU WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT. IT COMES DOWN TO A GUY WOULD LIKE TO GET REELECTED BUT HALF THE ROOM VERY MUCH WOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM NOT GET REELECTED AND WOULD LIKE DONALD TRUMP IN OFFICE. THERE WAS A CONVERSATION OF PARTISAN ISSUES- UKRAINE, ISRAEL, THE BORDER AND ONE OF THE STRONGEST REACTIONS. YOU SAW THE ENTIRE SPEECH. IT WAS LEADER MIKE HOUSE SPEAKER JOHNSON, DIRECTLY BEHIND THE PRESIDENT. YOU SAW THE FACIAL EXPRESSIONS. YOU SAW THE HEAD NODDING AND SHAKING OF THE HEAD WHEN HE DISAGREED WITH SOMETHING. THIS IS WHAT SAID AFTERWARDS TO REPORTERS: >>. IT WAS A COMPLETELY HYPERPARTISAN SPEECH. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DESCRIBE IT- A CAMPAIGN SPEECH, AND VITRIOLIC ONE AT THAT. SO PEOPLE ARE SAYING: I MADE FUNNY FACIAL EXPRESSION. I TRIED TO KEEP A POKER FACE. I DISAGREED WITH SO MUCH OF WHAT HE SAID AND I THINK PEOPLE AT HOME DID AS WELL >>. Reporter. SENATOR ROMNEY HAD A REACTION. HE SAID: IF IT WAS HIS STATE OF THE UNION, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TEN MINUTES LONG. >>. WE SAW HOUSE DEMOCRATS WEARING WHITE TO SIGNAL SUPPORT FOR ABORTION RIGHTS AND WOMEN'S RIGHTS. WHAT HAS BIDEN'S PARTY BEEN SAYING? DID HE GIVE THEM WHAT THEY WANTED TO HEAR ON THAT POINT? >>. Reporter. AS WE KNOW, THE LARGEST ISSUE, AS IT RELATES TO WHAT VOTERS REALLY CARE ABOUT. WE SAW IT IN THE MIDTERMS IN 2022 AND SAW IT IN STATEWIDE ELECTIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN 2023. AND WE ARE POUNDED HERE IN 2024, AND DONALD TRUMP IS VERY PLEASED WITH THE FACT THAT HE IS IS THE REASON WHY ROE VERSUS WADE WAS OVERTURNED WITH THE ELECTION AS A SELECTION OF THE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES. JOE BIDEN SAID HE WANTS TO LEGALIZE IT ROE VERSUS WADE AND BRING THAT BACK INTO THE CONVERSATION SHOULD HE GET REELECTED >>. GARY QUICK HERE. LET'S TURN TO THE DEAL TO AVERT A GOVERNMENT SHUT DOWN. HOUSE PASSED THE FIRST OF SEVERAL FUNDING PACKAGES. CONGUESS NEEDS TO PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING. THEY WILL HEAD TO THE SENATE FOR PASSAGE BEFORE TONIGHT'S DEADLINE. WHAT'S IN IT? WILL IT GET THROUGH? >>. Reporter. IT'S NOT FUN AND GAMES. THEY ARE GETTING DOWN TO SERIOUS BUSINESS AND THAT'S FUND THE GOVERNMENT FIRST PART. TONIGHT WE EXPECT THEM TO MAKE THE PASSAGE, AND THERE WERE MULTIPLE PARTS OF THE GOVERNMENT THAT WILL BE FUNDED THIS FRIDAY AND TODAY IS INCLUDING AGRICULTURE AND ENERGY, AND HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, COMMERCE AND INTERIOR. BUT THERE'S A BIG QUESTION ABOUT THE OTHER HALF OF THE GOVERNMENT THAT RUNS OUT OF MONEY NEXT FRIDAY. SO WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS THERE. >>. THANK YOU SO MUCH. >>>. LET'S GET TO THE LATEST. ON THE FORECAST, SEVERE STORM THREAT COULD, IMPACT MILLIONS TODAY AND TOMORROW ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST. LET'S CHECK THE MORNING NEWS NOW: >> ANGIE LASSMAN IS WITH US. >>. FINALLY, FRIDAY AND WE HAVE A LOT TO TALK ABOUT. WHEN IT COMES TO THE WEATHER, WE HAVE THUNDERSTORMS THAT HAVE ERUPTED ACROSS MUCH OF THE SOUTHERN PLAINS AND WE HAVE GOT FOLKS IN THE ACTION. HERE ALONG THE GULF COAST STRETCHES UP INTO THE GREAT LAKES, SNOW FALLING, AND THE FARTHER WEST. YOU LOOK HERE'S DEAL. WE ARE GOING TO SEE BATCH OF MOISTURE INTO PARTS OF THE GREAT LAKES THROUGH THE DAY TODAY AND STRONGER STORMS ACROSS PARTS OF THE SOUTHEAST AND THERE IS SEVERE RISING FROM EAST TEXAS INTO THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE. I WILL SHOW YOU THE IMPACTS. BUT THAT MOISTURE WORKS EAST AS WE GET THROUGH THE DAY TOMORROW. IT WORKS INTO PARTS OF THE MID ATLANTIC AND NORTHEAST GETS IN ON THIS AND WE COULD SEE SNOW FALLING ON THE BACKSIDE OF THE SYSTEM BY THE TIME WE GET INTO YOUR SUNDAY: A SOGGY FORECAST FOR FOLKS ACROSS THE NORTHEAST AND MID ATLANTIC AND PARTS THE SOUTHEAST. FOR SATURDAY, SUNDAY THOUGH, WE WILL PICK UP ON SOME OF THE SNOW, SOME OF THE LAKE-EFFECT SNOW ACROSS THAT REGION BUT TODAY, ALL EYES ON PARTS OF THE GULF COAST AND FROM TEXAS TO FLORIDA UNDER THE POTENTIAL TO SEE SOME OF THE STRONGER STORMS, EVEN SEVERE STORMS. THE BULL'S EYE, ALEXANDRIA JACKSON, LOOKS LIKE IT IS IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT THE POTENTIAL TO SEE LARGE HAIL AND THE CHANCE FOR STRONG WIND GUSTS, AND OF COURSE WE CAN'T RULE OUT THE STRONGER TORNADOES- ONE OR TWO POSSIBLY. AS WE GET INTO THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING HOURS, WE HAVE GOT FLOOD ALERTS UP IN PREPARATION FOR SOME OF THE HEAVY RAIN WORKING ACROSS THE AREA- 14 MILLION PEOPLE INCLUDED IN THIS ATLANTA, BIRMINGHAM, JACKSON, METRO AREAS THAT ARE UNDER THE FLOOD WATCHES RIGHT NOW AND POTENTIAL FOR FLASH FLOOD, SOMETHING THERE. RAINFALL AMOUNTS LASTING THROUGH TOMORROW MORNING SO OVERNIGHT. THE FLASH FLOODING RISK WILL BE THERE FOR THIS REGION WE ARE EXPECTING ANYWHERE, FROM WIDESPREAD AAMOUNTS AN INCH TO 2 AND UPWARDS OF ISOLATED UP TO 8 INCHES. YOU SEE MONTGOMERY IN THE BULL'S EYE, WHERE WE COULD SEE THE GREATEST AMOUNTS, TOTALING AND GUYS. SO SORRY TO BE THE BEARER OF BAD NEWS. DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME 2:00 AM ON SUNDAY. SPRING IS AROUND THE CORN AND WARMER TEMPERATURES BUT YOU WILL HAVE A LITTLE SHORTER WEEKEND. THAT'S HAPPENING HERE AS WE GO FROM SATURDAY INTO SUNDAY. >> I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT. >> A LITTLE LATER >> THAT'S THE POSITIVE. AFTER 7:00 PM: >> THERE YOU GO. >> SHORTER WEEKEND DAY >> THAT'S TRUE. >>> THANK YOU. >>> COMING UP THE FATHER OF A. WE WANT TO WELCOME YOU IN TO SHARE A MOMENT THAT BRIGHTENS YOUR DAY, EVERY DAY, DESERVES THE BEST START. >>>. WELCOME BACK AND ARMY INTELLIGENCE ALLERGENS HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH SELLING NATIONAL DEFENSE INFORMATION TO CHINA OFFICIALS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. FROM THE ARREST OF THE ARMY SURGEON YESTERDAY, HE HAD TOP-SECRET SECURITY CLEARANCE- CLEARANCE STARTING IN JUNE OF 2022, HE WAS CONSPIRING WITH THE CONTACT INTEND TO DISCLOSE HIGHLY CLASSIFIED INFORMATION RELATING TO NATIONAL DEFENSE. HE WILL MAKE HIS INITIAL APPEARANCE BEFORE A JUDGE TODAY. >>>. NEW DEVELOPS IN THE CRIMINAL TRIAL OF JAMES CRUMBLEY: HIS JAIL COMMUNICATIONS HAVE BEEN CUT OFF AFTER HE ALLEGEDLY MADE THREATENING STATEMENTS WHILE IN JAIL. THE TURN OF EVENTS TAKING PLACE AFTER THE FIRST DAY OF TESTIMONY IN HIS TRIAL. THE FATHER MICHIGAN SCHOOL SHOOTER, EVEN CRUMBLY, FACES FOUR COUNTS OF INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER. THE SPREE LEFT FOUR STUDENTS DEAD AND SEVERAL WOUNDED >>. HIS WIFE WAS FOUND GUILTY ON SEVERAL -- SEMINOLE -- SIMILAR CHARGES. OPENING STATEMENTS OPENED YESTERDAY. WHETHER THE SHOOTING RAMPAGE COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED. >>. JAMES CRUMBLEY BOUGHT THAT GUN HIS SON USED TO KILL AS HE DID FOUR DAYS FOR THE ATTACK >>. PAY ATTENTION, JAMES CRUMBLEY NEW THAT HIS SON KNEW WHERE THE GUN WAS. JAMES CRUMBLEY WAS NOT AWARE THAT HIS SON HAD ACCESS TO THAT FIREARM >>. NBC NEWS ANALYST JOINS US NOW BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT JAMIE -- JAMES CRUMBLEY TRIAL. WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE THREATS? >>. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE. THE DEFENSE ARGUED TO KEEP THEM OUT OF OPEN COURT. OUT OF OPEN COURT IT COULD TAKE. -- BE BAD FOR THE DEFENDANT. HE CAN STILL HAVE ACCESS TO HIS ATTORNEYS- ATTORNEYS FROM A PERSONAL NOTE. NOTHING MORE FRUSTRATING. WHEN YOU ARE ON TRIAL AND YOU TELL YOUR CLIENT, THE ONLY THING YOU HAVE TO DO IS SIT THERE AND LOOK, NOT GUILTY, AND THE CLIENT GETS HIMSELF INTO TROUBLE IN A CLASSIC WAY WHICH IS SAYING SOMETHING AT A MEETING OR ON THE PHONE, WHERE EVERYTHING IS RECORDED. THE GOVERNMENT WILL TAKE WHAT YOU SAY AND USE IT AGAINST YOU. EVEN IF JAMES CRUMBLEY DID NOT MAKE IT REAL, TRUE THREAT IN HIS MIND, HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE CAREFUL WHEN USING A PRISON PHONE OR SPEAKING AT PRISON OR OPENING EVER INCARCERATED >>. ANYTHING STAND OUT. YESTERDAY DOESN'T SEEM. THE PROSECUTION IS FOLLOWING THE SAME STRATEGY USED TO CONVICT JENNIFER CRUMBLEY >>. THE PROSECUTION MADE A GOOD ARGUMENT. I HEARD THE SAME CLOSING ARGUMENT EARLIER THIS WEEK IN THE REST TRIAL OF THE ARMOR. IT WAS ALMOST WORD FOR WORD. WE ARE NOT ALLEGING THAT DEFENDANT KNEW OR WANTED THE SHOOTING TO HAPPEN. IF THAT WAS THE CASE, HE WOULD BE TRIED FOR MURDER. HE'S BEING TRIED FOR INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER FOR BASICALLY CREATING A RISK. FOR BASICALLY CREATING A RISK, THIS KIND OF THING WOULD HAPPEN. I THOUGHT THE DEFENSE DID NOT HAVE A RESPONSE. THEY FOCUSED INSTEAD ON JAMES CRUMBLEY. HAD NO IDEA THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN BY THE WAY, JUST BECAUSE HE DIDN'T KNOW THIS WOULD HAPPEN THE WAY. IT DID DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN. HE WAS NOT NEGLIGENT. IF YOU ARE SCORING AT THE PROSECUTION CAME AHEAD ON THE FIRST DAY. >> JENNIFER CRUMBLEY'S TRIAL. SHE TOOK THE STAND. THAT'S NOT ALWAYS A GREAT IDEA. DO YOU THINK WE WILL SEE THAT HERE? >>. IT DEPENDS ON EACH CLIENT. JENNIFER CRUMBLEY DID NOT DO A GREAT JOB BUT THEN AGAIN, REALLY, MOST REGULAR FOLKS DO NOT TESTIFY IT'S TERRIFYING IN. THIS CASE IS A HIGH PROFILE CASE. IT'S DIFFICULT. IF JAMES CRUMBLEY IS A BETTER SPEAKER, YOU MAY SEE HIM TAKE THE STAND. IT'S A GAME. THEY DECISION. YOU PREPARE THE CLIENT UP UNTIL THE MOMENT OF AND LOOK BACK AND SAY: FORGET IT, IT'S TOO RISKY. >>. WILL THERE BE EVIDENCE FROM JENNIFER CRUMBLEY'S TRIAL AND RECEIPT NEW WITNESSES? >>. WE WILL SEE THE SAME EVIDENCE TEXT MESSAGES BETWEEN JENNIFER CRUMBLEY AND HER SON WERE EXCLUDED BECAUSE THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT JAMES CRUMBLEY NEW OF THOSE EXCHANGES. THERE WERE DAMNING EVIDENCE AGAINST HER. YOU WILL SEE JENNIFER CRUMBLEY OR THE SUN TAKE THE STAND FOR FIFTH AMENDMENT REASONS. FIFTH AMENDMENT REASONS. THEY WILL NOT BE WITNESSES ON THE WHOLE: A LOT OF THE SAME EVIDENCE, THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BEING THEY WILL FOCUS ON WHAT JAMES CRUMBLEY NEW, AS OPPOSED TO WHAT JENNIFER CRUMBLEY NEW. >>> TO INTERNATIONAL HEADLINES, STARTING WITH A HISTORIC MORNING IN FRANCE. >> MEAGAN FITZGERALD JOINS US THIS MORNING. >>. Reporter. GOOD MORNING. WE START IN FRANCE, WHERE THE COUNTRY CELEBRATING A HISTORIC DAY, THE FIRST COUNTRY TO SEAL IN THE NATION'S CONSTITUTION, THE NATION'S CONSTITUTION, THE RIGHT TO HAVE AN ABORTION. FRANCE IS MARKING THIS HISTORIC MOVE BY A MONEY THAT'S INCLUSIVE OF THE ENTIRE PUBLIC ACROSS THE COUNTRY. LEADERS CHOSE TODAY BECAUSE IT'S INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY, AND A MOVEMENT TO SHOW SUPPORT, NOT ONLY FOR THE WOMEN IN FRANCE, BUT WOMEN ACROSS THE WORLD. ABORTION IS LEGAL IN ALMOST ALL EUROPEAN COUNTRY, BUT IT'S CONTROVERSIAL IN THE UNITED STATES. A NEW NATIONAL SECURITY BILL WAS UNVEILED IN HONG KONG. THE PIECE OF LEGISLATION PROPOSES UP TO LIFE IN PRISON FOR TREASON AND INSURRECTIONS. THIS IS A CONCERNING MOVE FOR MANY ACROSS HONG KONG WHO FEAR THEIR CIVIL LIBERTIES AND FREEDOMS ARE BEING TAKEN AWAY AND THEY'RE MOVING MORE AND MORE LIKE CHINA. THIS COMES AFTER BEIJING. PUT A SIMILAR LAW IN PLACE. THAT WIPES OUT DISSENT. FINALLY, A COOL STORY OUT OF ARGENTINA, WHERE ARCHAEOLOGISTS HAVE DISCOVERED THE EARLIEST DATED CAVE PAINTINGS IN SOUTH AMERICA. THEY DATE BACK 8200 YEARS AND WERE FOUND MANY OF THEM IN THIS CAVE THAT WAS USED AS A SHELTER FOR HUNTERS AND GATHERERS. THE PAINTINGS WERE MADE WITH COAL COAL. THEY ARE STILL THERE MORE THAN 8200 YEARS LATER. THAT'S INCREDIBLE. >> THANK YOU. >>> A NEW REPORT ON THE SHOOTER WHO KILLED 18 PEOPLE IN MAINE, THE UNITED STATES. THEY TWEAKED MY MONITOR. YOU ARE IN FACT SOAKING WET. I'M DEEPLY SORRY. >>> WELCOME BACK. >>> WELCOME BACK. NEW DETAILS INVOLVING ROBERT CARD, THE MAN WHO KILLED 18 PEOPLE IN LEWISTON, MAINE, DURING THE MASS SHOOTING LAST YEAR. ACCORDING TO AN AUTOPSY ANALYSIS REQUESTED BY THE STATE'S CHIEF MEDICAL EXAMINER, CARD SHOWED EVIDENCE OF TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURIES THAT MAY HAVE PLAYED A ROLE IN HIS ACTIONS LEADING UP TO THE ATTACK. NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT HAS MORE. >>. Reporter. NEW ANALYSIS SHOWS BRAIN DAMAGE LIKELY CONTRIBUTED TO THE BEHAVIOR OF MAINE'S DEADLIEST MASS SHOOTER. ROBERT CARD IS SEEN IN THIS CHILLING POLICE BODY CAMERA FOOTAGE. >> THEY ARE SCARED. >>. Reporter. CAPTURED BEFORE THE ARMY RESERVIST OPEN FIRE, KILLING 18 PEOPLE AND WOUNDING A DOZEN AT A BOWLING ALLEY AND BAR IN LEWISTON, MAINE. POLICE WERE CALLED BY FELLOW ARMY RESERVIST, CONCERNED HE WAS ACTING ERRATICALLY. ACTING ERRATICALLY, ROBERT CARD TOOK HIS OWN LIFE. THE MEDICAL EXAMINER SENT TISSUE FROM HIS BRAIN TO BOSTON UNIVERSITY'S WORLD-RENOWNED CTE CENTER FOR ANALYSIS. THE RESEARCHER REVEALING CARD HAD EVIDENCE OF TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY. THE RESULTS ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE OF BLAST TRAUMA. THE CARD FAMILIES POINT HIS WORK AS A HINT GRENADE INSTRUCTOR. LEADING TO QUESTIONS INSTRUCTOR. LEADING TO QUESTIONS ABOUT A POSSIBLE LINK. WHAT CARD WAS NEVER DEPLOYED FOR ACTIVE DUTY. HIS FAMILY ALLEGES FOR YEARS HE WAS EXPOSED TO THOUSANDS OF LOW- LEVEL LAST DURING HIS TIME AS A REVERSE. THIS GRENADE TRAINER AT WEST POINT POINT THE LAB FINDINGS ARE CONCERNING ADDING THEY UNDERSCORED THE ARMY'S NEED TO DO ALL IT CAN TO PROTECT SOLDIERS AGAINST BLAST INDUCED INJURY >>. WE KNOW A LOT OF VETERANS ARE EXPOSED, AND HAVE BEEN EXPOSED, TO TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURIES IN BLAST. WE NEED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN HELP THEM. >>. Reporter. MULTIPLE US ARMY RESERVIST RAISED THE ALARM ABOUT CARD THE SUMMER BEFORE THE SHOOTING. >> WE NOTICED CARD WAS EXHIBITING STRANGE BEHAVIOR AND NOTIFIED OUR COMMAND. >>. Reporter. ONE TESTIFIED CARD WAS ADMITTED TO A MENTAL HEALTH HOSPITAL AND AFTER THAT NEVER RETURN TO WEST POINT. IT'S UPDATING THE GUIDANCE ON BLAST RELATED INJURIES AND PLANS TO LAUNCH A SAFETY CAMPAIGN IN THE NEAR FUTURE. >> THANK YOU. >> THANK YOU >>>. THE CODIRECTOR OF THE NYU CONCUSSION CENTER JOINS US NOW. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. WE HEARD THE FAMILY SAY HE WAS EXPOSED TO THOUSANDS OF LOW LEVEL BLASTS. WHAT KIND OF DAMAGE CAN THOSE BLASTS DUE TO THE BRAIN? HOW SERIOUS ARE THESE INJURIES? >> IT'S BLAST OVERPRESSURE, THE RISE IN THE ATMOSPHERE PRESSURE THAT HAPPENS WHEN A BLAST GOES OFF THE COMPRESSION OF AIR FORMS. A BLAST WAVE THAT ACCELERATES THE MOVEMENT OF AIR MOLECULES. OVER TIME, THIS CAN CAUSE LOW- LEVEL DAMAGE. IN THE REPORT IT SAID THE AXONS WERE DEGENERATED. THOSE ARE THE INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY OF EIGHT NEURON, WHICH, OVER TIME, CAN GET DAMAGED. WHICH OVER TIME CAN GET DAMAGED? OR, IN GENERAL, THE BRAIN IS SENSITIVE. >>. WHAT KIND OF SYMPTOMS SURFACE WHEN SOMEONE IS SUFFERING FROM A DRAMATIC BRAIN INJURY, ESPECIALLY IN A CASE LIKE THIS? IT'S NOT LIKE. IT WAS ONE EVENT OR ONE INJURY. THAT MAKES IT CLEAR. SOMETHING COULD BE WRONG WHEN IT HAPPENS OVER TIME. HOW DO YOU DIAGNOSE THAT? WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS TO WATCH FOR? >> THAT'S THE MOST INTERESTING QUESTION WE GET. EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT. I LIKE TO SAY TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY. PATIENTS ARE LIKE FINGERPRINTS, THEY ARE VERY DIFFERENT. THE FIRST THING IS FATIGUE AND HEADACHES ALSO MOOD CHANGES, ANXIETY, MEMORY ISSUES IS A BIG ONE WITH LONG-TERM, REPEATED EXPOSURE. IT'S MOOD ISSUES AND DISORIENTATION. >>. IF YOU SUSPECT SOMEONE MAY BE SUFFERING FROM SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND HAS A DRAMATIC BRAIN INJURY OR EXPOSURE THAT COULD HAVE CAUSE, THAT IS THERE A WAY TO TREAT IT. WHAT'S THE BEST THING TO DO. THE ALARMS HAPPENED. IF YOU NOTICE THIS, WHAT SHOULD YOU DO? >>. THE FIRST THING IS TO REMOVE THE PERSON FROM THE CAUSE OF THE INJURY. IN THIS INSTANCE THE DAMAGE MAY HAVE ALREADY BEEN DONE. HE RETIRED FROM SERVICE AT THE FIRST SIGN. YOU REMOVE THEM FROM WHATEVER IS CAUSING THE INJURY. YOU SUPPORT THEM THE BEST YOU CAN. THE TREATMENT SHOULD BE WELL MANAGED, ALSO PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PSYCHIATRIC ASPECTS. THERE'S MEDICATIONS AND SUPPLEMENTS. WE CAN DO BRAIN REST, TARGETED REHAB, TARGETED REHAB- ALL OF THAT DOES HELP, SORT OF BUT. I WON'T SAY REVERSE THE INJURY, BUT IT CAN HELP MANAGE AND QUAIL THE LONG-TERM DAMAGE. >>. THANK YOU, VERY INTERESTING AND IMPORTANT CONVERSATION. >>>. COMING UP, WARMER DAYS ARE AROUND THE CORNER. IF IT'S SUNDAY, IT'S ""MEET THE PRESS"" >>>. WELCOME BACK. YOU HAVE BIG SUMMER VACATION PLANS. I HOPE YOU DO. THE LITIGANT BUDGET BATTLE ON CAPITOL HILL COULD IMPACT. THOSE CONGRESS WILL REAUTHORIZE FUNDING FOR THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION. THAT WOULD HELP ADDRESS THE ONGOING AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER, SHORTAGE AND INCREASED STAFF LEVELS BUT IT HAS BEEN DIFFICULT TO GET DONE. LET'S BRING THE DEPUTY GLOBAL EDITORIAL DIRECTOR. GOOD MORNING, LOVE TRAVELER. ONE OF THE MOST FUN THINGS TO DO IS LOOK AT THE GORGEOUS PICTURES AND READ ABOUT EVERYTHING YOU WRITE ABOUT. LET'S JUMP INTO HOW IMPORTANT THIS FUNDING IS FOR THE FAA. IF THE CURRENT EXTENSION EXPIRES, WHAT IMPACT DOES THAT HAVE ON TRAVELERS? >>. IT'S GREAT TO BE WITH YOU. ANOTHER EXTENSION AND THERE'S A THIRD ONE THAT WILL EXPIRE ON MAY 10th. IT KICKS THE CAN, DOWN THE ROAD. IT DOES ALLOW THE FAA TO KEEP THE LIGHTS ON AND MAKE PAYROLL. IT DOES NOT ADDRESS WHAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT. THE ISSUE WITH THE AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND OTHER ISSUES THAT HAVE LED TO THE BOEING 737 MAX 9 PANEL BLOWOUT IN JANUARY THE CONCERNED A LOT OF TRAVELERS >>. WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THOSE SCARY POTENTIAL CLASHES, WIND CLIPPING ON RUNWAYS. HOW WOULD THIS PROPOSED FUNDING HELP THE FAA WITH THOSE BIG SAFETY ISSUES? PEOPLE THINK I HOPE I'M NOT ON A PLANE THAT THIS HAPPENS TO >>. THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE IS STAFFING SHORTAGE. YOU HAVING A PEOPLE AND KEEP TRAVELERS SAY THE HOUSE PASSED A BILL. THAT HAS LANGUAGE IN THE SENATE. THE BIGGEST PIECE OF FUNDING IT CONTAINS IS THE SAFETY REFORMS, WHICH INCLUDE MODERNIZING AIRPORT TECHNOLOGY AND ALSO ADDING NEW SAFETY PROCEDURES TO ESTABLISH NEW PLAINS. THAT IS HOPEFULLY PREVENTING INCIDENTS. THAT HAPPENS IN JANUARY. ALL THESE THINGS WOULD DO A LOT. ALL THESE THINGS WOULD DO A LOT TO ENSURE TRAVELER SAFETY AND COMFORT AND HAPPINESS AND AVOID THE FREQUENT DELAYS WE'VE SEEN, ESPECIALLY DURING SUMMER TRAVEL SEASON. >> WHAT IS THE STATUS ON THE SHORTAGE OF AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS? DO YOU EXPECT THAT IT WILL STILL BE AN ISSUE? >>. YES, THE STATE OF THE AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS IS NOT STRONG. THE WORKFORCE IS ABOUT 10 % SMALLER THAN IT WAS 10 YEARS AGO. THAT'S DESPITE INCREASED DEMAND FOR AIR TRAVEL. THE FAA PREDICTS THE CURRENT WORKFORCE WILL SHRINK BY 10 % BY THE COURSE OF THIS YEAR. THEY DON'T HAVE GREAT WORKING CONDITIONS. REPORTS OF LACK OF AIR CONDITIONING, NO LIGHTBULBS. ALSO AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL IS WORKING THROUGH INSECT ATTACKS. THERE'S MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES THAT COME FROM AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS WORKING SIX DAYS A WEEK, 10 HOURS A DAY. IT'S A HARD, STRESSFUL AND IMPORTANT JOB AND WE NEED TO TREATED WITH THE RESPECT IT DESERVES. ALL OF THESE ISSUES CONTRIBUTE TO SAFETY, BUT ALSO THE POTENTIAL FOR DISRUPTION. FEWER AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS MEANS FEWER SLOTS AT AIRPORTS FOR PLAINS TO TAKE OFF AND LAND. THAT MEANS FEWER SEATS. IT'S A CAPACITY ISSUE. IT'S A CAPACITY ISSUE. >> AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION. THANK YOU. >>>. LET'S GET YOU FINANCIAL HEADLINES. CHANGES ARE COMING TO BOEING AFTER CHAOTIC START TO THE YEAR. HERE'S OUR MONEY NEWS >>. Reporter: GOOD MORNING. BOEING IS OVERHAULING HOW IT. BOEING IS OVERHAULING HOW IT PAYS EMPLOYEE BONUSES, PUTTING AN EMPHASIS ON QUALITY AND SAFETY. THE COMPANY HAS SCRAMBLED TO BOOST SAFETY PROCEDURES, FOLLOWING THE BLOWOUT OF THE DOOR PANEL ON EIGHT NEW ALASKA AIRLINES 737 MAX 9 JET SAFETY AND QUALITY METRICS WILL ACCOUNT FOR 60 % OF THE PAYOUT. PREVIOUS INCENTIVES MADE 75 % OF ANNUAL BONUSES. THE HOUSE WILL VOTE ON A BILL CRACKING DOWN ON TIKTOK. THE ENERGY AND COMMERCE COMMITTEE VOTING UNANIMOUSLY YESTERDAY ON THE MEASURE IT WOULD GIVE TIKTOK'S CHINESE PARENT COMPANY SIX MONTHS TO SELL THE POPULAR APP OR FACE THE US. TIKTOK IS NOT SHARED USER DATA WITH THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT. THEY SAY IT'S NOT CLEAR WHETHER CHINA WOULD APPROVE THE SALE INSTAGRAM TOP TIKTOK IN NEW DOWNLOADS. LAST YEAR MARKET RESEARCH SAYS INSTAGRAM'S DOWNLOADS ROSE 20 % WORLDWIDE, WHILE TIKTOK EDGED UP JUST 4 %. THAT SUGGESTS THAT INSTAGRAM IS HAVING SUCCESS IN TARGETING NEW USERS BY ROLLING OUT COPYCAT FEATURES OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, INCLUDING REELS. TIKTOK HAS BETTER ENGAGEMENT FROM ITS 1 BILLION USERS, THE SPENDING 95 MINUTES ON THE APP VERSUS 62 MINUTES FOR INSTAGRAM. I DON'T HAVE TIKTOK >>. I DON'T EITHER. >> I DON'T THINK I NEEDED. >>>. MARCH IS WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH. WE ARE TAKING A LOOK AT THE STRIDES WOMEN ARE MAKING IN THE HOUSING MARKET. NEW DATA FOUND SINGLE WOMEN ON MORE HOMES THAN SINGLE MEN. IN THAT SAME POSITION, LET'S BRING IN THE SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF HOME OWNERSHIP SOLUTIONS AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROGRAMS AT BANK OF AMERICA. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. WHY DO YOU THINK IT IS? WE'RE SEEING SINGLE WOMEN ENTER THE HOUSING MARKET. WHAT'S BEHIND THE TREND? >>. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. HAPPY INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY. IT'S A GREAT TIME TO BE A WOMAN. I OFTEN TALK TO YOUNGER WOMEN- MILLENNIALS, GEN Z AND IT BLOWS THEIR MIND WHEN I TELL THEM 50 YEARS AGO, THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GET A MORTGAGE WITHOUT A MAN SIGNING ON THE DOTTED LINE WITH THEM. THE EVOLUTION OF REGULATORY TO PROTECT WOMEN HAVE BEEN INSTRUMENTAL. WE HAVE GONE FROM 19 SORRY 1981, WHERE THERE WERE 11 % OF THE HOMEOWNERSHIP WAS WOMEN AND 10 % SINGLE MEN. NOW, IN 2023, THAT HAS JUMPED UP TO 19 % FOR WOMEN AND IT REMAINS A FLAT 10 % FOR MEN. I THINK IT'S TWOFOLD. THERE ARE A LOT OF WOMEN OUT THERE AND SEE THIS AS FINANCIAL SUCCESS: OWNING THEIR OWN HOME. THEY ARE WILLING TO DO WHATEVER IS NECESSARY, WHETHER IT'S MAKING SACRIFICES, WHETHER GETTING THE INFORMATION THAT IS GOING TO BE A SUCCESSFUL OWNER. THEY ARE DOING THE WORK, UNDERSTANDING WHAT THEY CAN AFFORD AND WHAT PROBLEMS --. PROGRAMS ARE AVAILABLE TO YOU >> BLOWS MY MIND ABOUT THE MAN BEING THE MORTGAGE WITH YOU. TELL US THE CHALLENGES FOR WOMEN TRYING TO ENTER THE HOUSING MARKET >>. A LOT OF IT IS MYTHS WITHIN THE MARKET. A LOT OF PEOPLE FEEL YOU NEED 20 % DOWN, YOU NEED TO HAVE PERFECT CREDIT AND YOU CANNOT HAVE STUDENT LOAN DEBT. NONE OF THAT IS TRUE. WE'VE GOT PRODUCTS THAT ARE AVAILABLE, THAT REQUIRE AS LITTLE AS 3 % DOWN. MORE IMPORTANTLY, WE'VE GOT PROGRAMS TO HELP YOU. WE'VE GOT TWO GRANT PROGRAMS. ONE IS UP TO $7500 IN CLOSING COSTS- GRANTS THAT CAN ALSO BE USED TO BUY DOWN YOUR INTEREST RATE IN ADDITION TO THAT IN 98 OF OUR MARKETS WE'VE GOT 3 % OR $10,000. WE WILL HELP YOU WITH THE DOWN PAYMENT. WE HAVE GRANT PROGRAMS THAT CAN HELP THOSE FIRST-TIME HOMEBUYERS MAKE THIS A REALITY, AND WE CAN USE THOSE WITH LOCALLY AVAILABLE DOWN PAYMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS TO MAKE AN AFFORDABLE MORTGAGE FOR YOU. >>. FOR A YOUNG, SINGLE WOMAN WHOSE WATCHING THIS AND THINKS- I HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT WANTING TO OWN A HOME AND IT IS A DREAM OF MINE. WHAT WOULD YOU TELL HER RIGHT NOW WHAT IS THE FIRST STEP SHE SHOULD TAKE? >>. I LOVE YOU. ASK ME THAT. ONE OF MY FAVORITE PARTS OF MY JOB IS WORKING WITH COUNSELORS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THEY CAN SIT DOWN WITH BORROWERS AND HELP THEM FIGURE OUT THEIR FINANCES AND HELP THEM GET QUALIFIED. BEFORE THEY GO OUT SHOPPING FOR A HOME, THEY WILL KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IS A COMFORTABLE MORTGAGE PAYMENT FOR THEM. THEY WILL ALSO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH THEM ON AVAILABLE DOWN PAYMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS TO SEE WHAT THEY MAY QUALIFY FOR. ONE OF THE MORE FUN PARTS OF MY JOB IS I DO CONSUMER OUTREACH. IN MY CONSUMER OUTREACH IT IS SURPRISING TO ME OVERWHELMINGLY WOMEN THAT ATTEND THESE WORKSHOPS. THE REASON WHY IS THEY KNOW THEY WOULD BE PREPARED. WOMEN ARE VERY FOCUSED ON TAKING SURE. THEY ARE TAKING SURE. THEY ARE FINANCIALLY PREPARED FOR THE OBLIGATION OF HOMEOWNERSHIP. THEY DO A GREAT JOB OF DOING THE RESEARCH. I WOULD SAY THE OTHER THING IS: BUILD YOUR TEAM OF TRUSTWORTHY PEOPLE. YOU CAN GET THIS WORD-OF-MOUTH. WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS: FIND A LENDER THAT IS TRUSTWORTHY. FIND A REAL ESTATE AGENT THAT IS A BUYERS AGENT AND REPRESENT YOUR INTEREST, AND MAKE SURE THEY ARE LOOKING OUT FOR YOUR FINANCIAL FUTURE. AND BUILD THIS TEAM AND GO OUT THERE AND FIND THE HOME OF YOUR DREAMS. >>. GREAT ADVICE, WE APPRECIATE YOU COMING ON HAPPY INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY. >> THANK, YOU, HAVE A GREAT DAY. >>> COMING UP A GROUP OF WOMEN >>> WELCOME BACK. >>> WELCOME BACK.

EVERY TIME I THINK ABOUT IT, I PICTURE MY TEAMMATES WHEN THE GOAL HAPPENED. IT WAS FOR ALL OF THEM. IT MAY HAVE MY NAME ON IT, BUT IT WAS THE ENTIRE LEAGUE. FOR CO, THE 32-YEAR-OLD FORWARD MADISON PACKER AND THE GOALIE, HOCKEY HAS BEEN A LIFELONG PASSION. >>. MY PARENTS MET AT ISLANDERS GAME. WE HAD SEASON TICKETS.

WHY DID YOU CHOOSE TO LAUNCH THAT WAY IN A DAY AND AGE THAT BRANDING IS SO CRITICAL TO SUCCESS? >>. SOCCER IS THE BIGGEST SPORT.

ONE MAN WHO HECKLED PRESIDENT BIDEN LAST NIGHT WAS A GOLD STAR FATHER WHOSE SON WAS AMONG THE 13 US SERVICE MEMBERS KILLED DURING THE CHAOTIC WITHDRAWAL FROM AFGHANISTAN IN 2021.. THE FATHER WAS ARRESTED FOR HIS OUTBURST IS FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN'S PERFORMANCE. IT WENT A LONG WAY TO EASE DEMOCRATS CONCERNS ABOUT HIS AGE. DURING HIS 33 MINUTE WALK OUT OF THE CHAMBER, A SENIOR DEMOCRAT SAID TO THE PRESIDENT: NO ONE WILL CALL YOU COGNITIVELY IMPAIRED NOW. >>. ONE OF THE KEY ISSUES IN THIS YEAR WILL BE THE FIGHT OVER REPRODUCTIVE LIGHTS, IN VITRO FERTILIZATION AND ABORTION ACCESS. WE ARE JOINED BY SOMEONE WITH A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE WHO ALSO WAS AT THE STATE OF THE UNION LAST NIGHT- ELIZABETH CARR, THE FIRST US BABY BROTHER, IVF. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE WITH US DEMOCRATS PUT THESE REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS. INVITING GUESTS LIKE YOURSELF, WHO WERE IMPACTED BY THE SUPREME COURT'S REVERSAL OF ROE V WADE OR THE ALABAMA COURT DECISION ON IVF. YOU WERE A GUEST OF REGINA SENATOR TIM KAINE. WHAT WAS YOUR EXPERIENCE? LIKE BEING INSIDE THE HOUSE CHAMBER FOR THE STATE OF THE UNION >>. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. IT WAS INCREDIBLE TO BE THERE. I HAD A HARD TIME GOING TO SLEEP AFTER THE SPEECH BECAUSE I WAS SO EXCITED TO HEAR THAT ID NUMBER 2 WAS REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS IN THIS COUNTRY THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN ESSENTIALLY OPENED HIS SPEECH WITH MANY OF US ADVOCATES IN THE. MANY OF US ADVOCATES IN THE AUDIENCE WERE VERY PLEASED TO HEAR THAT AND IT WAS AN EXPERIENCE I WILL NOT SOON FORGET. >>. LET'S TALK ABOUT SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED. EARLIER ALABAMA PASSED A LAW THAT ENABLES FERTILITY CLINICS TO RESUME IVF WITHOUT BEING HELD QUOTE FOR THE DAMAGE OR DEATH TO AN EMBRYO. WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS NEW LAW >>. YOU KNOW, I THINK THE NEW LAW THAT ALABAMA PUT IN PLACE GIVING IMMUNITY IS A GOOD START, BUT IT DOESN'T GET AT THE CENTRAL ISSUE OF THESE FROZEN EMBRYOS, THE QUESTION OF WHERE LIFE BEGINS. THERE'S A LOT MORE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND IT DOESN'T NEEDS TO BE DONE AND IT DOESN'T GO QUITE FAR ENOUGH. BUT I AM GRATEFUL THAT PEOPLE WHO NEED THEIR TREATMENT CAN AT LEAST GET BACK IN THE DOORS OF THEIR FERTILITY CLINICS THAT HAD CLOSED AFTER THE ALABAMA RULING CAME DOWN. >>. IVF ACCOUNTS -- 2% OF US BIRTHS AND ESTIMATED 12 MILLION PEOPLE WORLDWIDE WHO ARE HERE BECAUSE OF IN VITRO FERTILIZATION. LIKE YOURSELF, IF WE ALIGN WHAT HAPPENED IN ALABAMA AS AN ADVOCATE AND YOU ARE HERE BECAUSE OF IVF, WHAT WAS GOING THROUGH YOUR MIND AS YOU WATCH THIS PLAY OUT IN ALABAMA? AND WHEN YOU FIRST HEARD THAT INITIAL RULING >>. WHEN I FIRST HEARD THE RULING, IT WAS DEVASTATING. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE COUNT ON WHEN BUILDING THE FAMILIES. THEY HAVE FEW OPTIONS. IF YOU GET A DIAGNOSIS OF INFERTILITY, ARE GOING THROUGH CANCER TREATMENTS. MANY PEOPLE USE THIS TECHNOLOGY TO BUILD THEIR FAMILY. TO HAVE THAT ABILITY ESSENTIALLY TAKEN AWAY WITH SOMETHING THAT I FELT WAS A PERSONAL ATTACK ON FOLKS LIKE ME. I WAS HEARTBROKEN FOR EVERYBODY. >>. ELIZABETH CARR, THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR EXPERIENCE AND THANK YOU FOR DISCUSSING THIS WITH US. THE FIRST US BABY BORN THROUGH IVF. >>>. THERE IS GROWING OUTRAGE. AFTER, AN INVESTIGATION PAID FOR BY THE UVALDE CITY COUNCIL EXONERATED SEVERAL POLICE OFFICERS OF WRONGDOING IN THE RESPONSE TO THE SHOOTING AT. RESPONSE TO THE SHOOTING AT ROBB ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN 2022.. ON THAT DAY, 19 CHILDREN AND TWO TEACHERS WERE KILLED. WHEN THE GUNMAN ENTERED THE SCHOOL AND OPENED FIRE. >>. THE INVESTIGATION WAS MADE BY AN AUSTIN INVESTIGATOR. ALTHOUGH HE ACKNOWLEDGED, THERE WERE COMMUNICATION ISSUES. HE DEFENDED THE ACTIONS OF LOCAL POLICE. HE DELIVERED HIS FINDINGS THE FRONT OF THE VICTIMS' FAMILIES, PROMPTING A WALKOUT FROM SOME AFTER MAKING THESE COMMENTS. ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO RUSHED TO THE SCENE THAT DAY >> THE CROWD AT TIMES THEY WERE DIFFICULT TO CONTROL. THEY WERE WANTING TO BREAK THROUGH POLICE BARRIERS. THERE WERE TIMES WHEN SOME OF THE PEOPLE IN THE CROWN- NOT ALL OF THEM BUT SOME OF THEM- WANTED TO -- SOME OF THEM WANTED TO- GET TO AN AMBULANCE EVEN. THAT WAS THERE. >>. WITH EMOTIONS RUNNING HIGH, WHEN HE WAS FINISHED WITH HIS PRESENTATION, HE WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM, PROVOKING ANGER FROM THE VICTIMS' FAMILIES, WHO SHOUTED FOR HIM TO COME BACK. >>. I AM ASKING YOU TO DO WHAT NO ONE ELSE HAS DONE. YET DO THE RIGHT THING. IT'S NOT A BETTER RECOMMENDATION BUT DOING THE RIGHT THING. THERE WERE MULTIPLE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS FROM MULTIPLE AGENCIES THAT STOOD BY FOR 77 MINUTES AS CHILDREN AND TEACHERS START. >>. MY DAUGHTER WAS LEFT FOR DEAD. LEFT FOR DEAD, YOU SAID THEY DID THE RIGHT THING. THESE POLICE OFFICERS SIGNED UP TO DO A JOB. THEY DIDN'T DO IT >>. JOINING US IS LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST AND RETIRED ATF SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE. JIM CAVANAUGH, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN TOLD THE LESSON FROM COLUMBINE IS POLICE OFFICERS, DO NOT WAIT. THEY CHARGE IN. WHAT IS YOUR REACTION TO THIS REPORT THAT WAS COMMISSIONED BY THE UVALDE CITY COUNCIL >>. IT IS SAD. I READ IT. IT IS VERY SAD. IT'S VERY BUREAUCRATIC. IT TRIES TO RELIEVE THE OFFICERS OF ANY RESPONSIBILITY TO WATCH THE INVESTIGATORS. SAY TO THESE FAMILIES THAT TRYING TO DESCRIBE THE CROWD OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL, GOING TOWARD AN AMBULANCE, WHY IS THAT AN ISSUE FOR THE INVESTIGATOR AT ALL? THIS IS FAMILIES, PARENTS BEING HUMAN. THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS IN TRAGIC HUMAN EVENTS: 19 CHILDREN MASSACRE AND TWO HERO TEACHERS AND 16 OTHERS WOUNDED OF COURSE. PEOPLE WILL REACT LIKE THAT TO CRITICIZE THAT IS WRONG. THE REPORT SHOULD BE DISREGARDED BY THE PARENTS. IT'S MEANINGLESS. IT'S TOTALLY BUREAUCRATIC. HE DOES INTERVIEW ALL THE OFFICERS. THEN HE COMES OUT AND SAYS THEY DISPLAYED IMMEASURABLE STRENGTH. THAT'S NOT THE CASE. THE CASE, AS WE DISCUSSED ON YOUR AIR MANY TIMES IN THE PAST, IT WAS A LACK OF COURAGE IN THE FACE OF DANGER. THAT IS WHAT POLICE SIGN UP FOR. WHEN THEY PIN ON THE BADGE AND TAKE THE TRAINING, HE IS TALKING ABOUT POLICIES AND THESE LITTLE THINGS. THAT DON'T MATTER. LACK OF COURAGE IN THE FACE OF DANGER. THEY SHOULD'VE WHEN IN. THEY WAITED 77 MINUTES. EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED HERE. THAT REPORT WILL NOT CHANGE ANYTHING >>. THIS IS THE ONLY REPORT INTO THE SHOOTING WE DISCUSSED WITH YOU. TWO MONTHS AGO, THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT RELEASED ITS OWN INVESTIGATION. THAT WAS HIGHLY CRITICAL OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. I GUESS WHY PUT THE FAMILIES THROUGH THIS? WHY DID THE CITY COUNCIL PAY FOR THEIR OWN REPORT? AN END TO THAT. AFTER HE HAD THEM COMING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THEY'RE SO DIFFERENT, SUCH DIFFERENT CONCLUSIONS? >>. IT WAS A BAD DECISION BY THE CITY COUNCIL TO DO THAT. I AM PROUD TO SAY I SPENT MOST OF MY LIFE AS PART OF FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND IN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND ATF- DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND ATF AND THE REPORT IS ACCURATE. IT'S A GREAT REPORT AND VERY CRITICAL. IT IS ACCURATE AND TALKS ABOUT THE LACK OF LEADERSHIP, THE LACK OF TACTICAL DECISION- MAKING, LACK OF COURAGE IN THE FACE OF DANGER. THE CONTRAST TO THIS IS THE SHOOTING WE HAD IN NASHVILLE AT THE COVENANT SCHOOL. OFFICERS ARRIVED, SHOOTER WITH AN AR-15s, LIKE UVALDE SHOOTING AT THE METROPOLITAN POLICE, AND 3 TO 5 OF THEM ENTERED THE SCHOOL. THEY DON'T WAIT. THAT'S THE CONTRAST. NOW, THIS LACK OF COURAGE IN THE FACE OF DANGER IS RIPPING THE COMMUNITY APART. THE PARENTS SHOULD DISREGARD THE REPORT. THE DOJ REPORT SPEAKS THE TRUTH. WE WILL HAVE TO SEE WHAT THE DA DOES WITH THE GRAND JURY >>. WE APPRECIATE YOUR ANALYSIS. >>>. TURNING TO MICHIGAN, WHERE THE FATHER OF SCHOOL SHOOTER, ETHAN CRUMBLEY, IS ON TRIAL. WE ARE LEARNING FROM OFFICIALS THAT JAMES CRUMBLEY'S COMMUNICATION PRIVILEGES HAVE. COMMUNICATION PRIVILEGES HAVE BEEN RESTRICTED. AFTER MAKING THREATS FROM JAIL. THE SHOCKING DEVELOPMENT: AFTER THE FIRST AND TESTIMONY IN HIS INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER TRIAL, MAGGIE VESPA JOINS US FROM PONTIAC, MICHIGAN WITH THE LATEST >> Reporter. SHOCKING DEVELOPMENT IS RIGHT, THE LOCAL SHERIFF'S OFFICE NOT TELLING US WHO THE THREATS WERE ALLEGEDLY AGAINST HER EVENT, WHEN THEY ALLEGEDLY HAPPEN JUST TELLING US THAT JAMES CRUMBLEY CAN ONLY COMMUNICATE FROM JAIL WITH HIS ATTORNEY AT THE SAME TIME, THE FATHER NOW FACING THE SAME CHARGES, NOW FACING THE SAME CHARGES- THAT A JURY LAST MONTH CONVICTED HIS WIFE OF SETTING A NEW PRECEDENT FOR HOW WE PROSECUTE MASS SHOOTINGS IN AMERICA. THIS MORNING JAW-DROPPING TWIST IN THE TRIAL OF A MICHIGAN FATHER CHARGED AND HIS SON'S SCHOOL SHOOTING AFTER. OFFICIALS SAY JAMES CRUMBLEY MADE THREATS FROM INSIDE JAIL. THE OAKLAND COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE OVERNIGHT TELLING NBC NEWS THAT HAS ACCESS TO A TELEPHONE AND ELECTRONIC MESSAGING WHILE IN JAIL HAVE BEEN LIMITED DUE TO THREATENING STATEMENTS. HE MADE WHILE ON THE PHONE AND IN ELECTRONIC MESSAGES ADDING HE IS LIMITED TO COMMUNICATION WITH HIS LAWYER. NBC NEWS REACHED OUT TO HIS ATTORNEY WHO, LIKE THE PROSECUTION, IS UNDER A GAG ORDER. SO FAR, NO RESPONSE. >>. HE WAS THE ADULT AND IN THE POSITION TO PREVENT THESE KIDS DEATH >>. Reporter ORDER CAMPING DAY ONE IN THE INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER TRIAL, WITH PROSECUTORS ARGUING BACK IN 2021, CRUMBLEY IGNORED WARNING SIGNS THAT HIS SON WAS STRUGGLING WITH HIS MENTAL HEALTH AND FAILED TO SECURE THE GUN ETHAN USED TO KILL FOUR CLASSMATES AT OXFORD HIGH SCHOOL. THE 47-YEAR-OLD, USING HEADPHONES AS HEARING AIDS, LISTENED AS PROSECUTORS PLAYED HIS FRANTIC 911 CALL FROM THAT DAY: >> WE FIND THE DEFENDANT. >> WE FIND THE DEFENDANT GUILTY. >>. Reporter. THIS ONE MONTH AFTER A JURY, IN THE SAME COURTROOM, WITH THE SAME JUDGE, FOUND HIS WIFE GUILTY OF THE SAME CHARGES. THIS AFTER, SHE TESTIFIED THAT JAMES WAS IN CHARGE OF SECURING THE GUN. >>. I DIDN'T FEEL COMFORTABLE BEING IN CHARGE OF THAT. IT WAS MORE HIS THING. >>. Reporter: CRUMBLEY'S ATTORNEY PUSHING BACK. >>. JAMES CRUMBLEY DID NOT KNOW WHAT HIS SON WAS GOING TO DO. >>. Reporter: A NEW JURY HEARING FROM THEM MANY SAME WITNESSES, INCLUDING THE TEACHER. >>. I STARTED FEELING BLOOD ROLLING DOWN MY ARM. >>. Reporter: ONE QUESTION IS: WHETHER OR NOT JAMES CRUMBLEY WILL FOLLOW HIS WIFE'S LEAD AND TAKE THE STAND IN HIS OWN DEFENSE. HIS ATTORNEY HAS YET TO SAY OR INDICATE EITHER WAY BACK TO THE ALLEGED THREATS. THE LOCAL SHERIFF HAS NOT SAID WHO JAMES IS ACCUSED OF THREATENING, BUT IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT OFFICIALS TOLD US THE ENTIRE TIME HE HAS BEEN BEHIND BARS. HE HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO DIRECTLY CONTACT HIS WIFE OR HIS SON FROM JAIL. OFFICIALS HAVE SAID THE THREE HAVE BEEN HELD SEPARATELY. WE ARE WORKING TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THIS COURT HERE RESUMES. AT 9:00 AM, HEAVY RAIN SET TO COVER THE SOUTHEAST AND THAT'S PUTTING MILLIONS ON FLOOD. WATCH ON WHAT TO EXPECT FOR THE WEEKEND. LET'S CHECK THE FORECAST >> WITH ANGIE LASSMAN. >>>. HAPPY FRIDAY. UNFORTUNATELY, WEEKEND PLANS MAY BE INTERRUPTED BY THE STORM SYSTEM WORKING ACROSS THE EASTERN HALF OF THE COUNTRY. WE HAVE RAIN, RUMBLES OF THUNDER YOU ARE HEARING- AND DALLAS WET ROADS FROM PARTS OF THE SOUTHEAST INTO THE MIDWEST AS WE WATCH THE SYSTEM WORK FURTHER TO THE EAST. THAT WILL HAPPEN THE NEXT DAY AND WITH THAT COMES THE POTENTIAL FOR STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS. WE HAVE HEAVY RAIN. FLOODING RAIN WILL BE SOMETHING WE DEAL WITH IN THE SOUTHWEST TODAY, AS WELL AS THE GREAT LAKES. THE SEVERE RISK WILL BE SOMETHING WE SEE TODAY AND TOMORROW. TOMORROW, WITH THE RAIN CHANCES THEY RAMP UP ACROSS THE MID- ATLANTIC NORTHEAST. IT WILL EVEN GET THE POTENTIAL TO SEE LAKE EFFECT SNOW AS WE WRAP UP THE WEEKEND AND HEAD INTO SUNDAY AS THE SYSTEM STARTS TO EXIT. LET'S LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON WITH SEVERE WEATHER TODAY. TEXAS ALL THE WAY TO THE PANHANDLE COULD SEE THOSE DEVELOPING. HAIL WILL BE THE BIGGEST THREAT, BUT WE CANNOT RULE OUT STRONG WINDS AND THE POTENTIAL FOR ISOLATED TORNADOES AND FLASH FLOODING LIKELY TO OCCUR ACROSS PARTS OF THE SOUTHEAST. WE HAVE FLOOD WATCHES FOR 14 MILLION PEOPLE FROM JACKSON AND ATLANTA IS INCLUDED AS WELL AS MONTGOMERY. THIS IS THE BULL'S-EYE WHERE WE COULD SEE FLASH FLOODING AND LIKELY OVERNIGHT EARLY MORTY SATURDAY PLANS- MOBILE ALEXANDRIA. THEY HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO SEE SIGNIFICANT FLASH FLOODING AS WE GET INTO SATURDAY. ISOLATED AMOUNTS OF DEBT 8 INCHES, MORE LIKELY 1 TO 2 INCHES THERE'S NOWHERE FOR THE WATER TO GO, SO FLOODING COULD OCCUR. THE MIDDLE OF THE COUNTRY LOOKS GREAT. ANOTHER SYSTEM WORK ONSHORE FOR FOLKS OUT WEST AND THAT WILL BRING THE POTENTIAL FOR MORE RAIN AND SNOW FOR FOLKS THERE. >> WHAT HAPPENED TO WINTER BEAUTY? >>. I HAVE MORE BAD NEWS. WE SPRING FORWARD BUT GO TO THE MIDDLE OF THE COUNTRY >> WIN UGLY WEEKEND >>.

IT HAPPENED IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE COUNTRY AND IT'S THE SECOND MASK ADDUCTION WE HAVE SEEN IN LESS THAN A WEEK.

HE SPOTTED, EXPOSED BONE. SO CREWS DUG IT UP AND THEY REALIZE THIS INCREDIBLE FIND. THE FACT: HE WAS WALKING HIS DOG AND MADE THIS DISCOVERY OF DINOSAUR BONES. >> THE DISCOVERY, AS WELL AS THE METHOD IS MIND BLOWING >>. THE DOG IS LIKE -- THIS IS A VERY LARGE ONE. >>>. WE ARE CELEBRATING INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY BY LOOKING CLOSER AT THE QUALITY IN THE WORKPLACE. DESPITE MAJOR STRIDES, WOMEN ARE STILL STRUGGLING TO MAKE THE SAME MONEY AND HOLD THE SAME POSITIONS AS MEN. WHERE ARE WOMEN FOR HOSTING THE MOST OBSTACLES. RACHEL THOMAS JOINS US NOW. THE CEO OF LEAN IN NONPROFIT THAT HELPS WOMEN ACHIEVE AMBITIONS AND HELPS COMPANIES MAKE WORKPLACES MORE INCLUSIVE. HAPPY INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. TELL US THE CHALLENGES WOMEN STILL FACE AND WHERE PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE WHEN IT COMES TO PAY AND REPRESENTATION >>. IT'S A DAY ABOUT CELEBRATING HOW FAR WE HAVE COME TO YOUR POINT. THE LAST 100 YEARS, SINCE THE FIRST INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY, WOMEN HAVE MADE A LOT OF STRAINS. IT'S IS WHAT DATA REFLECT ON THE PROGRESS WE NEED TO MAKE. DESPITE THE SAME NUMBER OF COLLEGE DEGREES AND MORE COLLEGE DEGREES SINCE THE 1980s. WOMEN ARE STILL UNDERREPRESENTED AT ALMOST EVERY LEVEL IN ORGANIZATIONS. WHEN YOU GET TO THE C-SUITE, ONLY ONE IN FOUR IS A WOMAN AND ONLY ONE IN EIGHT IS A WOMAN OF COLOR. IN THE 1960s, EQUAL PAY ACT WAS PASSED IN. WOMEN STILL ARE PAID $.74 ON THE DOLLAR. FOR EVERY DOLLAR, A WHITE MAN MAKES IT'S EVEN WORSE FOR WOMEN OF COLOR. WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS, BUT TODAY I THINK IT'S A DAY TO REFLECT ON HOW SLOW IT'S BEEN IN SOME INSTANCES AND HOW MUCH MORE WORK WE NEED TO DO. >>. WHY IS IT SO IMPORTANT- LET'S TALK TO THE CONCEPT OF REPRESENTATION- TO HAVE WOMEN FROM TOP TO BOTTOM IN DIFFERENT ROLES, ESPECIALLY AT THE TOP OF HER PEERS, TO SEE THAT AND PEOPLE COMING UP THE LADDER AND SAY: I CAN DO THAT, HOW CAN YOU CHANGE A WORKPLACE? >>. THERE'S LOTS OF RESEARCH THAT SHOWS WOMEN IN LEADERSHIP AND MORE DIVERSITY AND LEADERSHIP OVERALL. GOOD THINGS HAPPEN. COMPANY POLICIES TEND TO BE KINDER TO EMPLOYEES. MORE EMPLOYEE FRIENDLY, THE BOTTOM LINE IS BETTER AND INNOVATION IS STRONGER. THERE ARE LOTS OF REASONS WHY COMPANIES SHOULD CONTINUE TO INVEST HEAVILY AND GETTING TO GENDER EQUALITY AND DIVERSITY MORE BROADLY. THE THEME OF THE INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY THIS YEAR IS INSPIRING SOLUTION. IT'S NOT JUST GETTING WOMEN IN THE ROOM WHERE BIG DECISIONS ARE MADE, BUT MAKING SURE THEY ARE MADE, BUT MAKING SURE THEY ARE RESPECTED AND VALUED AND FEEL INCLUDED. SO WE DON'T JUST HAVE DIVERSITY, WE CAN TAP INTO THE BEST OF THE DIVERSITY, THE BEST THINKING AND BEST IDEAS >>. WE CAN HAVE THIS CONVERSATION WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT MEN IN THE PICTURE AND HOW IT FACTORS IN. WHAT CAN MAN DO TO HELP ADVANCE WOMEN AROUND THEM? HOW CAN THEY BE PART OF THE CONVERSATION? >>. FOR MEN, AND WOMEN TOO, ELDERSHIP IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. IF YOU ARE IN A POSITION OF POWER, HOW CAN YOU LIFT THE PEOPLE AROUND YOU- WOMEN, PEOPLE OF COLOR, AND MAKE SURE THEIR WORK IS GETTING NOTICED AND THEY GET THE SPONSORSHIP THEY NEED TALKING ABOUT THE BIASES THAT WOMEN, PEOPLE OF COLOR AND OTHER PEOPLE, TRADITIONALLY MARGINALIZED IDENTITIES, PHASE. WE KNOW FROM RESEARCH THAT WE CONDUCT EVERY YEAR WITH McKINSEY AND COMPANY THAT MOST WHITE EMPLOYEES OF ALL GENDERS SEE THEMSELVES AS SPONSORS AND ALLIES TO WOMEN OF COLOR. WHEN YOU ASK ABOUT THE SPECIFICS YOU ADVOCATING FOR WOMEN OF COLOR, DO YOU SPONSOR A WOMAN OF COLOR? GENDER DIVERSITY IN THE WORKPLACE: ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT RACIAL DIVERSITY IN NUMBERS? DROP LIKE A ROCK. THERE'S A LOT OF INTAN BUT WE NEED TO KEEP PUSHING HARDER. SO EMPLOYEES KNOW AT ALL LEVELS AND ALL GENDERS WITH A NEED TO SHOW AS AN ALLY, AND THAT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR MEN. >>. RACHEL THOMAS, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

THE SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF READINESS COLLEGE ASSESSMENT. WHAT IS THE MOTIVATION FOR MOVING THE TEST? ONLINE TALK IS THROUGH ANY CHANGES. IT'S A LITTLE SHORTER ALSO. >>. THAT IS RIGHT. STARTING TOMORROW MORNING STUDENTS IN US CAN TAKE. THE STUDENTS ARE DOING SO MUCH OF THEIR LIVING AND THEY ARE LEARNING AND OTHER TESTING. WE KEPT HEARING FROM STUDENTS AND TEACHERS, AS WE TALKED WITH THEM, THAT THEY FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE TAKING A TEST DIGITALLY: THE SCANTRON BUBBLE, SHE AND NUMBER 2, PENCIL- THE FEAR OF MISSING A ROW, GENUINE SOURCE OF STRESS FOR STUDENTS. WE WANT TO CATCH UP WITH WHERE STUDENTS ARE AND MAKE SURE, AS THEY TAKE THIS IMPORTANT TEST, THAT THEY FEEL AS CONFIDENT AS POSSIBLE >>. IT IS SO PART OF WHAT WE WENT THROUGH THE BUBBLE AND THE PENCIL BUT WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU USED A PENCIL? OTHERWISE, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN: A CONDUCT -- THEY CONDUCTED A FOCUS GROUP AND ASKED STUDENTS HOW THEY FELT ABOUT THIS. >>. WE DID A LOT OF PILOT AND FOCUS GROUPING IN THE YEARS LEADING TO THE ANNOUNCEMENT IN 2022 AND THE LAST FEW YEARS, BUT WE HAVE GONE A STEP FURTHER. ONE YEAR AGO, MARCH 2023, THE SAT TRANSITIONED FROM PAPER TO DIGITAL. IN THE REST OF THE WORLD AND OVER 180 COUNTRIES, THE DIGITAL SAT IS, AND HAS BEEN FOR OVER A YEAR, AND WE HAVE GIVEN 300,000 AROUND THE WORLD. AT THIS POINT, THE RESPONSE HAS BEEN OVERWHELMINGLY POSITIVE. I WILL SHARED TWO STATS. THE FIRST IS WE SENT THE SURVEY AFTER EVERY SAT TO STUDENTS WHO TAKE IT. OVER THOSE 300,000 INTERNATIONALLY. 84% OF STUDENTS AND 99% OF EDUCATORS WHO ADMINISTER IT REPORTED THEY HAD A BETTER EXPERIENCE WITH THE DIGITAL SAT THAN WITH THE PAPER. A CLEAR IMPROVEMENT. IN THE EYES OF STUDENTS AND EDUCATORS, IT FEELS MORE NATURAL FOR STUDENTS TO DO IT DIGITALLY. WE WERE ABLE TO MAKE IT SHORTER AS WELL, INSTEAD OF BEING THREE HOURS LONG. IT'S CLOSER TO TWO AND WE MADE CHANGES IN THE READING AND WRITING SECTION AND MAP SECTION. STILL TEST THE SAME CORE VALUES, BUT DOES IT DIFFERENTLY AND MORE EFFICIENTLY. AND THAT'S RESONATING WITH STUDENTS AND BRINGING THE STRESS LEVEL DOWN. >>> WE ARE SPRINGING FORWARD THIS WEEKEND >> DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME WILL BE BACK IN THE MIX.

IT'S IMPRESSIVE. WE HAVE BEEN BELOW 4% AS WE HAVE BEEN FOR OVER A YEAR- PRETTY IMPRESSIVE. >> BREAK IT DOWN BY CATEGORY: WHERE ARE THE BIGGEST GAINS OR LOSSES? >> BIG GAINS IN HEALTH CARE AND LEISURE AND HOSPITALITY: 58,000 JOBS ADDED IN THE MONTH, AND THAT WAS IMPRESSIVE. WE HAVE SEEN SLOWDOWNS IN SOME WHITE-COLLAR JOBS, SPECIFICALLY BUSINESS SERVICES AND INFORMATION. THESE WILL COVER THE TECH SECTORS WHICH ARE SEEING LAYOFFS ALTHOUGH. NOT AT THE MAGNITUDE WE SAW, BUT ONE YEAR AGO. INFORMATION: ONLY 2000 JOBS WERE ADDED IN THE MONTH. BANNED PROFESSIONAL BUSINESS SERVICES: ONLY 9000.. WE DON'T ALWAYS HIGHLIGHT SMALL NUMBER IN THE CATEGORY BREAKDOWN BUT IT'S WORTH WATCHING AS YOU SEE THE LARGER TECH COMPANIES AND SMALLER TECH COMPANIES CONTINUING TO TRIM EVEN AFTER LAST YEAR'S BRUTAL LAYOFFS. WE WILL CONTINUE TO WATCH THAT. >> TALK ABOUT WAGE GROWTH >>. THE WHOLE STORY IS INFLATION IS ERODING PEOPLE'S POCKETS, BOOKS, PRICES AT THE STORE GOING UP 3.1%. THAT'S ALL RIGHT IF WAGES ARE HIGHER ON A YEARLY BASIS, WHICH TO GO UP BY 4.3% OF FEBRUARY THIS YEAR COMPARED TO FEBRUARY OF LAST YEAR, SO THAT DOES OUTPACE INFLATION. CAN THAT HOLD. THAT MIGHT EXPLAIN THE ECONOMIC SENTIMENT: CONSUMERS FEELING BETTER THAN A YEAR AGO. BUT THE POLLING STILL SHOWING THAT PEOPLE ARE VERY MUCH FEELING HOW THE ECONOMY IS. >>. THE FEDERAL RESERVE POLICYMAKERS MEETING COULD HAVE IMPACT ON INTEREST RATES >>. THEY ARE PROBABLY LOOKING AT THIS NUMBER WAGE. GROWTH IS SOMETHING. THEY WANT ABOVE THE RATE OF INFLATION TO MAKE SURE THE ECONOMY -- SO IT WON'T CONTINUE ERODING POCKETBOOKS. THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS STOPPED TAKING INTEREST RATES FOR A WHILE. THE LAST HIKE WAS IN THE SUMMER OF LAST YEAR. THE NEXT STEP WOULD LIKELY BE CUTTING INTEREST RATES. THAT'S WHAT JEROME POWELL SAID IN TESTIMONY THIS WEEK RIGHT. NOW THEY WANT TO SEE MORE SIGNS OF CONFIDENCE THAT THIS NUMBER INFLATION IS NOT GOING TO RISE ANY FURTHER. WILL GET ANOTHER PRINT DONE INFLATION NEXT WEEK AND THAT WILL BE UP BIG ONE FOR THE TIMING FOR A RATE CUT. IT MAY BE AT SOME POINT LATER ON. >>>. THOSE OF US WHO START WORK REALLY KNOW ALL TOO WELL. YOU WILL LOSE AN HOUR OF SLEEP. DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME RETURNS EARLY SUNDAY MORNING. MOST AMERICANS SAY THEY WANT TO GET RID OF THESE TIME CHANGES, AND LAWMAKERS ARE STRUGGLING TO FIGURE THE BEST APPROACH. SHOULD WE GO WITH 12 MONTHS OF DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME OR STANDARD TIME? >>. Reporter. ON SUNDAY MORNING, WHEN YOU SLUGGISHLY STIR FROM YOUR SLUMBER, YOU MIGHT BE QUOTING CHER. >> IF I COULD TURN BACK TIME. >>. Reporter, WISHING YOU COULD TURN BACK TIME, REGAINING THE HOUR THAT WAS SNATCHED AS YOU SNOOZED ANGER EXPRESSED ON TIKTOK. >> IT WILL TAKE AT LEAST TWO WEEKS TO GET BACK IN ORDER. >>. Reporter. ALTHOUGH WITH THE SUN RISING LATER AND SETTING LATER, SOME SEE DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME -- >>. SPRING IS COMING, >>. Reporter, WHAT NEARLY TWO THIRDS OF AMERICANS AGREE ON. THEY WANT TO STOP SPRINGING FORWARD AND FALLING BACK, A PRACTICE THAT STARTED MORE THAN A CENTURY AGO. THIS WEEK, OREGON STATE SENATE NARROWLY PASSED A BILL THAT WOULD MAKE STANDARD TIME PERMANENT, BUT ONLY IF CALIFORNIA AND WASHINGTON STATE TO THE SAME. >>. THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT THIS BILL GENERATED CONTROVERSY. >>. Reporter. FEDERAL LAW SAYS STATES CAN DO STANDARD TIME YEAR-ROUND, SOMETHING EUROZONE AND HAWAII ALREADY DO. BUT MANY WOULD RATHER HAVE DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME ALL THE TIME. THAT WOULD REQUIRE AN ACT OF CONGRESS- SOMETHING THEY KEEP STALLING. SUPPORTERS SAY MORE PM. SUNLIGHT MEANS MORE SHOPPING AND OUTDOOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. AFTER WORK >> WE CAN START WEARING T- SHIRTS AND BIKER SHORTS FOR OUR WALK >>. Reporter MANY FEEL IT'S BEST TO STICK TO STANDER WITH MORE DAYLIGHT IN THE MORNING. >>. DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME. WE WILL -- >>. Reporter. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN A RISE IN CAR ACCIDENTS AFTER SPRINGING CLOCKS FORWARD ALONG, WITH A SPIKE IN HEART ATTACKS ALTHOUGH. A NEW STUDY BY THE MAYO CLINIC SAYS THE EFFECT OF DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME ON HEART HEALTH IS LIKELY MINIMAL. WE WILL DO IT AGAIN THIS WEEKEND. SOMETHING YOU WILL MOST LIKELY LOSE SLEEP OVER. MOST LIKELY LOSE SLEEP OVER >>. THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE OF STATE LEGISLATURES SAID OVER THE PAST DECADE MORE THAN 500 BILLS AND RESOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS TIME CHANGES HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED. A DOZEN STATES ARE LOOKING AT IT RIGHT NOW, BUT THERE ARE STRONG OPINIONS ON BOTH SIDES, AND THAT MAKES IT TRICKY. >>. HOW CAN YOU MAKE SURE THAT THE TIMESHIFT IS AS PAINLESS AS POSSIBLE? JOINING US IS A SLEEP PSYCHOLOGIST AND RESEARCHER AT DUKE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE. FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE, WHO STRUGGLES THE MOST OTHER THAN MORNING SHOW ANCHORS FROM THE TRANSITION. AND WHERE DO YOU STAND ON THIS? HE DID DEBATE OVER WHAT WE SHOULD DO. >>. WE SHOULD HAVE PERMANENT STANDARD TIME. THERE IS NO QUESTION. THE SCIENCE MAKES SENSE. IT MATCHES OUR BIOLOGICAL CLOCKS BETTER. WE NEED THEM MORNING SUN AND WE DON'T NEED AS MUCH IN THE EVENING. YOUNG CHILDREN AND THEIR PARENTS REALLY STRUGGLE. THEY ARE SENSITIVE TO LIGHT. IMAGINE IN THE SUMMER WHEN IT'S STILL BRIGHT OUTSIDE AT 9:30 PM. IT WILL BE HARD FOR THE LITTLE ONES TO GET ENOUGH SLEEP FOR THEIR BRAIN DEVELOPMENT AND PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL HEALTH THEY NEED THAT SLEEP. PARENTS SUFFER BECAUSE THEY LOSE SLEEP OVER THIS. I STRONGLY IN PERMANENT STANDARD TIME >>. WHAT WILL HAPPEN THIS WEEKEND, JUSTIN THE TIME BY ONE HOUR. IT MAY NOT SEEM SIGNIFICANT, BUT GETTING LESS SLEEP CAN AFFECT PEOPLE ESPECIALLY THE DAYS AFTER WE MAKE THE SWITCH. WHAT ARE SYMPTOMS WE SHOULD WATCH OUT FOR? >> I WOULD TRY TO STAY OFF THE ROADS. WE SEE MORE CAR ACCIDENTS ON THE DAY OR SO AFTER THE CHANGE. ALSO I URGE PEOPLE TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR MENTAL HEALTH. SEE YOUR FRIENDS AND EXERCISE AND EAT WELL AND TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF. SUICIDAL BEHAVIORS AND IDEATION CAN SPIKE. AFTER THE TIME CHANGE AS WELL ALL AROUND PLAN TO SUNDAY: FUN DAY, LOAD UP SUNDAY WAS SOMETHING MORE ENJOYABLE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO PREPARE FOR THE TIMESHIFT. >>. WHEN SHOULD PEOPLE EXPECT THEIR BACK TO NORMAL AND FORGET? THIS HAPPENED AND WE ARE IN DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME >>. IT TAKES ABOUT 4 TO 7 DAYS. THE NBC NEWS NOW DECREASE THAT. DOES THAT MEAN THAT WE CAN GO BACK TO NORMAL LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED. WE ARE STILL SUFFERING FROM THE LOSS OF NOT ONLY THE HOUR OF SLEEP BUT ALSO A MISMATCH BETWEEN OUR BIOLOGICAL CLOCK AND THE CLOCK ON THE WALL THAT WILL STICK AROUND FOR MONTHS >>. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. IT'S HARD TO TALK ABOUT BUT WE'VE GOT TO TALK ABOUT IT >>>. WE ARE HEADING INTO A BLOCKBUSTER WEEKEND. >>. THE OSCARS ARE ON SUNDAY.

257,MKeS_FFS_ME,Hallie Jackson NOW - March 6 | NBC News NOW,NBC News,2024-03-07 04:21:28+00:00,"THANK YOU FOR THAT REPORT. KRISTIN IS BACK TOMORROW WITH MORE MEET THE PRESS. NOW THE NEWS CONTINUES WITH HALLIE. THE NEWS CONTINUES WITH HALLIE JACKSON RIGHT NOW>>> â™ª, â™ª >>. WE ARE COMING ON THEIR BUCKLED IN AND SCREAMING TOWARD THE GENERAL ELECTION IN NOVEMBER. NOW THAT IT IS UNOFFICIALLY OFFICIAL, THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN AND FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL GO HEAD-TO-HEAD AGAIN. NIKKI HALEY TODAY BOWING OUT WHAT HAPPENS NEXT IN THIS NEW PHASE OF THE CAMPAIGN. WE WILL TALK ABOUT WHY THE PROSPECT OF DEBATE MATCHUP IS CERTAINLY ON THE TABLE. ALSO, BREAKING NEWS OUT OF THE MIDDLE EAST: TWO SAILORS KILLED BY HOUTHI REBELS. THE FIRST DEATH NEAR THE RED SEA SINCE ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR STARTED. WHAT THE PENTAGON IS SAYING NEW CONCERNS ABOUT A POTENTIAL CIVIL WAR IN HAITI BY THE STATE DEPARTMENT ONCE A COUNTRY'S PRIME MINISTER TO HURRY UP AND STEP DOWN ASAP. >>> A NEW PLAN BY THE TSA TO GET YOU THROUGH THE AIRPORT FASTER. IT'S KIND OF LIKE SELF CHECKOUT. THE QUESTION OF SPEED VERSUS SECURITY IS COMING UP. WE WILL GET INTO IT. HOW SOME SILICON VALLEY INVESTORS WANT REVIVE NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS TO FUEL THE AI REVOLUTION. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? WE ARE GETTING INTO THAT A LITTLE BIT LATER ON THE SHOW >>>. HEY, THERE I'M, HALLE TONIGHT. THE LONGEST GENERAL ELECTION IN A GENERATION BEGINS DONALD TRUMP, NOW THE PRESUMPTIVE PUBLICAN NOMINEE SETTING UP A REMATCH WITH PRESIDENT BIDEN. WE HAVEN'T HAD THE MAJOR CANDIDATES LOCKED DOWN THIS EARLY SINCE MY SPACE HIT 1 MILLION USERS IN 2004.. THAT MEANS WE WILL TIE THE RECORD THAT YEAR: 244 DAYS UNTIL THE GENERAL ELECTION. AFTER 243 OF THEM, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO AVOID THE MOMENT. GO THE POLLS SHOW. MOST AMERICANS HAVE BEEN DREADING AN ELECTION DAY FEATURING DONALD TRUMP VERSUS JOE BIDEN. MORE THAN HALF OF VOTERS SAYING THEY DON'T WANT EITHER AS THEIR NOMINEE. TWO THIRDS SAY THEY WANT SOMEBODY NEW. THEY ARE NOT GETTING IT THIS TIME. WE ARE AT THIS POINT AFTER NIKKI HALEY TODAY DECIDED HER TIME IS UP. AFTER SHE WON JUST ONE STATE ON SUPER TUESDAY. AS SHE DROPS OUT OF THE RACE, SHE IS TOSSING A CHALLENGE: MR TRUMP'S WAY WATCH. >>. IT IS NOW UP TO DONALD TRUMP TO EARN THE VOTES OF THOSE IN OUR PARTY AND BEYOND IT WHO DID NOT SUPPORT HIM. I HOPE HE DOES THAT. AT ITS BEST, POLITICS IS ABOUT BRINGING PEOPLE INTO YOUR CAUSE CAUSE, NOT TURNING THEM AWAY. >>. FOR HIS, THE FORMER PRESIDENT, KNOCKING HALEY EVEN AS HE INVITES HER SUPPORTERS TO GET BEHIND HIM. A DIRECTIVE, IF YOU WILL, TO FALL IN LINE AS THE LAST HOLDOUTS IN HIS PARTY ARE DOING JUST THAT, INCLUDING A FORMALLY ELECTED MITCH McCONNELL, WHO SUMMED UP HIS ENDORSEMENT OF MR TRUMP TODAY BY GUSHING EXUBERANTLY THAT MR TRUMP HAS- I'M QUOTING HERE- REQUISITE SUPPORT OF REPUBLICAN VOTERS. MAYBE NOT EXUBERANT AS RESIGNATION TO THE REALITY THAT THIS IS DONALD TRUMP'S PARTY, PRESIDENT BIDEN'S TO HOPING HE CAN PILL WAY SOME OF THE HILLY SUPPORTERS WHO FEEL THERE IS NOT A PLACE FOR THEM IN THE MAG A MOVEMENT. THE QUESTION WE HAVE: WHERE THOSE VOTERS GOING TO GO? A COUPLE OF KEY STATES SHOW A CHUNK OF NIKKI HALEY VOTERS NOT PROMISING TO BACK DOWN. THE TRUMP DOES THAT MEAN THEY WILL GO FOR BEEP --, PRESIDENT BIDEN, OR STAY HOME. WE WILL GET THE VIEW FROM HALEY WORLD WITH ALLIE VITELLI IN JUST A SECOND. I WANT TO STOCK. -- STEP IN WITH GARRETT HAYES. YOU GOT THE FORMER PRESIDENT SAYING HE WANTS THE PARTY TO UNIFY. BEHIND HIM YOU PULL UP SOME OF THE EXIT, POLLING ABOUT. 60% OF VOTERS IN THESE THREE KEY STATES SAY THEY JUST DON'T FEEL PART OF THE MAG MOVEMENT. HE'S GOT TO BRING THEM IN SOMEWHERE. THIS IS SOMETHING YOU HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT WITH FOLKS IN YOUR ORBIT AS WELL >>. YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT HALLE. I THINK YOU CHARACTERIZED IT CORRECTLY. HE ONCE A PARTY TO UNIFY, BUT HE WANTS IT TO HAPPEN ON HIS TERMS. DONALD TRUMP HAS MADE NO EFFORT TO REACH OUT OR SOMEHOW TEMPER HIS STYLE OR CHANGE HIS POLICY POSITIONS IN SUCH A WAY AS TO APPEAL TO THAT SECTION OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WHO HASN'T SUPPORTED HIM TO THE DEGREE HAS MADE THIS A FOCAL POINT. ALL HE HAS DONE IT ALMOST ENTIRELY THROUGH THE LENS OF ALLOWING JOE BIDEN TO PUSH SOME REPUBLICANS BACK INTO HIS ORBIT. I ASKED HIM ABOUT THIS ALL THE WAY BACK DURING THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY. HERE'S WHAT HE TOLD ME THEN, AND IT'S STILL OPERABLE NOW. >> HOW DO YOU BRING THEM BACK IN? >>. THERE GOING TO ALTHOUGH FOR ME AGAIN, EVERYBODY. I'M NOT SURE WE NEED TO MANY. I'M NOT SURE. I THINK BIDEN IS THE WORST PRESIDENT IN HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY. BUT THEY ARE ALL COMING BACK. I THINK YOU SEE THAT HERE>>. AS WE GET INTO MARCH 2, THINGS ARE STILL TRUE. NUMBER ONE, THE BIDEN PART OF NUMBER ONE, THE BIDEN PART OF THIS WORK. TO HIS ADVANTAGE OF, HE WILL PUSH VOTERS BACK INTO DONALD TRUMP'S CAMP. THE OTHER PART OF THIS IS THEY DON'T THINK THIS IS AS BIG OF A PROBLEM AS THE DATA THAT YOU JUST SHOWED MIGHT INDICATE. THEY LOOK AT SWING STATE POLLS THAT STILL SHOW DONALD TRUMP COMFORTABLY HAD OF JOE BIDEN AND THINK THAT PERHAPS THEY DON'T NEED AS MANY OF THESE NIKKI HALEY VOTERS BACK AS YOU OR I MIGHT BELIEVE >>. YEAH, ESSENTIALLY A RISKY BET. WE WILL SEE. YOU HAVE ALSO GOT. COME AS WE TALK ABOUT THE GENERAL ELECTION, 244 DAYS AWAY, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS THE HALLMARK OF THE FALL PRE-ELECTION IS, TYPICALLY, DEBATES BETWEEN TWO CANDIDATES IN LAST COUPLE OF HOURS, AND THIS HAS BEEN AN OPEN QUESTION SINCE DONALD TRUMP DIDN'T DO ANY OF THE RIEMER DEBATES. SOUNDS LIKE MAYBE HE WOULD DO ONE WITH PRESIDENT BIDEN. TALK ESTER IT >>. YEAH, NOT JUST MAYBE. ACCORDING TO THIS TRUTH SOCIAL POST, HE SAID HE'S READY TO DO DEBATES ANYTIME, ANYWHERE, ANYPLACE >> MAR-A-LAGO >> INCLUDING ON MSNBC OR ON THE COMMISSION OF PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES WHICH, IRONICALLY, COME THE REPUBLICAN PARTY VOTED TO BOYCOTT IN 2022 AT DONALD TRUMP'S DIRECTION. IT SHOWS YOU THE WAY THE POLITICAL WIND HAS CHANGED HERE. THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND DONALD TRUMP FEELS LIKE ONE-ON-ONE AGAINST JOE BIDEN. HE PUTS ON THE BETTER SHOWING. I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE PRESENT, WHO HAS NOT TO BE DISSIPATING IN ANY DEBATE. BY SUGGESTING THEY TO DO THIS NOW AND WOULD OFTEN, THEY MAY BE LEAVING THEIR OWN HYPE TOO MUCH BECAUSE MOST MIGHT ULTIMATELY FIND OUT WHETHER. NOT THEY THINK THE PRESENT WILL BE A WEAKER DEBATER THAN DONALD TRUMP, I WILL SAY HISTORICALLY INCOMING PRESENCE ALMOST, ALWAYS SOMETHING THAT FIRST DEBATE. IT MAY BE A GOOD TACTICAL RISK HERE I DONALD TRUMP, TO FORCE THIS ISSUE NOW >>. WATCHING FROM A PERCH NEAR PALM BEACH- GARRETT, THANK YOU. ALLIE VITELLI IS ALSO PURGED IN CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA PERHAPS, FOR THE LAST NIGHT, AFTER MONTHS OF FOLLOWING NIKKI HALEY ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. WHAT HAS BEEN INTERESTING HAS BEEN THIS QUESTION- WHAT HER TONE WOULD BE FOR YOU AND I WORKED TOGETHER ON A SPECIAL REPORT. EARLIER AS SHE WAS MAKING THAT ANNOUNCEMENT, SHE CONGRATULATED DONALD TRUMP. SHE TALKED ABOUT BEING A CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN. WHAT SHE DIDN'T SAY WAS: HEY, EVERYBODY WHO SUPPORTED ME, GO OUT AND SUPPORT THE ARMOR PRESIDENT. SHE ENCOURAGED PEOPLE TO MAKE UP THEIR OWN MINDS ABOUT IT >>. IT SEEMS LIKE SHE IS STILL KIND OF MAKING A PURSE WITH THE OTHER HALF OF THAT SENTENCE WAS WHEN SHE SAID I'M A CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN. THE NEXT THING SHE SAYS WAS I WAS BACK TO THE PARTY'S NOMINEE AND THEN SHE DIDN'T BACK THE PARTY'S NOMINEE. THIS MIGHT BE A CLUE AS TO WHY, THOUGH THIS LIST OF POLICY THINGS THAT SHE HAS DIFFERENT WITH DONALD TRUMP WATCH >>. A SMALLER FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS NOT ONLY NECESSARY FOR OUR FREEDOM, IT IS NECESSARY FOR OUR SURVIVAL. TERM LIMITS FOR WASHINGTON POLITICIANS ARE NEEDED NOW MORE THAN EVER. STANDING BY OUR ALLIES IN UKRAINE, ISRAEL AND TAIWAN IS A MORAL IMPERATIVE >>. IT'S THAT LAST ONE HALLE THAT I THINK IS SO IMPORTANT. THE WAY THAT NIKKI HALEY HAS REALLY A BREAK FROM THE FOREIGN POLICY PERSPECTIVE, EVEN AS THOSE IN HER OWN REPUBLICAN PARTY BACK WAKE FROM CONTINUED AID LIKE TO ALLIES, LIKE UKRAINE EIGHT ISRAEL CUT UP ANOTHER THORNY POLITICS ISSUES. THE FACT THAT HALEY HAS BEEN CLEAR WRITING CONSISTENT THEIR MIXER VERY DIFFERENT THAN HER FORMER BOSS, WHO HAS NOT HAD MUCH TO SAY, IF ANYTHING NEGATIVE, ABOUT VLADIMIR PUTIN. HE EVEN IN THE WAKE OF THE MURDER OF HIS POLITICAL DISSIDENTS AND TOP POLITICAL CRITIC IN RUSSIA, ALEXEI NAVALNY, JUST WEEKS AGO. FOR HALEY, THOSE ARE KEY DIFFERENCES IN MY EXPLAIN: THE LACK OF ENDORSEMENT, THE QUESTIONS. WE LAY THIS OUT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SHOW. WHAT HAPPENS? NIKKI HALEY IS NOT GETTING THE MAJORITY OF THE REPUBLICAN ELECTRIC. THAT'S WHY SHE'S NOT IN THE RACE ANYMORE. SHE DIDN'T GET ZERO. THERE WASN'T MUCH, BUT THERE WAS SOME SLIVER OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WHO BACKED HER EVEN. THOUGH WE TALKED ABOUT GARRETT SINGH. THERE'S AN OPEN QUESTION AS TO HOW MUCH THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN FEELS LIKE THEY NEED TO EXTEND ANY OLIVE BRANCHES TO THAT SLICE. WE KNOW BRANCHES TO THAT SLICE. WE KNOW THAT THIS IS ANY SIMILARITIES TO 2020, IT'S GOING TO BE CLOSE, SUPER CLOSE. MARGINS ARE SUPERTIGHT, WHICH IS WHY SOME OF THESE SUBURBAN WOMEN IN KEY SWING STATES MATTER THE VERY FOLKS WHO SEEMED TO FAVOR NIKKI HALEY IN SOME OF THESE EARLY PRIMARIES. LET ME PLAY A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT THESE VOTERS TOLD YOU. OUR TEAM OTHERS WATCH >>. THAT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION. IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE BIDEN >>. I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED WITH TRUMP BUT AT THE SAME TIME, IF IT'S BETWEEN TRUMP AND BIDEN, I WOULD PROBABLY VOTE FOR TRUMP. >> DIVIDED BUT ALSO RELUCTANT, WHICH SPEAKS TO THE IDEA THAT THE OTHER CHALLENGER HERE, IN A DONALD TRUMP, JOE BIDEN SET UP, IS VOTER APATHY >>. WHAT IF THEY STAY HOME? FRANKLY? I HAVE HEARD FROM THOSE VOTERS WHO LOATHE HAVING TO MAKE THIS CHOICE AND ALSO, SO MAYBE I JUST DON'T MAKE IT. MAYBE I VOTE DOWN BALLOT, MAYBE I JUST STAY HOME. WHEN YOU LOOK AT STATES LIKE WISCONSIN OR MICHIGAN OR, ESPECIALLY, GEORGIA, WHICH BIDEN WAS ABLE TO FLIP, WE KNOW THAT THESE ARE STATES THAT TURN ON TENS OF THOUSANDS OF BALLOTS. THAT IS NOT A LOT OF BALLOTS, SO FOR PEOPLE TO SAY THEY ARE STAYING HOME. THAT WOULD CERTAINLY IMPACT THE TURNOUT QUESTION AND COULD IMPACT THE WAY THAT THESE STATES GO. IT COULD ALSO BE IMPACTFUL IF YOU ARE TRUMP AND YOU ARE LOSING VOTES FROM WOULD BE REPUBLICANS. THAT COULD BE ENOUGH TO HELP BIDEN, FOR BOTH PARTIES ARE SORT OF FIGHTING. THIS APATHY QUESTIONED RIGHT NOW AND HALEY SUPPORTERS ARE IN FRONT OF THAT PACK. >> ALLIE VITELLI, LIVE IN SOUTH CAROLINA. WHERE TO GO? NEXT, NEXT, YOU KNOW YET. >> TO MY BED TO SLEEP. >> ENJOY, YOU DESERVE IT. >>. THANK YOU, ALLEY. >> APPRECIATE ALL YOU, YOUR COVERAGE AND THANK YOU TO YOUR TEAM AS WELL. >>>. NOW TO THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES NOMINEE. WE SHOULD SAY PRESIDENT BIDEN GETTING READY TO MAKE A RESPONSE TO MR, TO MAKE A RESPONSE TO MR TRUMP'S SUPER TUESDAY NEAR SWEEP AT TOMORROW'S STATE OF THE UNION. LOOK AT THIS GRAPHIC. THESE ARE ALL. THESE ARE THE TOP 100. LIVE BROADCAST LAST YEAR. SEE ALL OF THOSE FOOTBALLS. IT WAS LIKE: ALL SPORTS ALMOST, EXCEPT FOR THREE THINGS: THE OSCARS, THE THANKSGIVING DAY PARADE. YOU SEE IT THERE. AND SEE THAT LITTLE ICON, THE STATE OF THE UNION. THAT LITTLE FLAG ON THE 21st. IT'S A BIG DEAL. RIGHT THERE'S A LOT OF EYEBALLS ON THIS. FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN, OUR TEAMS REPORTING LOT OF HIS MESSAGE WILL BOIL DOWN. TO WHOSE SIDE. ARE YOU ON>> TO HEAR A LOT ABOUT THE QUESTIONS ABOUT IMMIGRATION AND THE BORDER, THE ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR, ALL OF IT, PART OF WHAT THE PRESIDENT SEES NOT AS A ONE NIGHT PRIME TIME EVENT BUT SOMETHING THAT LEADS UP TO A FULL ON FLOOD. THIS A MOMENT FOR HIS MESSAGE. KELLY O'DONNELL IS OUTSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE. FOR US, KELLY, THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE WHITE HOUSE. THE PRESIDENT, THESE MANY EYEBALLS, PERHAPS TO PUSH BACK TO ONE OF THE BIG VOTER CONCERNS ABOUT HIM COMING INTO NOVEMBER, WHICH IS HIS AGE, HIS FITNESS FOR OFFICE HERE. I'M INTERESTED TO SEE HOW YOU. I'M INTERESTED TO SEE HOW YOU MIGHT RESPOND ALL OF LAST YEAR TO AND HECKLING FROM THE ROOM. I KNEW WHEN THE TEAM HAVE SOME NEW REPORTING ON THAT AND A WHOLE BUNCH OF OTHER NUGGETS LEADING UP TO TOMORROW NIGHT. TALK US THROUGH IT >>. CERTAINLY HALLE, WHEN THE PRESIDENT KNOWS HE'S IN FRONT OF A ROOM IN WHICH INCLUDES HUNDREDS OF MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, AND WE KNOW THAT SORT OF THE DECORUM IN THE CHAMBER HAS LOOSENED UP TO PUT IT POLITELY OVER THE YEARS. IT COULD BE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WHO COULD HECKLE. IT COULD BE THOSE WHO ARE ATTENDING IN THE GALLERY. THERE ARE GUESTS OF EACH MEMBER OF CONGRESS AND SENATORS WHO ARE INVITED TO WITNESS THIS EXTRAORDINARY EVENT OF SEEING A STATE OF THE UNION IN PERSON. THERE MIGHT BE ON EITHER THE FAR RIGHT OR THE FAR LEFT- ON ISSUES AS WIDE-RANGING AS THE CEASE-FIRE DEMANDS IN GAZA TO IMMIGRATION AND THE BORDER. YOU CAN SEE HECKLING SO CLEARLY THE PRESENT AS PART OF HIS PREPARATION, WITH A SMALL GROUP OF SENIOR ADVISERS SPENDING TIME AT CAMP DAVID WORKING THROUGH ITERATIONS OF THE DRAFT AND PART OF IT, IS ANTICIPATING WHAT MIGHT BE SAID, WHAT MIGHT COME UP AND HOW BEST TO TRY TO RESPOND TO THAT. IN MANY WAYS, THE BIDEN, ADMINISTRATION, THE TEAM AROUND THE PRESIDENT WOULD SORT OF WELCOME ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS, BECAUSE THEY FELT THAT WHAT HAPPENED LAST YEAR, WITH SOME CALLING OUT RELATED TO SOCIAL SECURITY, GAVE THE PRESIDENT A MOMENT TO SHOW COMMAND OF THE ROOM, TO ALMOST NEGOTIATE IN REAL TIME WITH REPUBLICANS, TO AGREE, TO KNOW CUTS ON SOCIAL SECURITY AND HAVE A BIT OF A WIN IN THAT MOMENT BY PERCEPTION, BY DEMONSTRATING HIS AGILITY AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. SO THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY ALONG WITH PERIL WHEN IT COMES TO PREPARING FOR HECKLERS >>. I HAVE LIKE 90 MILLION MORE QUESTIONS FOR YOU IN A 90 MILLION MORE MINUTES. LET ME TAKE YOU THROUGH A COUPLE OF THEM. WE KNOW A POLICY. THERE'S A LOT OF INTERESTING TOPICS HERE. REPUBLICANS HAVE MADE IMMIGRATION FRONT AND CENTER IN IMMIGRATION FRONT AND CENTER IN THEIR 2024 PUSH TALKING TO THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN. THEY ALSO WANT FLIP THE SCRIPT ON IMMIGRATION AND TRY TO GET REPUBLICANS BACK ON THEIR HEELS AFTER CONGRESS FAILED TO PASS ANY MEANINGFUL GRATIAN REFORM >>. EXPECT TO HEAR THAT THE PRESENT WILL PUSH BACK TO SAY THE NECESSARY STEPS FOR, SAY THE NECESSARY STEPS FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER SECURITY REQUIRE FUNDING THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE BY CONGRESS TO PAY FOR THE BORDER PATROL AGENTS, TO PAY FOR MORE JUDGES, FOR ASYLUM COURTS AND SO FORTH. HE IS GOING TO SAY HE IS EXHAUSTED EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY. THEY DON'T PLAN TO UNVEIL ANY UNILATERAL STEPS. IT'S CONGRESS WHO HAS TO PASS THE MONEY AND THE POLICY TO GET IT DONE >>. KELLY VERY QUICKLY. WE TALKED ABOUT FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP, THIS IDEA THAT HE MAY WANT TO DEBATE PRESIDENT BIDEN, THIS IDEA THAT HE'S GOING TO BE WATCHING IN REAL TIME TOMORROW NIGHT. TEAM BIDEN SEEMS TO BE HEY, BRING IT ON. IF YOU'RE SO THIRSTY, JUST DO THAT. TALK US THROUGH THAT. >>. THEY RECOGNIZE THESE IN A MOMENT. MOMENTS CAN BE VERY HELPFUL. THEY ARE ALSO RISKY. THERE ARE HIGH STAKES. THEY WANT TO TALK -- DROP THE FORMER PRESIDENT AND SET UP THIS CONTEST AS A DIVIDE THAT HAS UNFOLDED NOW OF A REMATCH ELECTION, IN A NEW MOMENT WHERE THEY BELIEVE THEY CAN ARGUE THAT JOE BIDEN, EVEN IF YOU DON'T AGREE ON ALL OF HIS POLICIES, IS STILL THE SOUNDER CHOICE, THE BETTER CHOICE, AND SO THEY BELIEVE THAT TINGLING WITH THE FORMER PRESIDENT WILL REVEAL MORE OF WHAT MAKES ESPECIALLY ELUSIVE VOTERS UNSETTLED ABOUT HIM. KELLY >>. KELLY O'DONNELL, EXHIBIT HE ZIPPING THROUGH IT ALL FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. FOR US, THANK YOU >>>. NOW TO THE MIDDLE EAST, WITH DEVELOPING NEWS OUT OF THERE WE ARE LEARNING. HOUTHI REBELS HAVE KILLED AT LEAST TWO SAILORS IN A MISSILE ATTACK ON COMMERCIAL SHIPS. TODAY, THE FIRST TIME ANYONE HAS BEEN KILLED IN THE REBEL ATTACK SINCE THEY STARTED TARGETING SHIPS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WAR, RAISING POSSIBILITY. NOW AMERICAN TROOPS COULD RESPOND WITH YET ANOTHER ROUND OF STRIKES ON THE REBELS. COURTNEY QB IS FOLLOWING THIS ONE. FOR US, THE QUESTION: WHAT COULD THE RESPONSE BE? NOW THAT LIVES HAVE BEEN LOST. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THIS SITUATION, IN THIS CONFLICT >>, WE HAVE SEEN A SERIES OF ESCALATING RESPONSES FRANKLY. FROM THE FIRST TIME, THE US AND THE BRITISH MILITARY CAME TOGETHER AND CONDUCTED A ROUND OF AIR STRIKES INSIDE YEMEN. WE SAW ANOTHER ROUND OF THOSE JUST RECENTLY. US OFFICIALS HERE AT THE PENTAGON ARE SAYING YES, THEY ARE LOOKING AT OPTIONS FOR A RESPONSE. THE REALITY IS, HALLE, THERE'S ALSO A GROWING FRUSTRATION ABOUT THE FACT THAT THIS CONTINUING THESE AIR STRIKES, INCLUDING THE ONES THAT ARE OCCURRING ON A NEAR DAILY BASIS, THESE SO-CALLED DYNAMIC OR SELF DEFENSE STRIKES THAT THE US MILITARY IS TAKING EVERY SINGLE DAY. THEY DON'T SEEM TO BE DETERRING THE HOUTHIS. WE HAVE SEEN FIVE. HOUTHI IS LESS -- MISSILE ATTACKS AGAINST SHIPS- ONE HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY THAT KILLED TWO MARINER -- MARINERS- AND KILLED SIX -- INJURED OTHERS INJURED OTHERS THERE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE. THIS IS GOING TO BE A LONG-TERM PROCESS, BOTH TO DETER THE HOUTHI ATTACKS AND TO DEGRADE THEIR CAPABILITIES TO CARRY THEM OUT. THEM OUT >>. WHAT MATT MILLER JUST SAID ABOUT DEGRADING THEIR CAPABILITIES. THAT'S ONE OF THE BIG CHALLENGES HERE, HALLE. THE US DOESN'T HAVE A REALLY GOOD SENSE OF EXACTLY WHAT THE HOUTHIS HAVE IN THEIR ARSENAL REMEMBER. BEFORE NOVEMBER, THE US WASN'T REALLY PAYING A LOT OF ATTENTION TO THE HOUTHIS. THEY WERE NOT CONDUCTING THESE SORTS OF ATTACKS AGAINST A MARITIME ENVIRONMENT. NOW, THE WEST DOESN'T HAVE A REALLY STRONG BASELINE OF WHAT ALL THEY HAVE IN THEIR ARSENAL. THAT JUST MAKES THIS ALL THE MORE CHALLENGING. >> COURTNEY, LIVE AT THE PENTAGON, THANK YOU. >>> DOWN SOUTH RIGHT NOW ALABAMA LAWMAKERS ARE WORKING TO GET A BILL ON THE GOVERNOR'S DESK BY THE END OF THE DAY TO GET STATE IVF CLINICS OPEN AGAIN. YOU ARE LOOKING LIVE AT THE LEGISLATIVE SESSIONS THAT JUST STARTED THE SENATE IN THE LAST HOUR, THE STATE HOUSE- IN THE LAST 20 MINUTES THIS BILL WERE PROTECT FERTILITY CLINICS FROM LAWSUITS. AFTER THAT CONTROVERSIAL RULING BY THE ALABAMA SUPREME COURT, FROZEN EMBRYOS HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS AS CHILDREN STILL. SOME LAWYERS SAY THE BILL AS WRITTEN JUST DOESN'T DO ENOUGH -- BURNS IS COVERING THIS ONE LIVE FOR US FROM MONTGOMERY. ALABAMA TONIGHT EXPLAINED THAT PIECE OF WHAT THE BILL DOES AND DOES NOT DO AND WHAT YOUR HEARING FROM FOLKS ON THE GROUND >>. THE BILL IS BEING DEBATED ON THE HOUSE FLOOR RIGHT NOW AS WE. >>. WHAT THIS BILL DOES DO IS PROTECT CLINICS IN THE PROVIDERS- BASICALLY ALL THE FOLKS INVOLVED IN IVF TREATMENT- FROM LEGAL LIABILITY, CRIMINAL AND CIVIL LIABILITY, AND THAT MEANS THAT IF THIS WILL PASSES TONIGHT OR TOMORROW, THAT CLINICS WILL BE ABLE TO REOPEN. THERE ARE FAMILIES THAT HAVE BEEN ON ALERT FOR WEEKS NOW BEEN ON ALERT FOR WEEKS NOW AFTER THIS DECISION CAME OUT. I HAVE BEEN TALKING TO LAWMAKERS HERE. DEMOCRATIC LAWMAKERS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THIS BILL. THEY ARE WILLING TO VOTE FOR IT BUT THEY ARE NOT IN FULL VOTING. SUPPORT, TAKE A LISTEN>>. I WILL SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE OUR FAMILIES HERE NEED TO HAVE IMMEDIATE RELIEF. IT'S LIKE PUTTING A BAND-AID ON A HEMORRHAGING WOUND. IT'S NOT ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE THAT AN EMBRYO IS NOT A CHILD >>. THAT'S THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION HERE IS: WILL THIS BILL BE ENOUGH, GIVEN THAT THE RULING AND THE STATE'S CONSTITUTION STILL HAS THIS CLAUSE IN IT, SAYING THAT EMBRYOS ARE PEOPLE HALLE >>. -- BURNS LIVE FOR US. THANK YOU SO MUCH. >>>. TONIGHT, OFFICIALS ARE SHOWING MORE ABOUT THAT HUGE FIRE IN MICHIGAN, THE ONE THAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE ON THE SCREEN. I WANT TO SHOW YOU THE EXPLOSIONS COMING OUT OF THIS PLANT, LITERALLY SHAKING HOUSES NEARBY. DO YOU SEE THAT HORRIFIC RAINING DOWN DEBRIS ON MONDAY? POLICE SAY THIS WAS ALL HAPPENING AT A VAPE DISTRIBUTION FACILITY THAT HAD BEEN ILLEGALLY STORING COMBUSTIBLE GAS CANISTERS, ONE OF WHICH APPARENTLY HIT 19- YEAR-OLD TURNER SALTER, EVENTUALLY KILLING HIM. OFFICIALS: A SALTER WAS IN A NEARBY CAR WASH WATCHING ALL THIS, ALL OF THE COMMOTION AS IT HAPPEN. NOW CREWS ARE THERE AT THE SCENE. YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THE AFTERMATH HERE. CLEANUP IS. OFFICIALS WARN THAT SOME OF THE DEBRIS COULD STILL BE DANGEROUS AND STILL POTENTIALLY BE EXPLOSIVE. THE QUESTION WE ARE TRYING TO ANSWER. WHAT CAME FIRST AT THIS PLANT? WAS IT THE FIRE OR THE EXPLOSION EXPLOSION? WE HAVE SHOWN THE PICTURES AND YOU CAN'T OVERSTATE HOW DRAMATIC THIS WAS. SOME OF THESE EXPLOSIVE CANISTERS WENT FLYING SOMETHING LIKE A MILE. IT'S STILL DANGEROUS. YOUR THIS SITE TALK TO US ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED AND WHERE THE INVESTIGATION GOES NOW. >>. Reporter. THE LATEST INFORMATION IS UP TO TWO MILES AWAY. THAT'S HOW FAR THAT DEBRIS WAS SCATTERED IN. THE WARNING FOR RESIDENTS HERE IS: IF YOU SEE ONE OF THOSE CANISTERS, DON'T TOUCH IT, DON'TPICK IT UP, BECAUSE IT COULD STILL EXPLODE. WE HAVE SEEN SMALL FIRES RE- EMERGING HERE THROUGHOUT THE DAY. INVESTIGATORS ARE HOPING THAT THEY CAN GET ON THIS SITE FULLY SO THEY CAN START THE NEXT STEP TO PINPOINT. WHAT HAPPENED? WHAT LED TO THAT SERIES OF EXPLOSIONS? WE TALKED ABOUT THOSE FLYING CANISTERS IN THE FLYING DEBRIS. THAT IS WHAT HIT THE 19-YEAR OLD TURNER IN HIS HEAD. HIS FUNERAL IS PLANNED FOR THIS FRIDAY. HE WILL BE REMEMBERED AS A TEEN WHO WAS KIND AND SERVED AT HIS CHURCH, MEANWHILE. PEOPLE BACK HERE IN THE COMMUNITY ARE STILL TALKING ABOUT WHAT THEY SAW. >>. WHAT I FELT WAS THE WHOLE WORLD, THE EARTHSHAKING WORLD. THE EARTHSHAKING IT WAS PRETTY, BAD AND SCARY. IT NEVER STOPPED. IT NEVER STOPPED. THE EXPLOSIONS NEVER STOPPED. >>. Reporter. WHAT WAS EXPLODING? HALLE? THOSE CANISTERS WHICH CONTAINED BUTANE, AT LEAST HALF REMAINED AFTER. THE BUSINESS OWNERS HERE HAD JUST RECEIVED RECENTLY A SHIPMENT, A SEMI LOAD. ALSO, INSIDE OF A BACK ROOM, ACCORDING TO CITY OFFICIALS, WAS A PALLET OF NITROUS OXIDE ALONG WITH LIGHTER FLUID. AUTHORITIES TELLING US THIS WHILE IT'S GONE NOW. BUT THE BUILDING THAT WAS HERE BEFORE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A RETAIL OPERATION. HALLE >>. ADRIAN LIVE IN MICHIGAN, THANK YOU. >>>. OUT OF NEW MEXICO, JURORS ARE NOW DELIBERATING THE REST SHOOTING CASE. AFTER, PROSECUTORS TOLD THEM FILMING WAS GAME OF RUSSIAN ROULETTE. EVERY TIME AN ACTOR HAD A GUN, LISTEN>>. I'M NOT TELLING YOU THAT HANNIGAN TERRACE INTENDED TO BRING LIVE ROUNDS ONSET, BUT I'M TELLING YOU SHE WAS NEGLIGENT, SHE WAS CARELESS, SHE WAS THOUGHTLESS >>. IT HAS BEEN A DRAMATIC TRIAL AND AN EMOTIONAL TRIAL. WE ARE NOW OFFICIALLY ON VERDICT WATCH TONIGHT CENTERED AROUND THE WOMAN. YOU SEE HER HANNIGAN TERRACE READ. THIS IS HER IN COURT TODAY. SHE'S THE ONE WHO LOADED THE GUN THAT WENT OFF IN ALEC BALDWIN TAN ON OCTOBER 21st 2021, WHICH LED TO THE DEATH OF HELENA HUTCHINS. NOW IT'S UP TO THE JURY TO DECIDE IF YOU, TERRACE READ, WAS TO BLAME FOR NOT BEING MORE, TO BLAME FOR NOT BEING MORE CAREFUL IF YOU FIND HER GUILTY OF INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER, OF TAMPERING WITH EVIDENCE SHE COULD FACE YEARS IN PRISON. DAVID GRIFFIN IS COVERING THIS FROM SANTA FE, NEW MEXICO. WE TALK ABOUT THE PROSECUTION'S DEFENSES -- CLOSING ARGUMENTS. THE DEFENSE DRILL DOWN ON THE FACT THAT THE JURY HAS TO BE SURE THAT COULD TERRACE READ WAS RESPONSIBLE WITHOUT -- WITHOUT A REASONABLE DOUBT. HOW DO THEY THREAD THAT NEEDLE? THE PROSECUTOR HAS YET TO SHOW ANY DIRECT EVIDENCE OF HOW AND WHEN THOSE LIVE ROUNDS FOUND THEIR WAY ONSET. THEY BLAMED ACTOR ALEC BALDWIN FOR PULLING THE TRIGGER, STATING THAT THE SCENE, THAT SCRIPT SPECIFICALLY DID NOT CALL FOR HIM TO DRAW HIS WEAPON. THEY BLAMED THE SUPPLIER OF THAT AMMO AND THE INVESTIGATORS FOR NOT DOING A SEARCH WARRANT UNTIL A MONTH AFTER THE SHOOTING. THEY SAY THE SUPPLIER COULD HAVE THROWN AWAY EVIDENCE. AND THEY HAVE ALSO CITED MULTIPLE TIMES THAT OSHA REPORT THAT FOUND FAULT WITH THE PRODUCTION RUST, PRODUCTION AND MANAGEMENT FOR SEVERAL SAFETY FAILURES THROUGHOUT THAT ENTIRE FILMING SESSION. LISTEN >>. THE BUCK STOPS WITH PRODUCTION. AS IN ANY ORGANIZATION, IT STARTS AT THE TOP. YOU'VE GOT A CONVENIENT FALL PERSON, YET A CONVENIENT SCAPEGOAT. SHE MAY NOT BE THE ARMOR ON SOME DAYS- SHE'S A PROPS PERSON- BUT SHE IS CERTAINLY THE ARMOR WHEN EVERYTHING GOES BAD. >>. THE PROSECUTION ADDED: SHE WAS NOT THE FALL PERSON, SHE WAS THE PERSON WHO DID NOT DO HER JOB. SHE ALSO AGREED: YOU'RE RIGHT, HANNIGAN TERRACE. THREE DID NOT KNOW SHE WAS LOADING A LIVE ROUND. BECAUSE THE PROSECUTOR SAYS, HAD SHE KNOWN, SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN CHARGED WITH MURDER HALLE. >>. WHAT IS THE TIMELINE NOW? WHAT IS THE EXPECTATION FOR HOW QUICKLY WE MAY SEE A VERDICT FROM THE JURY? I KNOW THAT'S -- BUT WHAT IS YOUR SENSE? >> WE CAN LITERALLY HAVE A VERDICT BY TODAY. WE JUST GOT WORD THAT THE JURY HAS A QUESTION, SO NOT A VERDICT BUT THEY HAVE CALLED COUNSEL BACK IN. OUR PRODUCER HAS GONE INTO. TRY TO LISTEN IN. MAYBE WE CAN UPDATE YOU NEXT HOUR, MAYBE ON WHAT THAT QUESTION WAS AND MAYBE A SENSE OF HOW CLOSE THEY ARE TO COMING TO A VERDIC. >>. THAT'S SUPER INTERESTING. DANA GRIFFIN, THANK YOU FOR BEING THERE. WE WILL LOOK FOR THAT UPDATE COMING UP THE NEXT HOUR. >>> A LOT MORE TO GET TO, INCLUDING NEW BACKLASH AGAINST DORITOS. THAT IS HINTING BUT I BOYCOTT. >>> CROSS -- PLUS COST AMERICAN TAXPAYERS $1 MILLION A MONTH. THE FUTURE IS NOW. NEWS FOR THE GENERATION OF NOW. NEWS FOR THE GENERATION OF NOW IS NBC NEWS NOW. >>> ELON MUSK PUTTING TO BED SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT WHO HE IS SUPPORTING THE 2024 ELECTION, AND IT LOOKS LIKE NOBODY, AT LEAST WHEN IT COMES TO DOLLARS. IN A POST TODAY ON HIS PLATFORM X MUSK WROTE: JUST BE SUPER CLEAR: I'M NOT DONATING MONEY TO EITHER CANDIDATE FOR US PRESIDENT. KIND OF HAD TO SAY THIS AFTER. HE WAS SPOTTED THAT MAR-A-LAGO THIS PAST WEEKEND, ACCORDING TO THE NEW YORK TIMES GO. THE WHOLE THING RAISED A BUNCH OF QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER MUSK. I BE PUTTING HIS SUPPORT AND PERHAPS SOME OF HIS NEARLY $200 BILLION NET WORTH BEHIND THE FORMER PRESIDENT, WHO IS VERY MUCH LOOKING FORECAST NBC NEWS BUSINESS AND DATA CORRESPONDENT, BRIAN CHEUNG, IS JOINING US NOW. EVEN IF MUSK DOESN'T MAKE ANY DIRECT LOCATIONS, THE LANGUAGE IS INTERESTING IN HIS POST. THAT'S RIGHT. THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF THINGS IN CAMPAIGNS YOU CAN DONATE MONEY TO. STILL, HE HAS A LOT OF WAYS. IF STILL, HE HAS A LOT OF WAYS. IF YOU WANT TO COME TO PUT A FINGER ON THIS COME NOVEMBER >>, HE'S ONE OF THE WEALTHIEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD. IF HE SAYS HE'S NOT GOING TO COMMIT MONEY, THERE ARE CERTAINLY OTHER WAYS. HE COULD PUT HIS THUMB ON THE SCALE. THAT'S BECAUSE OF HIS MASSIVE INFLUENCE. HE OWNS THE X, FORMALLY KNOWN AS TWITTER PLATFORM, WITH 175 MILLION FOLLOWERS, EVEN OUTSIDE OF THE PUBLIC, FACING ASPECT OF WHAT MUSK SAYS AND DOES. HE HAS MANY CONNECTIONS TO OTHER VERY WEALTHY PEOPLE. THIS IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE. WE KNOW HE HAS A RELATIONSHIP WITH KANYE WEST, WHO ALSO HAS A LOT OF MONEY. MONEY COULD GO TO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AS A RESULT OF HIS CONNECTIONS, EVEN IF IT DOESN'T COME FROM MUSK DIRECTLY. ALSO AGAIN, HE HAS BEEN TWEETING. CLEARLY. IT'S NOT A SURPRISE TO ANYONE HE SUPPORTS SURPRISE TO ANYONE. HE SUPPORTS THIS CANDIDATE OVER BIDEN. FOR THAT REASON, HE CAN CONTINUE TO SAY THINGS AND IN SOME CASES ALSO WHILE PERHAPS MISS INFORMATION ABOUT CERTAIN SITUATIONS, AS HE HAS DONE BEFORE TO PUT A THUMB ON HIS >>. RECENT NBC NEWS INVESTIGATION ON THAT MUSK IS WRAPPED UP IN AT LEAST 11 DIFFERENT REGULATORY BATTLES WITH THE GOVERNMENT. HE IS, IN SOME WAYS, UNIQUELY INVESTED IN WHO ENDS UP IN THE WHITE HOUSE >>. YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. HE RUNS MANY, MANY BUSINESSES. A LOT OF THEM HAVE BEEN WRAPPED UP IN REGULATORY ISSUES, WHICH MUSK HAS BEEN VERY CLEAR IN SAYING: HOLD HIM BACK, HE MIGHT BE IN FAVOR OF A CANDIDATE THAT IS GOING TO PAIR SOME OF THOSE RELATIONS BACK, AS TRUMP DID DURING 2016.. I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT MUSK ISN'T NECESSARILY ON BOARD ENTIRELY WITH ALL POLICIES REMEMBER THAT DEAL BOOK CONVERSATION HEATSHIELD WITH EARLIER THIS YEAR, WHERE HE DIDN'T GO WHOLEHEARTEDLY BEHIND TRUMP >>. COULD YOU SEE YOURSELF VOTING FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN? IF IT'S A BIDEN TRUMP ELECTION, FOR EXAMPLE, >> I THINK I WILL NOT VOTE FOR BIDEN. >>. WILL YOU VOTE FOR TRUMP? >> I'M NOT SAYING I WILL BE. >>. I'M NOT SAYING I WILL BE TRUMP. BUT OH, THIS IS A DIFFICULT CHOICE HERE. >>. A DIFFICULT CHOICE HERE. LOOK, WE HAVE DONE BASED OFF WHAT HE SAID SINCE, THAT HE WOULD SUPPORT TRUMP OVER BIDEN. WOULD SUPPORT TRUMP OVER BIDEN BUT YOU HAVE TO SEE THAT THAT LONG PAUSE WAS A LONG PAUSE. WHEN IT COMES TO THE OTHER TYPES OF POLICIES, THAT CERTAINLY DOES INTO THE FOLD BUT ON A REGULATORY BASIS. CERTAINLY HE WOULD PROBABLY PREFER THE FORMER PRESIDENT TO BIDEN. >>. 30,000 FOOT VIEW HERE. X COULD BE POWERFUL COME NOVEMBER. COULD BE POWERFUL COME NOVEMBER IN WAYS THAT ARE PERHAPS USEFUL: TWO CANDIDATES IN CAMPAIGNS AND WAYZATA PERHAPS DANGEROUS. WHEN IT COMES TO SOMETHING YOU ALLUDED TO, WHICH IS MISINFORMATION >> YEAH, WE HAVE TO REMEMBER HE HAS USED THIS PLATFORM PULL IT -- OR POLITICAL REASONS BEFORE, EVEN IF MUSK ISN'T THROWING MONEY BEHIND THE SCENES. WE HAVE TO MEMBER THIS PLATFORM HAS HAD A LOT OF BIG CHANGES SINCE HE TOOK IT PRIVATE NOT LONG AGO. AND THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT. EVEN IF HE HIMSELF IS GOING TO, YOU KNOW, USE IT TO SAY WHATEVER HE WANTS TO SAY. WHETHER OR NOT, HE'S GOING TO POLICE. OTHER MISINFORMATION THAT COULD COME FROM THE OTHER MILLIONS OF USERS ON THE PLATFORM. HERE'S A STANCE: WHEN IT COMES TO X'S POLICY ON SPECIFICALLY VOTING IN ENGAGEMENTS HE SAYS: YOU MAY NOT USE X'S SERVICES FOR THE PURPOSES OF MANIPULATING OR INTERFERING IN THE ELECTIONS OR OTHER CERVICAL -- OTHER CIVIL PROCESSES. THAT MEANS MISLEADING PEOPLE ABOUT HOW AND WHERE TO VOTE OR INCITING VIOLENCE DURING AN ELECTION. THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT ARE CODIFIED IN THE POLICY BUT ENFORCING IT OUT -- HALLEY IS A ENFORCING IT OUT -- HALLEY IS A WHOLE DIFFERENT QUESTION THERE'S NO SHAREHOLDERS TO ANSWER TO. THAT'S AN OKAY PROCESS FOR THIS MASSIVE SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANY. >>. MUSK IS REALLY IN THE DRIVERS SEAT ON. THAT WENT TO A GREAT DEGREE. THANK YOU SO MUCH. >>>. THE FIVE THINGS ARE TEAM THINKS. YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT TONIGHT NUMBER ONE PROSECUTORS DROPPING CHARGES TODAY IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT HOTEL, CALIFORNIA TRIAL WE TOLD YOU ABOUT. THAT MEANS THE CHARGES ARE BASICALLY GONE. THIS IS A TRIAL. THAT ORDER, THAT EAGLES HITS WERE STOLEN. A NEW EMAIL RAISED QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FAIRNESS. NUMBER TWO: THE GOVERNOR WAS TO SELL THIS MEGA YACHT. SEIZED FROM A RUSSIAN OLIGARCH A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO, WHEN I WAS TRYING TO PRESSURE RUSSIA TO BACK OFF UKRAINE. THE YACHT COST THE MILLION DOLLARS TO MAINTAIN A MONTH. THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT'S DONE WITH THE COSTS. NUMBER THREE: STARBUCKS SAYS IT'S LAYING OFF 2000 PEOPLE. THIS BUSINESS IS TOUGH, THEY SAY. SOME CUSTOMERS HAVE BOYCOTTED THE CHANGE SINCE THE START OF THE ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR. STARBUCKS SAYS THEY DO NOT HAVE A POLITICAL AGENDA. NUMBER FOUR: TARGET IS ROLLING OUT A PAID MEMBERSHIP PROGRAM THAT KIND OF LIKE AMAZON PRIME. THIS ONE IS CALLED TARGET CIRCLE 360.. IT WILL COST YOU $99 A YEAR BASICALLY. IT'S FREE SAME-DAY DELIVERY FOR ORDERS OVER $35, DELIVERED IN AS LITTLE AS AN HOUR, PLUS FREE TWO-DAY SHIPPING. IT LAUNCHES IN APRIL. NUMBER FIVE: TAKE A LOOK AT THIS, A RARE GRAY WHALE SPOTTED NEAR NANTUCKET. IF YOU THINK OH, THAT'S PRETTY COOL RESEARCHERS THINKS THEIR HEADS EXPLODED. THEY COULD EVEN. TAKE A GOOD ONE SAID MY BRAIN COULDN'T PROCESS WHAT I WAS SEEING, BECAUSE THESE WELLS HAVE BEEN EXTINCT FROM THE ATLANTIC FOR MORE THAN TO HUNDRED YEARS. WHALING THE ISSUE THERE, THIS ONE WILL IS BACK, MAYBE BECAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE, WITH LESS SEA ICE IN THE WELLS WAY. AS THEY MAKE THEIR WAY TO THAT PART OF THE ATLANTIC PRETTY COOL >>>. THIS NEW BACKLASH NOW AFTER. DORITOS SAYS IT'S CUTTING TIES WITH THE TRANSGENDER INFLUENCER IN SPAIN. THERE WAS A VIDEO PROMOTING DORITOS SPAIN. THAT IS NOW OFF THE PAGE. THE PARTNERSHIP PROMPTING HASHTAG WHAT CAUGHT DORITOS TO POP UP ALL OF HER RIGHT WING CIRCLES ON X, FORMALLY KNOWN AS TWITTER. HUDSON HAS NOT COMMENTED, BUT IN THE STATEMENT DORITOS PARENT COMPANY, PEPSICO SAYS IT ENDED THE RELATIONSHIP BECAUSE OF CONTROVERSIAL, DELETED TWEETS. SHE MADE ADDING. YOU SEE IT HERE. WE STRONGLY CONDEMN WORDS OR ACTIONS THAT PROMOTES VIOLENCE OR SEXISM OF ANY KIND. IF SOME OF THIS IS SOUNDING FAMILIAR TO YOU, MAYBE BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY SHADES OF THAT CONSERVATIVE BACKLASH. BUD LIGHT FACED FOR PARTNERING WITH TRANS-INFLUENCER DYLAN MULVANEY. REMEMBER KID ROCK SHOOTING BEER CANS- EVERYBODY WATCHED THE BRAND FALL FROM ITS NUMBER ONE. PERCH OR BARRETT IS FOLLOWING THIS ONE FOR US, SAME. SAME BUT DIFFERENT AS IT SAME. SAME BUT DIFFERENT AS IT RELATES TO DORITOS AND BUD LIGHT. EXPLAIN THE CONTROVERSY HERE >>. THERE IS A LOT OF OVERLAP. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO BREAK DOWN THE BACKGROUNDS OF IT ALL. HUDSON IS A 24-YEAR-OLD ARTIST AND SINGER IN SPAIN. THE POSING QUESTION APPEARED ABOUT A DECADE AGO WANT TO PULL UP SOME OF THE REPORTING THAT WE HAVE. HUDSON WAS REPORTED TO HAVE TWEETED BACK IN 2015 ABOUT WANTING TO DO QUOTE DEPRAVED THINGS WITH A 12-YEAR-OLD GIRL. THAT'S ACCORDING -- ACCORDING TO ROLLING STONE. NBC NEWS HAS NOT SEEN THE ORIGINAL POST. THEY APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN REMOVED. HUDSON EXPRESSED REMORSE FOR THE STREETS BUT THAT POST, MADE IN 2021, IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE. ON HER PAGE THERE ARE MOTHERS -- OTHERS ONLINE. THE SAKE HUDSON HAS BEEN CRITICAL OF THE RIGHT WING IN SPAIN. SHE APPEARS TO SAY SHE ADVOCATES FOR THE ABOLITION TO DESTROY TRADITIONAL MONOGAMOUS NUCLEAR FAMILY. THAT'S ACCORDING TO A TRANSLATION OF THE VIDEO FROM SPANISH TO ENGLISH. A LOT OF CONTROVERSY SWIRLING AROUND THOSE PORTED COMMENTS TO READ A LAYING OUT EXACTLY HOW THEY FOUND OUT AND WHEN THEY FOUND OUT, AND IMMEDIATELY DISTANCING THEMSELVES FROM DISTANCING THEMSELVES FROM HUDSON ALDRICH. WHAT THEY SAY IS THOSE SPECIFIC COMMENTS. THEY ARE NOT EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE BUD LIGHT CONTROVERSY BUT CERTAINLY SOME OVERLAPPING SHADES. >>. LAURA BARRY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT. ONE APPRECIATE IT. >>>. A LOT MORE COMING UP ON THE SHOW, INCLUDING CHAOS IN HAITI, THE PRIME MINISTER OFF THE, THE PRIME MINISTER OFF THE ISLAND ON AMERICAN SOIL, THE NEW PUSH FROM ACROSS THE CARIBBEAN FOR HIM TO STEP. >>. WHAT DID THIS DEBATE CHANGE VIEW? >>. THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE IS ECONOMY. >> 2024, WHO IS YOUR CANDIDATE? >>. THE RACE IS ON. NOW THE COUNTDOWN HAS BEGUN. NEWS FOR THE GENERATION OF NOW IS NBC NEWS. NOW, NBC NEWS COVERS HUNDREDS OF STORIES EVERY DAY, BECAUSE IT CAN BE TOUGH TO READ OR WATCH OR LISTEN TO THE MALL. OUR BUREAU TEAMS HAVE DONE IT FOR YOU. THIS IS WHAT THEY TELL US IS GOING ON IN THEIR REGIONS. IN A STATEMENT WE CALL THE LOCAL, HUNDREDS OF NATIONAL GUARD MEMBERS ARE BEING DEPLOYED TO TRY TO CONTROL THE CRIME SURGE IN NEW YORK CITY'S SUBWAYS. THE MOVE IS PART OF THE GOVERNORS FIVE POINT SAFETY PLAN THAT INCLUDES THINGS LIKE MORE SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS. IT COMES AS THE NYPD IS GIVEN THE GO-AHEAD TOPICK UP BAD CHECKS OF THE WEST OF YOUR. THE FAMOUS SHOW AT THE BELLAGIO IN VEGAS HAS BEEN PAUSED THINGS TO A VERY RARE BIRD. THIS YELLOW BIRD -- BILLED LOON, SPOTTED IN THE WATER OUTSIDE THE HOTEL. EXPERTS CALL IT ONE OF THE 10 RAREST BIRDS THAT BREEZE ON US MAINLAND. LOOK AT THAT. IT'S GIVING DUCK VIBES TO ME, BUT IT'S A LOON, VERY RARE. THERE WERE CONCERNS THE BIRD, WE GET BOTHERED BY ALL OF THE FOUNTAINS GOING OUT THE LONGEST. --. THE LAS VEGAS REVIEW BUREAU SAYS THE LOON HAS BEEN SAFELY RELOCATED AS OF TODAY OF THE WESTMERE -- BUREAU K9 OFFICERS SPOTTING A MISSING TODDLER IN THE WIND STARTS FROM A LAKE. THE THREE-YEAR-OLD WANTED OFF NEAR HIS HOME MONDAY AFTERNOON. AFTER ABOUT AN HOUR OF SEARCHING THE CANINE, LET HIS HANDLER TOWARD THE LAKE. THE TODDLER ONLY HAD SOME SMALL SCRAPES AND THANKFULLY LOOK AT THAT LITTLE BABE. FOR THAT LITTLE THREE-YEAR-OLD IS EXPECTED TO BE JUST FINE THANK GOODNESS>>>. THE US IS URGING THE HAITIAN PRIME MINISTER TO SPEED UP HIS OWN RESIGNATION AND A POLITICAL TRANSITION TO DEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS AS THE COUNTRY GETS CLOSE TO THE BRINK OF A CIVIL WAR. IN THE LAST FEW HOURS, WE HAVE HEARD FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT SAYING: THEY ARE NOT PUSHING LISTEN TRAN05 >>. WE ARE NOT CALLING ON HIM OR PUSHING FOR HIM TO RESIGN, BUT WE ARE URGING HIM TO EXPEDITE THE TRANSITION TO AN EMPOWERED AND INCLUSIVE GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE THAT WILL MOVE WITH URGENCY TO HELP THE COUNTRY PREPARE FOR A MULTINATIONAL SECURITY SUPPORT MISSION TO ADDRESS THE SECURITY SITUATION AND PAVE THE WAY FOR FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS >>. THE ADMINISTRATION IS BEING CAREFUL. THE IMPORTANT INFORMATION WE ARE NOT PUSHING, WE ARE ENCOURAGING, HE SAID, BECAUSE A SECURITY CRISIS IN HAITI IS HITTING A BREAKING POINT. THE PRIMUS ARE NOW IN PUERTO RICO, NOT ABLE TO FLY BACK TO HAITI BECAUSE AIRPORT THERE HAS BEEN TARGETED. AS WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER THIS WEEK ON THIS SHOW. THIS IS GABE GUTIERREZ PICKING UP COVERAGE NOW OUT OF HAITI. THE US IS IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS VERY DELICATE POWER STRUGGLE HERE. I THINK YOU HEARD IT A LITTLE BIT WHEN WE PLAYED. FROM THE STATE DEPAMENT: WORDS MATTER IN DIPLOMACY. IN THIS INSTANCE, WORDS DEFINITELY MATTER >>. YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. WE JUST HEARD FROM WHAT THE STATE DEPARTMENT SAID ESSENTIALLY: THEY'RE NOT PRESSURING THE PRIME MINISTER TO RESIGN. THEY JUST WANT HIM TO LEAVE A LITTLE FASTER. YES, THEY ARE CHOOSING THEIR WORDS VERY, VERY CAREFULLY. HERE HERE IS SOME OF WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY HAD TO SAY: >> WE ARE DEFINITELY NOT PUSHING THE PRIME MINISTER TO RESIGN. THAT IS NOT WHAT WE ARE DOING. THAT IS NOT WHAT WE ARE DOING. WE HAVE UNDERSCORED THAT. NOW IS THE TIME TO FINALIZE A POLITICAL COURT TO HELP SET HAITI ON A PATH TO A BETTER FUTURE. THAT IS SOMETHING WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON FOR SOME TIME>>. YEAH, THE WHITE HOUSE WALKING THAT FINE LINE. AS YOU SAID, THIS ALL COMES AS PRIME MINISTER. THE PRIME MINISTER IS NOW IN PUERTO RICO. THE WHITE HOUSE ALSO SAYING THAT THEY ARE NOT HELPING THE PRIME MINISTER AT THIS POINT UNCLEAR, WHEN HE PLANS TO RETURN TO HAITI. HE CAME TO POWER BACK IN 2021, FOLLOWING THE ASSASSINATION OF THE COUNTRY'S PRESIDENT. THIS IS A DEFINITE ESCALATION. AS YOU YOU HAVE REPORTED OVER THE WEEKEND, THERE WAS A PRISON BREAK IN THAT COUNTRY. HAITI IS SLIDING FURTHER AND FURTHER INTO CHAOS. AT THIS POINT, LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT CHAOS. WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE ISSUES WITH THAT AIRPORT GETTING TARGETED. IT'S AN AIRPORT- I THINK IT'S THE SAME ONE YOU VISITED WHEN YOU WENT TO HAITI NOT LONG AGO. I THINK IT WAS WITHIN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. THE CONCERN IS TIMING. IF THE SECURITY SITUATION KEEPS GETTING WORSE RIGHT, IF THESE ATTACKS KEEP ON HAPPENING, THE SCOPE OF WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE, WHAT THE US CAN DO, GETS MORE AND MORE NARROW >>. YEAH, EXACTLY, THE OPTIONS ARE LIMITED HERE. LOOK, THE US HAS IN SOME WAY, SHAPE OR ANOTHER, BEEN INVOLVED WITH HAITI FOR A LONG TIME, EVEN IN THE 90s, FOLLOWING THE MILITARY COUP, THE US HAVING TO GET INVOLVED THERE WITH MULTINATIONAL FORCE. NOW THE QUESTION BECOMES: WHAT OPTIONS DOES THE US HAVE? THE WHITE HOUSE HAS BEEN VERY INSISTENT THAT THEY WILL NOT SEND AMERICAN BOOTS ON THE GROUND TO HAITI. BUT NOW THIS MULTINATIONAL SECURITY FORCE LED BY KENYA- WHEN WILL THAT TAKE EFFECT? WHAT OPTIONS DOES THE US HAVE IF THE PRIME MINISTER DOES? NOT IF THE PRIME MINISTER DOES NOT WANT TO. YOU KNOW, GET OUT OF POWER. YES, A LOT OF QUESTIONS REMAINING AT THIS POINT. HALLE MAJOR QUESTION: RIGHT NOW FOR THE US: HOW MUCH DOES IT PLAN TO GET INVOLVED? AND WHEN WILL THESE GANGS, THESE ARMED GANGS IN HAITI THAT NOW CONTROL ABOUT 80%, ACTUALLY, OF PORT-au-PRINCE, WILL THEY ACCEPT ANYTHING IN THE FULL RESIGNATION OF THE PRIME MINISTER? >>. GABE GETER IS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BREAKING IT DOWN, FOR US CAN SEE YOU ARE IN FACT, SOAKING. WET I'M DEEPLY SORRY. WET I'M DEEPLY SORRY. I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT. >>>. TODAY, TSA IS ROLLING OUT SOMETHING THAT COULD CHANGE: THE FUTURE OF CHECKPOINTS AT THE AIRPORT, A SIX-MONTH PLAN. THAT IS KIND OF LIKE SELF CHECKOUT AT THE GROCERY STORE. IT'S ONLY VEGAS FOR NOW AND ONLY PEOPLE WITH PRE-CHECK FOR NOW. SINCE YOU KNOW, WE KNOW- THE ROUTINE IN BESTIES. TOM COSTELLO KNOWS THE ROUTINE AND TRIED OUT FOR HIMSELF: TAKE A LOOK>>. Reporter. COME UP TO THE CHECKPOINT, TAKE YOUR CARRY-ON, PUT IT IN THE BEEN. IF YOU'VE GOT ANY QUESTIONS, SIMPLY ASK THE TSA OFFICER ON- DEMAND>>. HI THERE, HOW MAY HELP YOU TODAY. >>. Reporter, SLIDE YOUR BEEN ON THE ROLLERS AND WALK RIGHT INTO THE FULL BODY SCANNER. PUT YOUR ARMS DOWN TO THE SIDE AND IT'S GOING TO LOOK FOR ANYTHING THAT SHOULDN'T BE THERE AND IT'S TELLING ME. I GOT TO COME BACK OUT. I HAVE A MICROPHONE OF COURSE THAT IT HAS DETECTED. I HAVE THE TRANSMITTER ON MY BELT AND SOMETHING. A LOT OF PEOPLE FORGET MY CELL PHONE. >> LOOK AT YOU. WHAT AN ACTIVE STAND UP TIME. WHAT COMES UP FOR ME IS: YOU KNOW YOU ARE AT THE GROCERY STORE DOING SELF CHECKOUT. IT'S A 50-50 SHOT. YOU MAKE IT THROUGH EASILY. SOMETHING GOES WRONG AND YOU HAVE TO HIT THE BUTTON. THIS IS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE HELPFUL. I'M A LITTLE SKEPTICAL. >> YES, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE TSA IS TRYING TOMORROW. FROM YOUR CHECKPOINT. EXPERIENCE, CHECKOUT, EXPERIENCE AT THE LOCAL GROCERY STORE, WHATEVER YOU USE, DO YOUR MEMBER HOW TO SCAN YOUR BANANAS. I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER THE CODE. >> THERE'S THE NUMBER AND THEN IT GETS AN ERROR. >> THERE'S YOUR APPLES, SHAMPOO, CHICKEN, WHATEVER. FOR THOSE PEOPLE THAT HAVE IT DOWN PAT, THE THINKING IS THE SAME THING MIGHT BE TRUE AT IT YET -- AT A TSA CHECKPOINT, IF YOU ARE A PRE-CHECK, YOU HAVE TO BE PRE-CHECK AND YOU FLY ALL THE TIME AND YOU KNOW HOW TO MAKE THIS MOVE. THIS MAY BE SOMETHING FOR YOU. YOU MAY BE ABLE TO MAKE THIS WORK. I ASKED THE TSA CHIEF DAVID KOSKI. ADMIRAL DAVID KOSKI. IS THIS SOMETHING THAT COULD ROLLOUT NATIONWIDE? MAYBE NOT SO FAST? HERE'S WHAT HE SAID: >> DON'T EXPECT THIS TO BE WIDELY ROLLED OUT AT EVERY AIRPORT, EVERY CHECKPOINT. >>. NO, I DON'T THINK SO. WE ARE VERY EARLY IN THE PROCESS. PART OF WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO IS FIGURE OUT WHAT WORKS, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME MAKING SURE WE CAN PROVIDE THE SECURITY WE PROVIDE. >>. 2.5 MILLION PEOPLE OF COURSE GOING THROUGH TSA CHECKPOINTS EVERYDAY. I GOT A LITTLE HEADLINE FOR YOU. IF YOU ARE GOING ON SPRING BREAK, BE WARNED. TSA SAYS IT'S GOING TO BE EVEN BIGGER THAN LASTER, WHICH WAS A RECORD. WE ALREADY SING PASSENGER VOLUMES UP 6% OVER LAST YEAR. >> YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY: TOM PACK, YOUR PATIENCE. HAVE YOU HEARD THAT ONE BEFORE? I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE HEARD THAT. >> I GOT A TRADEMARK ON THAT. >>. HERE'S A QUESTION RIGHT. THE REASON FOR TSA, THE REASON WE GO THROUGH THESE CHECKPOINTS, IS NOT TO ANNOY ALL OF US AND SLOW US DOWN. IT'S FOR SECURITY AND TO KEEP US SAFE ON THE PLANE. HOW THEY NAVIGATE THAT. HOW THEY NAVIGATE THAT. DO THEY THINK THIS CAN ACTUALLY? -- WE SEE THIS EVERY YEAR ALL THE CRAZY THINGS PEOPLE LEAVE AT CHECKPOINTS THAT ARE CONFISCATED SAFETY VERSUS SPEED. HOW TO THEY NAVIGATE THAT? >> IT'S UNDERSTOOD, THAT IT WAS STOOD UP UNDER -- AFTER 9/11 AND THE TRAGEDY OF 9/11.. AND THEY ARE STILL CONFISCATING RECORD NUMBERS OF GUNS EVERY YEAR AT CHECKPOINTS. THAT'S THE BIG QUESTION. RIGHT, CAN THIS STILL ACHIEVE EXPEDITION? CAN THEY MOVE PEOPLE THROUGH BUT AT THE SAME TIME, CAN YOU HAVE A SECURE CHECKPOINT? THERE IS ALSO THIS GOING ON HERE. THAT IS THIS CONCERN ABOUT WHERE WE ARE IN A COMPETITIVENESS IN TERMS OF OTHER COUNTRIES, AND HOW WELL THEY SCREEN PASSENGERS IS THE TRUTH IS THE US TRAVEL ASSOCIATION SAYS WE ARE NUMBER 17.. RANKING NUMBER 17.. IN TERMS OF OUR COMPETITIVENES, WHAT DO THEY BASE THAT ON? OKAY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, HOW GOOD IS THE AIRPORT? ARE THEY CRUMBLING CHECKPOINTS? >> IS THAT AN AVERAGE OF AIRPORTS? >> YA, NATIONWIDE THE COUNTRIES HAVE HIGHER SCORES. >> REAGAN IS PULLING UP THAT AVERAGE, BUT THERE'S ANOTHER AIRPORT PULLING IT DOWN. >> THAT WAS A LITTLE EDITORIAL ON YOUR PART. >> TO TRAVELERS LIKE IT? >> I THINK IT'S A LITTLE GLITCHY, MAYBE TOO MUCH TO ASK OF PASSENGERS. RIGHT NOW. >> ALL RIGHT, WE WILL SEE. >> IF YOU CAN'T REMEMBER YOUR BANANA CODE, BUT IF IT'S TESTED AND VEGAS WILL IT, STAY IN VEGAS, WE WILL SEE. >> LOOK AT YOU, COMPOSTELA, APPRECIATE YOU. SUPER INTERESTING. >>>. A LOT MORE TO COME ON. THE SHOW INCLUDING AS TOM AND I WERE TALKING. IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S A VERDICT IN THE REST TRIAL THAT WE TALKED ABOUT. AT THE TOP OF THE SHOW WE ARE GETTING DANA GRIFFITH BACK AND WE WILL TELL YOU IN IS CUT OFF>>. NEWS FOR THE GENERATION OF NOW IS NBC NEWS NOW, NOW >>> IN-DEPTH REPORTING. TONIGHT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NUCLEAR POWER AND AI. THOSE TWO WORDS TOGETHER. FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE MAY BE FEELING A LITTLE BIT SCARY, RIGHT NUKES AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. FOR OTHERS IT MAY BRING BACK FRIGHTENING MEMORIES OF DISASTERS LIKE CHERNOBYL OR THREE MILE ISLAND. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT NUCLEAR PLANS, A NEW GENERATION OF ENTREPRENEURS WANTS TO BUILD NEWER, SAFER PLAN, SECOND PART OF THE FUTURE OF AI. HERE IS TIM GORDON >> Reporter. THIS FROM OUTSIDE AND EASTERN IDAHO COULD SOON BE THE BIRTHPLACE OF A NEW NUCLEAR AGE. >> REPROCESSING AND RE FABRICATION OF TRAN05. >> A RESEARCH THE CITY WHERE THE US EXPERIENCING WITH A SAVER KIND OF NUCLEAR REACTOR. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PUT THEIR EARLY RESEARCH REACTORS OUT HERE BECAUSE IT'S FULL OF UNDERGROUND WATER. FRANKLY, THERE'S NO ONE OUT HERE. DECADES AFTER, THE PLANTS STOPPED RUNNING. A SILICON VALLEY COMPANY WANTS TO BUILD A NEW VERSION, A 15 MEGAWATT REACTOR: >> MAKING FUEL FOR OUR FRONTLINE. >>. Reporter. THE REACTOR WILL USE LIQUID METAL AS A COOLANT AND LEFT OVER NUCLEAR WASTE FROM THE GOVERNMENT AS FUEL. >>. THIS WILL COVER THE FUEL. >> YEAH, AND THEN WILL FABRICATED. >>. Reporter. THE COMPANY'S CEO HAS BEEN WORKING IN NUCLEAR SINCE HE WAS 16 AND ENVISIONS HIS REACTOR POWERING A TOWN OR A FACTORY. >>. FOR MOST OF MY LIFE, THERE HAS NOT BEEN A QUESTION ABOUT THE DEMAND FOR WHAT NUCLEAR ENERGY IS, WHICH IS RELIABLE, CLEAN AND AFFORDABLE- ALL WHAT PEOPLE APPEARED. >>. Reporter. JEFF BEZOS, BILL GATES AND A HOST OF FIRMS INVESTED IN SEVERAL NUCLEAR COMPANIES. >>. THERE'S A LONG HISTORY OF HUMANS AND MACHINES WORKING TOGETHER. >>. Reporter. THE OPEN AI. >>. Reporter. THE OPEN AI CEO IS SPEAKING OPENLY ABOUT REQUIRING HUGE AMOUNTS OF POWER FOR THE DATA CENTERS THAT MAKE AI POSSIBLE. >>. THIS IS LIKE A DESPERATE NEED FOR AS MUCH ENERGY AS WE CAN MANUFACTURE. >>. Reporter. THIS IS NOT AN UNREGULATED TECHNOLOGY LIKE AI. THIS IS NUCLEAR, WHERE THE WASTE FROM EVEN NEW REACTOR DESIGNS WILL REMAIN DANGEROUSLY RADIOACTIVE FOR CENTURIES. IN 2022, THE NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION SAID THEY HAD NOT PROVIDED ENOUGH SAFETY INFORMATION. THE COMPANY IS WORKING TO SATISFIED REGULATIONS. >>. YOU GOT NEW PHYSICS, YOU'VE GOT TO USE NEW MODELS AND DO ALL SORTS OF THINGS THAT ARE DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THEY USED TO. A LOT OF THINGS HE USED TO DO DON'T APPLY. INSURING THIS MEETS ADEQUATE SAFETY REQUIREMENTS >>. Reporter FOLKS SEEM PRETTY COMFORTABLE WITH THE IDEA. >> I THINK IT'S GREAT WE'VE HAD BEFORE. >>. AT THIS POINT YOU WOULD SAY YOU ARE PRETTY COMFORTABLE WITH THE NEW DEPARTMENT >> YEAH >>. Reporter ARGUE THAT NUCLEAR SOLVES THE PROBLEM FOR TECH CEOS, NOT FOR HUMANITY. >>. IF YOU WERE TO INTEGRATE LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS, GPT STYLE MODELS, INTO SEARCH ENGINES, IT'S GOING TO COST YOU KNOW FIVE TIMES AS MUCH ENVIRONMENTALLY AS STANDARD SOURCES. I WANT TO SEE INNOVATION IN THIS COUNTRY. I JUST WANT THE SCOPE OF INNOVATION TO BE DETERMINED BEYOND. YOU KNOW THE INCENTIVE STRUCTURES OF THESE GIANT COMPANIES. >>. WHAT WE DID IS JUST CUT BACK ON OUR ENERGY CONSUMPTION. I WE NEED MORE TO FEED OUR SOCIETY, MORE AND MORE AND MORE POWER >>. YEAH, I WILL INTO THAT TWO WAYS. WE HAVE ALMOST ALWAYS SEEN A DIRECT -- HIGH ENERGY IMPOTENCE. AND WE ARE STILL SO FAR AWAY FROM ELECTRIFYING VEHICLES AND THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY NEEDED AND THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY NEEDED TO DO THAT IS HUGE>>. Reporter. ON THE ONE HAND QUESTION HERE IS JUST LOGISTICAL RIGHT. IF WE ARE GOING TO ELECTRIFY EVERYTHING, FROM CARS TO KITCHEN RANGES, WE ARE GOING TO NEED VASTLY MORE POWER THAN WE CAN CURRENTLY PRODUCE. THIS ALSO RAISES A PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTION: RIGHT, WHOSE INTERESTS ARE WE SERVING BY GOING TO NUCLEAR? SERVING THE INTEREST OF COMPANIES THAT WANT TO BUILD AI PRODUCTS AND EV AND FIGURE OUT WAYS TO POWER THEM? OR ARE WE ACTUALLY SERVING HUMANITY'S INTEREST'S? ARE WE TRYING TO LIVE WITH MORE POWER, OR SHOULD WE BE TRYING TO LIVE WITH LESS HALLE? >>. IT SEES DIFFICULT AND REALLY INTENSE QUESTIONS. THANKS TO OUR GOOD FRIEND FOR ALL OF THAT AMAZING REPORTED. THAT DOES IT FOR THIS HOUR. WE WILL HAVE SPECIAL COVERAGE OF THE STATE OF THE UNION TOMORROW NIGHT, RIGHT HERE ON ABC NEWS. NOW, FIND IT. HOWEVER YOU ARE WATCHING >>>. PLUS, WHY? FAR RIGHT FIGURES, I MIGHT'VE TAKEN ON DORITOS WITH A PARTNERSHIP WITH A WITH A PARTNERSHIP WITH A TRANSGENDER INFLUENCER>>>. TONIGHT, THE LONGEST GENERAL ELECTION IN A GENERATION BEGINS WITH DONALD TRUMP, NOW THE PRESUMPTIVE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE SETTING UP A REMATCH WITH PRESIDENT BIDEN. WE HAVE NOT HAD THE MAJOR CANDIDATES LOCKED DOWN THIS EARLY SINCE MY SPACE HIT 1 MILLION USERS BACK IN 2004.. 244 DAYS UNTIL THE GENERAL ELECTION. AFTER 243 OF THEM, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO AVOID THE MOMENT- THE POLLS SHOW. MOST AMERICANS HAVE BEEN DREADING ELECTION DAY FEATURING FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP AND PRESIDENT BIDEN. MORE THAN HALF OF THE VOTERS SAY THEY DON'T WANT EITHER AS THEIR NOMINEE. TWO THIRDS SAY THEY WANT SOMEBODY. NEW 67%- THEY ARE NOT GETTING THAT. NIKKI HALEY TODAY DECIDED HER TIME IS UP. AFTER. SHE WON JUST ONE STATEMENT TO -- SUPER TUESDAY >>. IT IS NOW UP TO DONALD TRUMP TO EARN THE VOTES OF THOSE IN OUR PARTY AND BEYOND DID, NOT SUPPORT HIM. SUPPORT HIM. I HOPE HE DOES THAT. AT ITS BEST, POLITICS IS ABOUT BRINGING PEOPLE INTO YOUR CAUSE, NOT TURNING THEM AWAY. >>. THE FORMER PRESIDENT MOCKING HALEY AVON AS HE TRIES TO GET HIS SUPPORTERS BEHIND HIS TEAM. A DIRECTIVE TO FALL IN LINE IS THE LAST HOLDOUT. THAT IS, PARTIES ARE DOING JUST THAT, INCLUDING MITCH McCONNELL. HE SUMMED UP HIS ENDORSEMENT BY GUSHING EXUBERANTLY THAT MR TRUMP HAS THE ""REQUISITE SUPPORT OF REPUBLICAN VOTERS"". RESIGNATION TO THE REALITY PERHAPS THAT THIS IS DONALD TRUMP'S PARTY. PRESIDENT BIDEN HOPING TO PEEL. PRESIDENT BIDEN HOPING TO PEEL AWAY HALEY SUPPORTERS WHO FEEL. THERE IS NOT A PLACE FOR THEM IN THE MAGA MOVEMENT. EXIT POLLS OUT OF A FEW KEY STATES SHOW. THERE ARE HALEY VOTERS ARE NOT PROMISING TO BACK. DONALD TRUMP DOES THAT, MEAN THEY WILL GO FOR JOE BIDEN OR STAY HOME. I WANT TO START WITH VAUGHN HILLYARD, STEPS AWAY FROM MAR-A LAGO IN WEST PALM BEACH, FLORIDA. WE SHOWED THE POST. THE FORMER PRESIDENT PUT UP TAKING JABS AT NIKKI HALEY, SAYING SHE WAS TROUNCE EVENING, AS HE SAID. HEY SUPPORTERS, COME MY WAY. WILL THERE BE A SERIOUS ATTEMPT TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN, OR WILL THIS BE DONALD TRUMP SAYING: LET'S DO IT RATHER THAN AN OLIVE BRANCH >>. Reporter. WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH THIS HERE BEFORE. USUALLY IT IS THE POWER DYNAMICS AT PLAY, THAT OF LED PROMINENT REPUBLICANS TO COME BACK TO DONALD TRUMP. BACK TO DONALD TRUMP IF YOU -- HE WERE TO WIN THE PRESIDENCY, HE WOULD ALL BUT RUN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. NIKKI HALEY WAS CRITICAL EIGHT YEARS AGO OF DONALD TRUMP, WHEN HE WAS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT THE FIRST GO ROUND AND A COUPLE MONTHS LATER SHE BACKED HIS CAMPAIGN AND THEN BECAME THE UN AMBASSADOR UNDER HIS ADMINISTRATION. THE QUESTION HERE IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT. SHE WAS ACTUALLY RUNNING HER OWN CAMPAIGN AGAINST HIM. HERE THE QUESTION IS TO WHAT EXTENT DONALD TRUMP EVEN FEELS LIKE HE NEEDS TO APPEAL TO NIKKI HALEY DIRECTLY BECAUSE THE CAMPAIGN- THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN- FEELS THAT IN A BIDEN-TRUMP MATCHUP, MOST INDEPENDENT VOTERS WILL FALL TO TRUMP, REGARDLESS OF WHAT NIKKI HALEY DIRECTLY HAS TO SAY, WAS INTO A PART OF THE CONVERSATION WITH THE CO CAMPAIGN MANAGER FOR TRUMP. >> PEOPLE SHOULD NOT EXPECT A. >> PEOPLE SHOULD NOT EXPECT A BIG CHANGE IN TONE. BIG CHANGE IN TONE. >>. Reporter. IT'S WORKING FOR THIS CAMPAIGN. IT HAS BEEN ON THE GROUND FOR 17 MONTHS. SOME FOLKS OF SAID HE HAS TO APPEAL TO A GREATER SWATH OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND YOU CAN SAY TONE IT DOWN AND CHANGE HIS APPEAL DONALD TRUMP TO THE EXACT OPPOSITE. HE WAS INDICTED FOUR TIMES AND FOUND TO ENGAGE REPEATEDLY IN FINANCIAL FRAUD AND TO ARE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED. E JEAN CARROLL AND YET HE STILL. HANDILY WON THE REPUBLICAN. HANDILY WON THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION. >>. YOU TALK ABOUT THE LEGAL ISSUES THE FORMER PRESIDENT IS FACING. WE NOW HAVE LEARNED OF THE DATE. THE SUPREME COURT WILL HEAR ARGUMENT AND THAT REALLY IMPORTANT PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY CASE IS APRIL 25.. THE LEGAL AND POLITICAL CALENDARS MERGING, ESPECIALLY AFTER THE CITY MARCH, ESPECIALLY AFTER THE CITY MARCH 25 BEING THE START OF THE HUSH MONEY TRIAL >>. Reporter. THIS IS WHERE THE STAKES ARE DIFFERENT. THIS IS MORE THAN AN INDICTMENT. THIS IS A MATTER-OF- FACTLY GOING TO TRIAL. LET'S START WITH MARCH 25.. 19 DAYS AWAY, THIS LITTLE GRACE PERIOD BETWEEN WINNING THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION, THE PRESUMPTIVE NOMINEE, AND THEN HAVING TO SHOW UP IN A COURTROOM ANYWHERE FROM 3 TO 6 WEEKS IN NEW YORK CITY ON WEEKS IN NEW YORK CITY ON FELONY COUNTS, IS RAPIDLY APPROACHING FAST-FORWARD EMMA SLATER, APRIL 25,, THE HIGH-STAKES ORAL ARGUMENT. THE FRONT OF THE US SUPREME COURT ON WHETHER HE, WHEN IT COMES TO THE FEDERAL ELECTION INTERFERENCE CHARGES, HE FACES STEMMING FROM THE WASHINGTON DC INDICTMENT WHETHER HE WAS GRANTED PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY AND PROTECTED FROM HIS OFFICIAL CAPACITY WITHIN THE WHITE HOUSE DURING THAT TIME PERIOD. THE SUPREME COURT DECISION THAT WOULD COME SEVERAL WEEKS LATER WOULD HAVE HIGH-STAKES AND WHETHER THAT CRIMINAL TRIAL ACTUALLY EVER TAKES PLACE LET ALONE BEFORE THE NOVEMBER GENERAL ELECTION. >>. VAUGHN HILLYARD, THANK YOU. >>>. BREAKING NEWS AND ALIVE LOOK INSIDE THE COURTROOM FOR THE RUST TRIAL, THE ARMOR FOR THE MOVIE WE KNOW THAT JURORS HAVE REVERTED. I'M GOING TO ASK IF THIS IS ALIVE LOOK. I BELIEVE IT IS. THIS IS LIVE. YOU WERE LOOKING AT HANNAH GUTIERREZ-REED, AGAIN ALIVE LOOK IN COURT, AS SHE IS PREPARING TO HEAR THE. SHE IS PREPARING TO HEAR THE VERDICT IN THE CASE AGAINST HER PROSECUTORS IN CLOSING ARGUMENTS HAVE TOLD THE JURY THAT WHEN GUTIERREZ-REED WASN'T DOING HER JOB, FILMING WAS LIKE A GAME OF RUSSIAN ROULETTE. EVERY TIME AN ACTOR HAD A GUN WANT TO SEE IF WE HAVE AUDIO TO LISTEN INTO THE VERDICT. WE DO NOT HAVE AUDIO. WE DO NOT HAVE AUDIO. WE DO HAVE A PRODUCER IN COURT, I BELIEVE DANA GRIFFIN IS INCORPORATE. I HEAR SOME OF THE BACKGROUND NOISE. THEY MAY HAVE TURNED ON THE MICROPHONES. WE ARE GOING TO LISTEN IN REMEMBER WHAT SHE FACES. THIS IS AN ISSUE WHERE SHE IS ACCUSED. SHE LOADED THE GUN THAT WENT OFF IN THE HAND OF ALEC BALDWIN BACK IN OCTOBER 2021.. THAT LED TO THE DEATH OF THE CINEMATOGRAPHER FOR THE MOVIE, HALYNA HUTCHINS. IT IS NOW UP TO THE JURY TO DECIDE IF SHE IS GUILTY OR NOT, WITH INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER AND TAMPERING OF EVIDENCE. WE HAVE AUDIO NOW: >>. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY, HAVE YOU REACHED A VERDICT? >> YES. >>. LET ME SEE THE VERDICT. >> MOMENTS AWAY FROM THE. >> MOMENTS AWAY FROM THE VERDICT BEING READ. REMEMBER, THIS ONLY WENT TO THE JURY THIS AFTERNOON. THEY HAVE NOT HAVE A CASE FOR THAT LONG. WE JUST SAW CLOSING ARGUMENTS PRESENTED TODAY FROM BOTH THE PROSECUTION AND THE DEFENSE. THE DEFENSE HAS TRIED TO MAKE THE CASE ESSENTIALLY THAT HANNAH GUTIERREZ-REED WAS NOT THE ONE WHO WAS ULTIMATELY TO BLAME. LET'S LISTEN: >> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY, THROUGH THE FOUR PERSON. HAVE YOU REACHED A VERDICT? >> YES. >>. DO YOU WISH TO READ THE VERDICTS? >> SURE. >> OKAY, START WITH COUNT ONE. >>. -- WILL THE DEFENDANT PLEASE STAND? >>. WE FIND THE DEFENDANT HANNAH. WE FIND THE DEFENDANT HANNAH GUTIERREZ-REED GUILTY OF INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER, AS CHARGED IN COUNT ONE. WE FIND THE DEFENDANT HANNAH GUTIERREZ-REED NOT GUILTY OF GUTIERREZ-REED, NOT GUILTY OF TAMPERING WITH EVIDENCE, AS CHARGED IN COUNT TWO. >>. LET ME GET THOSE FORMS FROM YOU. I WILL DO WHAT'S CALLED: POLLING THE JURY. WHAT I NEED TO PUT ON THE RECORD IS THAT THIS IS YOUR INDIVIDUAL VERDICT. OKAY, OKAY, I WILL START WITH THE GENTLE MAN IN THE BACK. IS THIS YOUR VERDICT? >> YES >>. IS INTROVERTED >> YES >>. HANNAH GUTIERREZ-REED. THE ARMOR ON THE SET OF THE MOVIE RUST THE DAY THAT HALYNA HUTCHINS WAS KILLED BY A GUN GOING OFF ONSET, FOUND GUILTY OF INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER, NOT GUILTY OF TAMPERING WITH EVIDENCE. YOU SAW HER. WITH NO REACTION, VERY LITTLE REACTION AS THE COUNTS WERE READ. WANT TO BRING IN OUR NBC NEWS. WANT TO BRING IN OUR NBC NEWS. LEGAL ANALYST: HE, WE HAVE HANNAH GUTIERREZ-REED IN HER LATE 20s, AFTER TWO WEEKS NOW OF THIS TRIAL. ALEC BALDWIN GOES TO TRIAL LATER ON THIS YEAR. REMEMBER, THIS IS NOW SEPARATE. REMEMBER, THIS IS NOW SEPARATE WITH THE CASE ON BALDWIN. CAN YOU FIRST EXPLAINED THE DIFFERENCE IN THE CHARGES? WHY WOULD A JURY FIND HER GUILTY OF ONE CHARGE AND NOT THE OTHER. HELP US UNDERSTAND THAT >>. THAT IS THE ONE THAT MYSTIFIES ME THE MOST AND APPROVES THE ADAGE THAT YOU CAN NEVER GUESS WHAT A JURY WOULD DO IF ANYTHING I WOULD HAVE SAID TAMPERING WITH EVIDENCE WOULD HAVE BEEN THE SLAMDUNK AND INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER WHAT MIGHT'VE BEEN AN ACQUITTAL ALTHOUGH. THIS WAS THE STRONGER OF THE TWO CASES THE STATE HAD. AFTER, ALL THE CASE THEY HAD WAS THAT HANNAH GUTIERREZ-REED WAS SOMEBODY WITH RESPONSIBILITY FOR FIREARM SAFETY ONSET. NOW SHE SHARED THAT WITH OTHER PEOPLE. THE DEFENSE MEDICATION WAS OVERWORKED AND MADE TO DO TWO. OVERWORKED AND MADE TO DO TWO JOBS. I THINK THE STATE, WHEN THEY MADE THE INITIAL PROMISE THEY WOULD PROVE WHERE THE LIVE ROUNDS CAME FROM. IT SEEMS TO ME MOST OF THE PROOF WAS WELL WHERE ELSE COULD THEY HAVE COME FROM BUT HANNAH GUTIERREZ-REED BUT IT APPEARS THE JURY BELIEVED THE EVIDENCE BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT. THE WAY I SAW THIS CASE IS THAT EITHER AN ACQUITTAL OR CONVICTION IS GOOD NEWS FOR ALEC BALDWIN, FOR SEVERAL REASONS TO EXPLAIN THAT. >>. TO MATTER WHAT, ALEC BALDWIN GETS A FIRST LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE. THIS IS ONE OF PHEASANT THAT SEVERAL MISSTEPS BY THE STATE TRYING THESE DEFENDANT SEPARATELY, SEPARATELY. NOW, ALEC BALDWIN HAS PRETTY MUCH SEEN WITH THE STATE CASE IS FRANKLY. IF YOU'RE ALEC BALDWIN, YOU TAKE THIS CASE AGAINST HANNAH GUTIERREZ-REED AND THAT IS YOUR DEFENSE. HE IS POINTING THE FINGER AT SOMEBODY ELSE WHO IS RESPONSIBLE. THEY WILL PUT HANNAH GUTIERREZ REED ON TRIAL. THE DEFENSE FOR ALEC BALDWIN. NOW THEY HAVE THE BENEFIT OF DOING THAT FOR THEM, JUST BEFORE ALEX BALDWIN'AS TRIAL. ALEX BALDWIN'AS TRIAL- HE CAN VOICE THE BLAME ON HER. AN ACQUITTAL WOULD ALSO BE GOOD, BECAUSE IT SHOWS THE STATE CASE IS NOT STRONG AND IT IS THEIR STRONGEST CASE AGAINST THE ARMOR >>. I BELIEVE SHE WOULD FACE UP TO 18 MONTHS BEHIND BARS IF, IN FACT, THE JUDGE FOLLOWS THE SENTENCING GUIDELINES WHICH HAPPENS DOWN THE ROAD. IS THIS APPEALABLE? IS HER TEAM EXPECTED TO POTENTIALLY APPEAL? >>. YES, EVERY CONVICTION IS APPEALED. THE RULES ARE SLIGHTLY. THE RULES ARE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FROM STATE TO STATE AND THE FEDERAL SYSTEM, BUT IN TERMS OF THE TIME TO DO IT. BUT THAT IS THE RULE. YOU GET AN AUTOMATIC APPEAL TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS. APPEALS BEYOND THAT ARE DISCRETIONARY. THERE WILL BE AN APPEAL. THIS CASE WILL BE APPEALED. THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT. THEY MAY HAVE SOME LEGAL ISSUES ON APPEAL, BUT IT IS ALWAYS A HOLLOW PROMISE THAT THE APPEAL WILL COME STATISTICALLY. THE ODDS ARE SO SLIM ON APPEAL. ODDS ARE SO SLIM ON APPEAL IN ANY CASE, WHETHER IT IS A HIGH RISK CASE, LIKE I THINK THIS IS, OR JUST YOUR RUN-OF-THE- MILL CASE. WE HAVE NEVER HEARD OF AN APPEAL AFTER COMMISSION. REALLY ISN'T MUCH OF AN REALLY ISN'T MUCH OF AN ASSURANCE >>. WHAT HAPPENS NOW? WE JUST SAW THE SHOT. THERE IS A MOTION IN COURT IS NOT CLEAR WHO THE FOLKS ARE IN THE BACK RIGHT. NOW WE WILL GET TO OUR PRODUCER WHO IS IN COURT ONCE THEY LEAVE THE ROOM, THIS SHE IMMEDIATELY GET REMANDED TO CUSTODY. HERE. IS THAT WHAT IS HAPPENING? >>. TYPICALLY, WHETHER OR NOT, A DEFENDANT GETS REMANDED IMMEDIATELY AFTER HE CONVICTION IS REALLY NOT RELATED TO WHAT THE SENTENCE WILL BE. IF YOU LOOK AT THE GRAVITY OF THE CRIME, USUALLY, THAT IS A FUNCTION OF: HAS SHE BEEN OUT PRIOR TO THE VERDICT AND HAS SHE DONE WELL ON PRETRIAL RELEASE OFTEN, YOU CAN REMAIN OUT HOWEVER. SOMETIMES THE DA WILL ASK FOR REMAND AFTER A CONVICTION IN A CASE WHERE, FOR EXAMPLE, YOU HAVE AN INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER. THE INTERESTING THING HERE IS THAT THE REMAND ITSELF IS NOT NECESSARILY RELATED TO HER SENTENCING BUT THE SENTENCE HE -- SENTENCING WILL NOT LIKELY HAPPEN FOR SOME TIME. THEY HAVE TO PUT TOGETHER A. THEY HAVE TO PUT TOGETHER A PRESENTENCE REPORT >>. IT LOOKS LIKE. SHE WAS COMFORTED BRIEFLY, SHE IS NOW EXITING THE COURTROOM. WE ARE NOW LOOKING AHEAD TO THE TRIAL OF ALEC BALDWIN, WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO START IN JULY. LOTS OF DEVELOPMENTS IN BREAKING NEWS ON THAT FRONT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR WALKING US THROUGH IT RIGHT HERE ON NBC NEWS NOW >>>. LET'S GO BACK TO WASHINGTON. WE'RE LOOKING AHEAD TO ANOTHER BIG MOMENT IN POLITICS, NOT JUST THE START OF THE GENERAL ELECTION BUT PRESIDENT BIDEN GETTING READY TO MAKE WHAT IS BASICALLY A RESPONSE, A REBUTTAL TO DONALD TRUMP'S SWEEP ON SUPER TUESDAY. LOOK AT THIS GRAPHIC: THESE ARE THE TOP 100 MOST VIEWED BROADCASTS OF LAST YEAR. LOOK AT ALL THOSE: FOOTBALLS, SPORTS, PRO SPORTS, COLLEGE SPORTS- THERE ARE A COUPLE OF EXCEPTIONS, LIKE THE OSCARS, THE THANKSGIVING DAY PARADE AND THE AMERICAN FLAG. IS THE STATE OF THE UNION. A LOT OF PEOPLE WATCH. IT IS STILL A BIG MOMENT FOR PRESIDENT BY THE. THE REPORT IS THAT THE PRESIDENT KNOWS THAT. THE QUESTION IS: WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON? EXPECT TO HEAR ABOUT THE COST OF DRUGS, IMMIGRATION AND THE BORDER AND THE ISRAEL-HAMAS MORE? ALL OF IT IS WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE SEES AS A LEAD UP TO A FULL ON FLOOD, THE ZONE MOMENT FOR HIS MESSAGE. LET'S PICK UP ON ONE OF THOSE- LET'S PICK UP ON ONE OF THOSE TOPICS: THE ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR. THE PRESIDENT HAS HIS OPPOSITION TO HIS HANDLING OF THAT WAR, EVEN INSIDE HIS OWN PARTY. WE SAW THAT WITH THAT UNCOMMITTED PROTEST PUSH IN MICHIGAN TO A LESSER DEGREE IN MINNESOTA. IT IS ENTIRELY POSSIBLE, IF THERE IS ANY REACTION FROM THE CHAMBER TOMORROW NIGHT, IT MAY NOT JUST COME FROM THE RIGHT BUT POSSIBLY EVEN HIS LEFT >>. Reporter. IT IS POSSIBLE. CERTAINLY. THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE PRESIDENT'AS TEAM ARE PREPARING FOR THAT. LAWMAKERS CAN INVITE GUESTS TO SIT IN THE GALLERY. THE ARE TYPICALLY NOT SEEN ON CAMERA BUT THEY ARE THERE. EACH LAWMAKER GETS TO INVITE ONE PERSON. ONE PERSON WE CERTAINLY SEEM WHEN THE FIRST LADY HAS GUESTS AND SO FORTH. YOU GET A SENSE OF THAT. THE IT IS POSSIBLE. THERE WILL BE THOSE WHO VOICE THEIR CONCERNS ON THE LEFT, ON THE RIGHT, FOR DIFFERENT REASONS, AND SO PART OF WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE IS DONE IS: TRY TO THINK THROUGH WAYS. HE CAN RESPOND TO THAT IN REAL TIME. THEY BELIEVE LAST YEAR, WHEN THERE WAS CALLING OUT FROM LAWMAKERS ABOUT ISSUES, THAT HE LAWMAKERS ABOUT ISSUES THAT HE WAS ABLE TO REACT. SHOW, AGILITY SHOW- HE WAS IN COMMAND OF THE ROOM. THAT WORKED WELL FOR THE PRESIDENT IN THE EYES OF HIS ADVISORS AND TEAM. THEY ARE PREPARING FOR THAT POTENTIAL, KNOWING THAT IN JUST ONE YEAR THE WORLD HAS CHANGED SO DRAMATICALLY WITH GOD, THE ONGOING CONCERNS ABOUT UKRAINE AND ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT MAKE ESTATE OF YOU, THE UNION, SUCH A BIG OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PRESIDENT >>. THERE'S ALSO. THIS PIECE, MR TRUMP HAS A CLEAR PATH WITH NIKKI HALEY OUT. THERE IS ALSO, AND HE WAS NOT A MAJOR FORCE IN THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY BUT HE EXISTED. CONGRESSMAN DEAN PHILLIPS DROPPING OUT OF THE RACE AGAINST PRESIDENT BIDEN. WE'RE JUST LEARNING THE PHONE CALL BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND THE CONGRESSMAN. THE CONGRESSMAN TRUCK. HE CALLED HIM. THIS IS A KIND OF THING YOU WOULD TYPICALLY SEE. IT IS A DIFFERENT APPROACH THAN FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP IS TAKING, WITH NIKKI HALEY DROPPING OUT OF THE RACE. ALTHOUGH, DEAN PHILLIPS IS NOT A BIG PRESENCE, HE WAS PART OF THAT VOICE OF CRITICISM WITHIN THE PARTY. THAT IS A CONCERN FOR THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN, THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN. THEY WANT ALL THE DISPARATE PARTS OF THE TEAM TO BE ROWING IN THE SAME DIRECTION. THERE WAS A PHONE CALL, AN OUTREACH TO SAY: JOIN US, WORK WITH US, WITH US. THAT IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING IN HIS HOME STATE OF MINNESOTA. IT IS A BIG MIDWEST BATTLEGROUND. THAT WILL BE IMPORTANT. AND SO, PRESIDENT BIDEN WHETHER. IT IS NIKKI HALEY TODAY, WERE HE PRAISED HER BRAVERY AND COURAGE RUNNING IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY AND ALSO SPOKE TO HER SUPPORTERS SAYING TO BE OPEN TO POTENTIALLY VOTING FOR HIM EVEN, THOUGH HE IS A DEMOCRAT AND NOT THE BASE FOR NIKKI HALEY. VOTERS DOING THAT AND OUTREACHING TO DEAN PHILLIPS SAYING HE IS DEAN PHILLIPS SAYING HE IS TRYING TO BUILD A COALITION TO WIN FOR A SECOND TIME. >>. KELLY O'DONNELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT. WILL SEE YOU AND THE REST OF THE TEAM TOMORROW NIGHT WITH SPECIAL COVERAGE OF THE STATE OF THE UNION, RIGHT HERE ON NBC NEWS NOW. >>>. IN JUST THE LAST HOUR, ACTUALLY THE LAST COUPLE OF MINUTES, YOU'VE SEEN ACTION OUT OF ALABAMA WHERE THE STATEHOUSE VOTED TO APPROVE A BILL TO PROTECT IVF CLINICS FROM LAWSUITS AND BUILT LIKELY TO GET TO THE GOVERNOR 'S DESK. YOU'RE NOW LOOKING AT LIGHT- YOU'RE NOW LOOKING AT LIGHT- PICTURES OF THE STATE SENATE WHERE THE GOVERNOR HAS SAID SHE WILL SIGN AS IF IT GETS TO HER. LAWMAKERS HAVE BEEN DEBATING THIS AFTER THAT CONTROVERSIAL RULING THAT SAID FROZEN EMBRYOS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED CHILDREN, WITH THE SAME RIGHTS AS CHILDREN. SOME LAWYERS HAVE SAID THE WAY THIS BILL IS CRAFTED DOESN'T DO ENOUGH. DR BIRX IS LIVE FROM MONTGOMERY, ALABAMA. THIS IS A PROCESS WE HAVE BEEN ANTICIPATING. THIS IS MOVING QUICKLY. NOW WE ARE BASICALLY IN THE FINAL PRO FORMA FINISH, PRO FORMA, FINISH. IT IS EXPECTED TO GET THROUGH THE HOUSE, THE SENATE, AND GET TO THE GOVERNOR. AND THEN WHAT? DO IVF CLINICS THEN RESTART PROCEDURES RIGHT AWAY? DO THE FAMILIES OF THE BEEN IN LIMBO GET SOME CLARITY? >>. Reporter. WE WERE JUST IN THE HOUSE CHAMBER SOME OF THE QUESTIONS BEING ASKED AS THIS WAS DEBATED ON THE FLOOR WERE FOCUSED ON: DOES THIS GIVE CONFIDENCE TO CLINICS PROVIDING IVF TREATMENT TO REOPEN AND RESTART THOSE PROCEDURES? THE ANSWER FROM THE FOLKS WHO HAVE BEEN CRAFTING THIS WAS YES, THEY SAY THEY HAVE TALKED TO DOCTORS AND THESE FACILITIES. THEY ALSO TALKED TO THE. THEY ALSO TALKED TO THE NUMEROUS ENTITIES THAT PROVIDE THE TOOLS AND RESOURCES IN ORDER TO TRANSPORT EMBRYOS, FOR EXAMPLE, AND ALL PARTS OF THE PROCESS. THEY FEEL CONFIDENT. THEY CAN NOW CONTINUE. THIS IS A BILL THAT WILL SOON BECOME LAW, POTENTIALLY AS BECOME LAW POTENTIALLY, AS SOON AS TONIGHT. THAT WILL GRANT BLANKET IMMUNITY TO ALL OF THOSE INVOLVED IN THE IVF PROCESS. HERE IS WHAT ONE OF THE FERTILITY DOCTORS I TALKED TO TOLD ME ABOUT WHAT THIS MEANS >>. WE HAVE WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS BILL TO PASS IN FACT, ANTICIPATING EMBRYO TRANSFERS AS SOON AS TOMORROW OR FRIDAY. WE KNOW THERE ARE LARGER QUESTIONS SURROUNDING THE SUPREME COURT RULING AND SOME UNCERTAINTIES ABOUT WHETHER THE SUPREME COURT WILL ACCEPT THIS BILL AS PART OF OUR LAW. >>. Reporter. THERE IS A BUT HERE. HERE, ONE OF THE LAWMAKERS I TALKED TO ESSENTIALLY CALL THIS A BAND AID ON A HEMORRHAGING WOUND. THIS IS A STOPGAP MEASURE THAT WILL ENSURE FAMILIES CAN RESTART THE PROCESS, BUT IT DOES NOT TOUCH THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE THAT CAME OUT OF THIS RULING, WHICH IS THAT EMBRYOS SHOULD BE TREATED AS CHILDREN. IT WAS EQUITY BASED ON A 2018 AMENDMENT TO THE ALABAMA STATE CONSTITUTION THAT SAYS EMBRYOS ARE PEOPLE. THAT IS AT THE HEART OF THE ISSUE. THAT HAS NOT BEEN TOUCHED HERE. THAT HAS NOT BEEN TOUCHED HERE. THERE ARE LAWMAKERS AND LAWYERS- A LOT OF FOLKS QUESTIONING WHETHER THIS STILL LEAVES THE DOOR OPEN TO LIABILITY AND A WHOLE OTHER CAN OF WORMS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY HARM FAMILIES AND MAKE THIS PROCESS MORE DIFFICULT. >>. DASHA BURNS, LIVE IN MONTGOMERY, WANTS TO UNTANGLE AND TALK TO. THANKS SO MUCH FOR KEEPING AN EYE ON ALL OF IT. >>>. WE'RE JUST LEARNING THAT ANOTHER SAILOR WAS ON A COMMERCIAL SHIP IS DEAD. THAT BRINGS THE TOTAL KILLED, NOW 23 AFTER AN ATTACK BY HOUTHI REBELS NEAR YEMEN. THIS SHOWS THE AFTERMATH. YOU CAN SEE THE DAMAGE BUT LOOKS LIKE SMOKE BILLOWING OFF THE SHIP. THIS MARKED THE FIRST TIME ANYBODY HAS BEEN KILLED IN THE HOUTHI ATTACKS. IS A TARGETED SHIPS IN THE RED SEA. IT HAPPENED ON A LIBERIAN OWNED SHIP WITH THE BARBADOS FLAG. IT RAISES THE POSSIBILITY THERE COULD BE ANOTHER ROUND OF STRIKES ON THE REBELS. HERE WE HAVE YET ANOTHER VERY DIFFICULT UPDATE. TONIGHT ANOTHER PERSON, ANOTHER SAILOR, KILLED. TALK AS FOR WHAT THE US RESPONSE CAN BE. >>. Reporter. WE ALSO LEARNED MOMENTS AGO THAT, IN FACT, SEVERAL OF THOSE INJURED CIVILIAN MARINERS ARE IN CRITICAL CONDITION. A VERY SERIOUS STRIKE HERE. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PICTURES OF THAT SHIP, IT IS ENORMOUS. THINK ABOUT HOW YOU CAN SEE THE SMOKE BILLOWING OUT AT THE END OF IT, JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF THE SCALE OF THE DESTRUCTION THAT THIS HOUTHI ANTIBALLISTIC MISSILE DID TO THIS CARGO SHIP. THIS HAPPENED EARLIER TODAY, ABOUT 60 MILES OFF OF THE COAST OF YEMEN, WHEN A MISSILE WAS FIRED FROM THE HOUTHI CONTROL- FIRED FROM THE HOUTHI CONTROL PART OF YEMEN. THEY HAVE BEEN ACTIVE IN THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS, FIRING FIVE ANTIBALLISTIC MISSILES AT SHIPS. THEY ACTUALLY HIT ANOTHER SHIP, ANOTHER MISSILE THAT WAS SHOT DOWN BUT TO OTHERS, LANDED JUST IN THE WATER, NOT IMPACTING ANYTHING. THEIR ACTIVITY HAS BEEN UP SIGNIFICANTLY. YOU MENTIONED A POSSIBLE RESPONSE. OFFICIALS SAY TONIGHT THEY ARE LOOKING AT POSSIBLE RESPONSES, WHAT WE HAVE SEEN RECENTLY IN OTHER HOUTHI ATTACKS WHEN THEY HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL. WE SEE THAT HE WAS A BRITISH MILITARY COME TOGETHER TO CONDUCT STRIKES. THE REALITY IS THEY DO NOT SEEM TO BE DETERRING THE HOUTHIS FROM CONTINUING THESE ATTACKS. >>. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >>>. COMING UP HOW, ELON MUSK, LET ME GIVE YOU A HAND. â™ª, â™ª, â™ª, â™ª, â™ª, â™ª, â™ª â™ª. >>>. TONIGHT, OFFICIAL SHARING MORE ABOUT THE VICTIM OF THAT HUGE FIRE IN MICHIGAN, THE ONE YOU ARE SEEING HERE. THE EXPLOSION IS COMING OUT OF A PLANT, LITERALLY SHAKING HOUSES NEARBY AND RAINING DOWN DEBRIS POLICE, DESCRIBED AS A VAPE DISTRIBUTION FACILITY THAT ILLEGALLY STORED GAS CANISTERS, ONE OF WHICH HELD THAT HIT A 19- YEAR-OLD, KILLING HIM. HE WAS AT A CAR WASH NEARBY. HE WAS AT A CAR WASH NEARBY. MAYBE WATCHING THE COMMOTION. OFFICIALS HAVE WORN SOME OF THE DEBRIS SCATTERED AROUND COULD STILL BE POTENTIALLY EXPLOSIVE. THE BIG QUESTION THEY ARE TRY TO ANSWER IS WHAT CAME FIRST. TO ANSWER IS WHAT CAME FIRST- THE FIRE OR THE EXPLOSION? WE HAVE SHOWN THE PICTURES AND YOU CAN'T OVERSTATE HOW DRAMATIC THIS WAS. SOME OF THESE EXPLOSIVE CANISTERS WENT FLYING SOMETHING LIKE A MILE. IT IS STILL DANGEROUS NEAR THE SITE. TALK TO US ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED AND WHERE THE INVESTIGATION GOES DOWN. >>. Reporter. THE LATEST INFORMATION IS UP TO TWO MILES AWAY. THAT IS HOW FAR THE DEBRIS WAS SCATTERED. THE WARNING FROM RESIDENTS IS THAT IF YOU SEE A CANISTER, DON'T TOUCH IT, BECAUSE IT COULD TOUCH IT, BECAUSE IT COULD STILL EXPLODE. WE HAVE SEEN SMALL FIRES REEMERGING THROUGHOUT THE DAY. INVESTIGATORS HOPE THEY CAN FULLY GET ON THE SITE TO START THE NEXT STEP TO PINPOINT. WHAT HAPPENED? WHAT LED TO THAT SERIES OF EXPLOSIONS? YOU TALKED ABOUT THE FLYING CANISTERS AND DEBRIS. THAT IS CANISTERS AND DEBRIS. THAT IS WHAT HIT THE 19-YEAR-OLD IN HIS HEAD. HIS FUNERAL IS PLANNED FOR THIS FRIDAY. HE WILL BE REMEMBERED AS A TEEN WHO WAS KIND AND SERVED IN HIS CHURCH MEANWHILE. PEOPLE BACK HERE IN THE COMMUNITY ARE STILL TALKING ABOUT WHAT THEY SAW. >>. WHAT I FELT WAS THE WHOLE WORLD, THE EARTH, SHAKING. IT WAS PRETTY, BAD AND SCARY. IT NEVER STOPPED. IT NEVER STOPPED. THE EXPLOSIONS NEVER STOPPED. THE EXPLOSIONS NEVER STOPPED. >>. Reporter. WHAT WAS EXPLODIN HALLE? THOSE CANISTERS THAT CONTAINED BUTANE AT LEAST HALF REMAIN AFTER THE BUSINESS OWNERS RECENTLY. BUSINESS OWNERS RECENTLY RECEIVED A SHIPMENT. ALSO, INSIDE OF A BACK ROOM, ACCORDING TO CITY OFFICIALS, WAS A PALLET OF NITROUS OXIDE ALONG WITH LIGHTER FLUID AUTHORITIES TELLING US. THE BUILDING THAT WAS HERE BEFORE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A RETAIL OPERATION OPERATION >>>. NOW TO ELON MUSK PUTTING TO BED QUESTIONS ABOUT WHO WE SUPPORTING IN THE 2024 ELECTION, AT LEAST, WHEN IT COMES TO DOLLARS, THE ANSWER SEEMS TO BE NOBODY. SEEMS TO BE NOBODY. IN A POST TODAY, HE WROTE: I AM NOT DONATING MONEY TO EITHER CANDIDATE FOR US PRESIDENT. HE KIND OF HAD TO COME OUT AND SAY THIS AFTER HE WAS SPOTTED. SAY THIS AFTER HE WAS SPOTTED AT MAR-A-LAGO THIS PAST WEEKEND, MEETING WITH DONALD TRUMP AND A FEW REPUBLICAN DONORS- THE WHOLE THING- RAISING A BUNCH OF QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER ELON MUSK WAS PUTTING HIS SUPPORT, OR MAYBE SOME OF HIS NEARLY $200 BILLION NET WORTH, BEHIND FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP, WHO IS LOOKING FOR CASH BRIAN CHEUNG, JOINS US NOW WITH MORE, EVEN IF MUSK DOESN'T MAKE DIRECT DONATIONS. BY THE WAY, THE LANGUAGE IS INTERESTING. THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT AREN'T CAMPAIGNS YOU CAN DONATE MONEY TO STILL. HE HAS A LOT OF WAYS IF HE WANTS TO, TO PUT HIS FINGER ON THE SCALE >>. Reporter. IT IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE HE IS ONE OF THE WEALTHIEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD. THERE ARE CERTAINLY OTHER WAYS. HE COULD PUT HIS THUMB ON THE SCALE. THAT IS BECAUSE OF HIS MASSIVE INFLUENCE. HE OWNS THE X PLATFORM WITH 175 MILLION FOLLOWERS, EVEN OUTSIDE OF THE PUBLIC, FACING ASPECT OF WHAT MUSCAT DOES AND SAYS. IT IS ALSO BEHIND THE SCENES. HE HAS MANY CONNECTIONS TO OTHER VERY WEALTHY PEOPLE. WE KNOW HE HAS A RELATIONSHIP WITH KANYE WEST, WHO ALSO HAS A LOT OF MONEY. MONEY COULD GO INTO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AS A RESULT OF HIS CONNECTIONS. EVEN IF NOT FROM HIM DIRECTLY, HE HAS BEEN TWEETING CLEARLY. IT IS NOT A SURPRISE THAT HE SUPPORTS THIS CANDIDATE OVER BIDEN BIDEN. FOR THAT REASON HE CAN CONTINUE TO SAY THINGS AND PERHAPS MISINFORMATION, AS HE IS DONE BEFORE TO PUT HIS THUMB ON THE SCALE. >>. AN NBC INVESTIGATION SHOWS THAT HE HAS WRAPPED UP 11 DIFFERENT REGULATORY BATTLES WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. HE IS UNIQUELY INVESTED WITH WHO ENDS UP IN THE WHITE HOUSE >>. Reporter. ABSOLUTELY A LOT OF HIS BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN WRAPPED UP IN REGULATORY ISSUES WHICH MUSK HAS BEEN VERY CLEAR IN SAYING: HOLDS HIM BACK. HE MIGHT BE IN FAVOR OF A CANDIDATE WHO WILL PARE BACK REGULATIONS AS TRUMP DID. I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT MUSK ISN'T NECESSARILY ONBOARD ENTIRELY WITH ALL THE POLICIES. REMEMBER A CONFERENCE HE APPEARED EARLIER THIS YEAR WHERE HE DID NOT GO FULL THROATED BEHIND TRUMP. >>. COULD YOU SEE YOURSELF VOTING FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN? VOTING FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN? >>. I THINK I WOULD NOT VOTE FOR BIDEN. >>. YOU WOULD VOTE FOR >>. REPORTER >>. I AM NOT SAYING I WOULD VOTE FOR TRUMP. THIS IS DEFINITELY A DIFFICULT. THIS IS DEFINITELY A DIFFICULT CHOICE HERE. >>. Reporter. A DIFFICULT CHOICE WE HAVE KNOWN, BASED OFF OF WHAT HE IS SAID SINCE THEN, THAT HE WOULD SUPPORT TRUMP OVER BIDEN. WOULD SUPPORT TRUMP OVER BIDEN. THAT LONG PAUSE WAS LONG. WHEN IT COMES TO THE OTHER TYPES OF POLICIES THAT ENTERS THE FOLD ON A VAGUELY TORY BASIS, HE WOULD PROBABLY PREFER THE FORMER PRESIDENT TO BIDEN. >>. 30,000 FOOT VIEW X CAN BE INCREDIBLY POWERFUL COME NOVEMBER IN WAYS THAT ARE PERHAPS USEFUL TO CANDIDATES IN THE CAMPAIGNS, AND WAYS THAT RE PERHAPS DANGEROUS WHEN IT COMES TO MISINFORMATION, TO MISINFORMATION >>. Reporter. WE HAVE TO REMEMBER HE HAS USED THIS PLATFORM FOR POLITICAL REASONS BEFORE WHEN HE TRIED TO LAUNCH THE RON DeSANTIS CAMP A THAT DID NOT GO WELL WITH THE TECHNICAL ISSUES, EVEN IF HE IS NOT THROWING MONEY. WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THIS PLATFORM IS AT A LOT OF BIG CHANGES SINCE HE TOOK A PRIVATE. THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT, EVEN IF HE IS GOING TO USE IT TO SAY WHATEVER HE WANTS TO SAY, WHETHER OR NOT HE WILL POLICE, THE OTHER TYPES OF MISINFORMATION THAT COULD COME FROM THE OTHER MILLIONS OF USERS ON THE PLATFORM. HERE IS THE STANCE WHEN IT. HERE IS THE STANCE WHEN IT COMES TO THE X POLICY ON VOTING AND CIVIC ENGAGEMENT. IT SAYS: ""YOU MAY NOT USE SERVICES FOR THE PURPOSES OF BEING ABLATING OR INTERFERING IN ELECTIONS OR OTHER CIVIC PROCESSES"". THAT INCLUDE SUPPRESSING PRESTIDIGITATION LIST, LEADING PEOPLE ABOUT HOW AND WHERE TO VOTE, OR INCITING VIOLENCE DURING AN ELECTION. THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT ARE CODIFIED IN THE POLICY BUT ENFORCING THAT IS A WHOLE SEPARATE QUESTION. IT IS A PRIVATE COMPANY WITH NO SHAREHOLDERS TO ANSWER TO. IT IS VERY MUCH AN OPAQUE PROCESS. >>. MUSK IS REALLY IN THE DRIVER SEAT. ON THAT ONE, BRIAN CHEUNG, THANK YOU SO MUCH, MUCH >>>. LET'S GET TO THE FIVE THINGS WE THINK YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT TODAY POLICE. SAY EIGHT STUDENTS WERE SHOT TODAY NEAR A SEPTA BUS IN PHILLY. ONE SHOT MULTIPLE TIMES AND NOW IN CRITICAL CONDITION. OFFICIALS SAY THEY WERE WAITING FOR THE BUS WITH THREE PEOPLE, GOT OUT OF THE CAR AND STARTED FIRING POLICE AND SAID THEY'RE WORKING TO MAKE SURE THAT SOMEBODY IS HELD RESPONSIBLE >>>. FEDERAL PROSECUTOR SERGEY AMANDA, TEXAS, WITH TRYING TO SCAM THIS GUY. YOU NOT RECOGNIZE HIM? FORMER CONGRESSMAN GEORGE SANTOS AND THREE OTHER PEOPLE? THE FBI SAYS HE TOLD THESE PEOPLE THAT THIS PERSON COULD HELP, GET CRIMINAL CHARGES DROPPED BUT, SAYS THE SUSPECT ADMITTED IN AN INTERVIEW, HE NEEDED MONEY BACK TO PAY GAMBLING DEBTS>>>. PARALYMPICS OFFICIALS SAY SAYING ATHLETES FROM RUSSIA AND BELARUS WILL NOT GET TO MARCH IN THE OPENING CEREMONY IN PARIS THIS SUMMER. THAT IS EVEN STRICTER THAN THE OLYMPICS WHICH WILL LET THEM BE IN THE OPENING CEREMONY AS NEUTRAL ATHLETES WITHOUT THEIR COUNTRY FLAT BEFORE. -- BECAUSE OF THE WAR IN UKRAINE. >>>. DORITOS SAYS IT IS CUTTING TIES WITH THE TRANSGENDER INFLUENCER. A PARTNER WITH IN SPAIN IS PARKED A BIG BOYCOTT CAMPAIGN. ONLINE, IT IS STATEMENT. THE DORITOS PARENT COMPANY, PEPSICO, SAID IT WASN'T BECAUSE OF THE BOYCOTT BUT CONTROVERSIAL POSTS THE INFLUENCER HAD MADE. >>>. A NEW STUDY SAYS ANCIENT STONE TOOLS FOUND IN UKRAINE ARE MORE THAN 1 MILLION YEARS, ARE MORE THAN 1 MILLION YEARS OLD AND MAY BE, ACCORDING TO ARCHAEOLOGISTS, THE EARLIEST EVIDENCE OF HUMANS IN YOUR THEY THINK THEY MIGHT'VE BEEN USED AS PRIMITIVE KNIVES TO CUT MEAT. >>>. COMING UP? THE NEW WARNING FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT, THE PRESS EVERY SUNDAY ON NBC. >>> NEWS LIVES IN THE NOW. >>. LOOK AT THIS. >> LET'S BREAK DOWN WHAT WE KNOW >>. NEWS FOR THE GENERATION OF NOW IS NBC NEWS NOW. NOW IS NBC NEWS NOW >>>. NBC NEWS COVERS HUNDREDS OF INTERNATIONAL STORIES EVERY DAY BECAUSE IT CAN BE TOUGH TO READ OR WATCH OR LISTEN TO THEM. ALL OUR TEAMS AROUND THE WORLD HAVE DONE THAT. FOR YOU, HERE'S A LOOK AT WHAT THEY'RE WATCHING OUT OF MEXICO. LOOK AT THIS VIDEO OF A PICKUP TRUCK RAMMING INTO THE DOORS OF THE NATIONAL PALACE IN MEXICO CITY. TODAY IT IS WHERE THE PRESIDENT LIVES. THE GROUP SMASHED THE DOOR AND SEVERAL ENDED UP INSIDE THEIR DEMANDING ANSWERS FROM MORE THAN 40 STUDENTS WHO WENT MISSING MORE THAN A DECADE AGO. THERE ARE CALLS THAT THERE IS AN ALLEGED COVER. THE PRESIDENT SAID THE PLAN IS TO CREATE A PROVOCATION. >>>. POPE FRANCIS HAVING A TOUGH TIME CLIMBING THE STEPS BACK ONTO HIS POPE MOBILE TODAY. HE NEEDED A WHEELCHAIR. HE NEEDED A WHEELCHAIR. HE IS 87.. WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT HOW HE IS BEEN DEALING WITH THE FLU AND LINGERING HEALTH ISSUES. THE POPE ALSO HAD AN AIDE. READ HIS REMARKS, WHICH HE HAS DONE THE PAST FEW DAYS >>>. IN GERMANY IN NEW STUDY, OUT ON A MAN WHO GOT A COVID SHOT 200 PLUS TIMES. HE IS 62.. GUESS WHAT, AFTER ALL THE SHOTS, MULTIPLE HUNDREDS OF SHOTS, NO NEGATIVE HUNDREDS OF SHOTS, NO NEGATIVE HEALTH EFFECTS- IS IMMUNE RESPONSE. DO NOT GET ANY BETTER OR WORSE. A PROSECUTOR OPENED AN INVESTIGATION INTO NEVER GIVING OUT VACCINATION CARDS AND FRAUD, BUT NO CHARGES WERE FILED. TO BE CLEAR, RESEARCHERS SAY THEY DO NOT ENDORSE THE SO CALLED HYPER VACCINATION TO IMPROVE IMMUNITY. OTHER WORDS: DON'T TRY THAT AT HOME. >>>. THE STATE DEPARTMENT SAYING THAT AMERICA TO GET OUT OF HAITI AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF HOW DANGEROUS IT IS GETTING. THAT IS AS THE US GOVERNMENT URGES THE HAITIAN MINISTER TO SPEED UP HIS OWN RESIGNATION AND A TRANSITION TO DEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS, AS THE COUNTRY IS CLOSE TO THE BRINK OF THE CIVIL WAR. THE STATE DEPARTMENT SAYING A FEW HOURS AGO, THEY'RE NOT FEW HOURS AGO, THEY'RE NOT PUSHING >>. WE ARE NOT CALLING ON HIM, ARE PUSHING FOR HIM TO RESIGN, BUT WE ARE URGING HIM TO EXPEDITE THE TRANSITION TO AN EMPOWERED AND INCLUSIVE GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE THAT WILL MOVE WITH URGENCY TO HELP THE COUNTRY PREPARE FOR A MULTINATIONAL SUPPORT MISSION AND TO PAVE THE WAY FOR FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS >>. THE ADMINISTRATION IS TIPTOEING CAREFULLY. THE PRIME MINISTER, NOW ON AMERICAN SOIL IN PUERTO RICO, IS NOT ABLE TO FIGHT BACK BECAUSE THE AIRPORT IN HAITI IS TARGETED BY ASSAULT. GABE GUITERREZ JOINS US NOW. THE US IS IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS VERY DELICATE POWER STRUGGLE HERE. I THINK YOU HEARD IT A LITTLE BIT FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT. WORDS MATTER IN DIPLOMACY. IN THIS INSTANT, WORDS DEFINITELY MATTER TRUCK. THAT'S RIGHT. -- >>. Reporter, THAT'S RIGHT. THEY SAID: THEY'RE NOT PRESSURING THE PRIME MINISTER TO RESIGN. THEY JUST WANT HIM TO LEAVE A LITTLE FASTER. THEY ARE CHOOSING THEIR WORDS VERY CAREFULLY HERE. HERE IS SOME OF WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS ITINERARY HAD TO. HOUSE PRESS ITINERARY HAD TO SAY: >> WHERE DEADLY NOT PUSHING THE PRIME MINISTER TO RESIGN. THAT IS NOT HAT WE ARE DOING. WE HAVE UNDERSCORED THAT NOW IS THE TIME TO FINALIZE A POLITICAL ACCORD TO HELP SET HAITI ON THE PATH TO A BETTER FUTURE. THAT IS SOMETHING WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON SOME TIME. >>. Reporter. THE WHITE HOUSE WALKING THAT VERY FINE LINE. AS YOU SAID, THIS ALL COMES AS THE PRIME MINISTER IS NOW IN PUERTO RICO. THE WHITE HOUSE ALSO SAY: THEY'RE NOT HELPING THE PRIME MINISTER. AT THIS POINT, IT IS UNCLEAR WHEN HE PLANS TO RETURN TO HAITI. HE CAME TO POWER BACK IN 2021, FOLLOWING THE ASSASSINATION OF THE PRESIDENT. THIS IS THE ESCALATION. OVER THE WEEKEND, THERE WAS A PRISON BREAK IN THE COUNTRY. HAITI IS SLIDING FURTHER AND FURTHER INTO CHAOS AT THIS POINT >>. LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT CHAOS. WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE AIRPORT GETTING TARGETED. I THINK IT IS THE SAME ONE YOU VISITED WHEN HE WENT TO HAITI NOT TOO LONG AGO. THE CONCERN IS TIMING. IF THE SECURITY SITUATION KEEPS GETTING WORSE, IF THESE ATTACKS KEEP HAPPENING, THE SCOPE OF WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE, WHAT THE US COULD DO, GETS MORE AND MORE NARROW. >>. Reporter. EXACTLY, OPTIONS ARE LIMITED HERE. THE YOU HAS -- THE US HAS BEEN INVOLVED WITH HAITI EVEN SINCE THE 90s, FOLLOWING THE MILITARY COUP. THE US HAD TO GET INVOLVED THERE WITH A MULTINATIONAL FORCE. NOW THE QUESTIONS BECOME: WHAT OPTIONS THE US HAS? THE WHITE HOUSE HAS BEEN INSISTED. THEY WILL NOT SEND AMERICAN BOOTS ON THE GROUND TO HAITI BUT NOW THIS MULTINATIONAL SECURITY FORCE LED BY KENYA, WHEN WILL THAT TAKE EFFECT? WHAT OPTIONS DOES THE US HAVE IF THE PRIME MINISTER DOES NOT WANT TO GET OUT OF POWER? A LOT OF QUESTIONS REMAINING AT. A LOT OF QUESTIONS REMAINING AT THIS POINT BUT THE MAJOR QUESTION RIGHT NOW FOR THE US: HOW MUCH DOES IT PLAN TO GET INVOLVED? AND YOU KNOW WHEN WILL THESE KINGS? THESE ARE BEGINNINGS. IN HAITI, THE NOW CONTROL ABOUT 80% OF PORT-au-PRINCE. WILL THEY ACCEPT ANYTHING IN THE RESIGNATION OF THE PRIME MINISTER? >>> COMING UP A PLAN THAT. >>. IMPORTANT NEWS IS OUR ABOUT YOUR MONEY. >> MENTAL HEALTH- BIG PICTURE. WHY IS IT SO TOUGH RIGHT NOW? >> NEWS FOR THE GENERATION OF NOW IS NBC NEWS NOW. NOW IS NBC NEWS NOW. >>>. TODAY, TSA IS ROLLING OUT SOMETHING THAT COULD CHANGE: THE FUTURE OF CHECKPOINT AT THE AIRPORT. A SIX-MONTH PLAN. THAT IS KIND OF LIKE A SELF CHECKOUT AT THE GROCERY STORE. IT IS ONLY IN VEGAS FOR NOW AND ONLY FOR PEOPLE WITH PRE-CHECK FOR NOW. WE KNOW THE ROUTINE. TOM COSTELLO KNOWS THE ROUTINE. HE TRIED IT FOR HIMSELF. >> Reporter, YOU COME UP TO THE CHECKPOINT, TAKE YOUR CARRY-ON AND PUT IT IN. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, SIMPLY ASK THE OFFICER ON DEMAND. >> HOW MAY I HELP YOU TODAY? >> Reporter, SLIDE IT ONTO THE ROLLERS AND WALK RIGHT INTO THE SCANNER. PUT YOUR ARMS DOWN TO THE SIDE. IT LOOKS FOR ANYTHING THAT SHOULD NOT BE THERE. IT IS TELLING ME. I HAVE TO COME BACK OUT. I HAVE A MICROPHONE THAT IT HAS DETECTED OF COURSE. I HAVE THE TRANSMITTER AND SOMETHING. A LOT OF PEOPLE FORGET MY CELL PHONE. >> LOOK AT YOU. >> LOOK AT YOU. WHAT AN ACTIVE STAND UP YOU ARE SHOWING AND TELLING WILL COMES UP FOR ME. IS YOU KNOW YOU ARE AT THE GROCERY STORE DOING SELF CHECKOUT- 50/50 SHOT. YOU DON'T MAKE IT THROUGH EASILY. SOMETHING GOES WRONG. IS THIS GOING TO E HELPFUL? I AM A LITTLE SKEPTICAL. >>. Reporter. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THE TSA IS TRYING TO MODEL FROM THE OLD CHECKOUT EXPERIENCE AT THE LOCAL GROCERY STORE. DO YOU REMEMBER HOW TO SCAN YOUR BANANAS? I CAN NEVER REMEMBER THE CODE. >> IT SAYS ERROR. >>. Reporter. NOW, FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE IT DOWN, PAT THE THINKING IS THE SAME THING MIGHT BE TRUE IN THE TSA CHECKPOINT. IF YOU ARE PRE-CHECK, IF YOU FLY ALL THE TIME AND KNOW HOW TO MAKE THIS MOVE, THIS MAY BE FOR YOU. YOU MAY BE ABLE TO MAKE THIS WORK. I ASKED THE TSA CHIEF: IS THIS SOMETHING THEY CAN ROLLOUT NATIONWIDE, MAYBE NOT SO FAST. >>. DON'T EXPECT THIS TO BE. >>. DON'T EXPECT THIS TO BE WIDELY ROLLED OUT. WE ARE VERY EARLY IN THE PROCESS. PART OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS FIGURE OUT WHAT WORKS: WILL FACILITATE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE, AT THE SAME TIME MAKING SURE TO PROVIDE THE SECURITY WE PROVIDE. >>. Reporter. 2.5 MILLION PEOPLE GOING THROUGH TSA CHECKPOINT EVERY DAY. A LITTLE HEADLINE FOR YOU. IF YOU ARE GOING ON SPRING BREAK, TSA SAYS IT WILL BE EVEN BIGGER THAN LAST YEAR, WHICH WAS A RECORD WERE ALL USING PASSENGER VOLUMES UP 6% OVER LAST YEAR. >>. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY: TOM PACK YOUR PATIENCE. HAVE YOU HEARD THAT ONE BEFORE? >>. Reporter. THAT IS A. >> Reporter: THAT IS A TRADEMARK. >>. HERE IS A QUESTION. THE REASON WE GO THROUGH THESE CHECKPOINTS IS NOT TO ANNOY ALL OF US AND SLOW US DOWN. IT IS FOR SECURITY AND KEEP US SAFE ON THE PLANE. HOW DO THEY NAVIGATE THAT? WE ALWAYS SEE IMAGES EVERY YEAR OF THE CRAZY THINGS PEOPLE LEAVE AT CHECKPOINTS THAT ARE CONFISCATED SAFETY VERSUS SPEED. HOW DO THEY NAVIGATE THAT? >>. Reporter WAS ALSO AT HIS. >>. Reporter WAS ALSO AT HIS DOOR -- UNDERSCORE. IT WAS HELD UP AFTER 9/11.. THERE IS STILL CONFISCATING RECORD NUMBERS OF GUNS EVERY YEAR. THAT IS A BIG QUESTION. CAN THE STILL ACHIEVE EXPEDITION BUT AT THE SAME TIME HAVE A SECURE CHECKPOINT? THERE IS ALSO THIS GOING ON. THAT IS THE CONCERN ABOUT WHERE WE ARE AND THE COMPETITIVENESS IN TERMS OF OTHER COUNTRIES. AND HOW WILL YOU? -- WELL, THEY SCREEN PASSENGERS. WE ARE NUMBER 17 IN TERMS OF COMPETITIVENESS. THAT IS BASED ON, AMONG OTHER THINGS. HOW COULD THE AIRPORT IS? ARE THEY CRUMBLING? -- THIS IS NATIONWIDE. >>. BREAK IN IS PULLING UP THE AVERAGE BUT MAYBE ANOTHER AIRPORT PULLS THAT DOWN? >>. Reporter. THAT WAS AN EDITORIAL ON YOUR PART. I THINK IT IS A LITTLE GLITCHY. IT MAY BE TOO MUCH TO ASK A PASSENGERS RIGHT NOW. >>. WE WILL SEE >>. Reporter. IF YOU CAN'T, >>. Reporter. IF YOU CAN'T REMEMBER THE BANANA CODE, IF IT A CHANCE TO START FRESH, WE WANT TO WELCOME YOU INTO SHARE. A MOMENT THAT BRIGHTENS YOUR DAY BEUSE EVERYDAY, YOUR DAY BEUSE EVERYDAY DESERVES THE BEST START>>>. IN DEPTH REPORTING ON A TOPIC WE HAVE BEEN WATCHING TONIGHT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. TONIGHT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NUCLEAR POWER AND AI. THOSE TWO WORDS TOGETHER. FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE MAY FEEL A LITTLE SCARY NUKES AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. FOR OTHERS IT MAY BRING BACK FRIGHTENING MEMORIES OF DISASTERS LIKE THREE MILE ISLAND OR CHERNOBYL. BUT A NEW GENERATION OF ENTREPRENEURS AT A SILICON VALLEY WANT TO BUILD NEWER AND SAFER PLANS TO POWER THE FUTURE OF AI. >>. Reporter. THIS REMOTE SITE IN EASTERN IDAHO COULD SOON BE THE BIRTHPLACE OF A NEW NUCLEAR, THE BIRTHPLACE OF A NEW NUCLEAR AGE. >> THE REPROCESSING AND PREFABRICATION OF HIGHLY RADIOACTIVE FUEL >>. Reporter. THE IDAHO NATIONAL LAB IS A RESEARCH FACILITY WERE, IN THE 1970s, THE US GOVERNMENT EXPERIMENTED WITH A SAFER KIND OF NUCLEAR REACTOR. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PUT THERE EARLY RESEARCH REACTORS OUT HERE, BECAUSE IT IS FULL OF UNDERGROUND WATER AND, FRANKLY, THERE IS NO ONE OUT HERE. DECADES AFTER, THE PLANT STOPPED RUNNING. A SILICON VALLEY COMPANY WANTS TO BUILD A NEW VERSION, A 15 MEGAWATT REACTOR CALLED AURORA. THE REACTOR WILL USE LIQUID METAL AS COOLANT LEFT OVER NUCLEAR WASTE FROM THE GOVERNMENT AS FUEL. THIS IS A PLACE WHERE THEY RECOVER THE FUEL. >> THAT WE FABRICATE IT. >>. Reporter. THE CEO HAS BEEN WORKING IN NUCLEAR SINCE HE WAS 16 AND A VICIOUS HIS REACTOR POWERING A TOWN OR FACTORY. >>. FOR MOST OF MY LIFE, THERE HAS NOT BEEN A QUESTION ABOUT THE DEMAND FOR WHAT NUCLEAR ENERGY IS, WHICH IS RELIABLE, CLEAN AND AFFORDABLE. >>. Reporter. JEFF BEZOS BILL. >>. Reporter. JEFF BEZOS BILL, GATES AND A HOST OF VC FIRMS HAVE INVESTED IN SEVERAL NUCLEAR COMPANIES. >>. THERE IS A LONG HISTORY OF HUMANS AND MACHINES WORKING TOGETHER- TOGETHER. >>. Reporter.

Reporter. BUT THIS IS ON -- NOT UNREGULATED BY AI. THIS IS NUCLEAR WHERE THE WASTE WILL REMAIN DANGEROUSLY RADIOACTIVE FOR CENTURIES IN 2022,. THE NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION SAID THEY HAD NOT. COMMISSION SAID THEY HAD NOT PROVIDED ENOUGH SAFETY INFORMATION. THE COMPANY IS WORKING TO SATISFY REGULATORS. >>. YOU HAVE TO USE PHYSICS, NEW MODELS AND ALL SORTS OF STUFF DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THEY ARE USED TO. A LOT OF THINGS THEY ARE USED TO DON'T APPLY. THEY ARE INSURING THIS MEET ADEQUATE SAFETY REQUIREMENTS. >>. Reporter. IN IDAHO FALLS, PEOPLE SEEM PRETTY COMFORTABLE WITH THE IDEA. >> I THINK IT IS GREAT. >>. Reporter, YOUR PRETTY COMFORTABLE WITH NUCLEAR POWER? >> OH YEAH. >>. Reporter, A GROWING NUMBER OF AMERICANS FEEL THE SAME, BUT CRITICS ARGUE NUCLEAR SALSA: PROBLEM FOR TECH CEOs AND NOT FOR HUMANITY. >> IF YOU WERE TO INTEGRATE GPT STYLE MODELS INTO SEARCH ENGINES, IT IS GOING TO COST FIVE TIMES AS MUCH, FIVE TIMES AS MUCH, ENVIRONMENTALLY AS STANDARD. I WANT TO SEE INNOVATION IN THIS COUNTRY. I JUST WANT THE SCOPE OF INNOVATION TO BE DETERMINED BEYOND YOU KNOW THE INCENTIVE, BEYOND YOU KNOW THE INCENTIVE STRUCTURES OF THESE GIANT COMPANIES. >>. Reporter. COULDN'T WE JUST CUT BACK ON ENERGY CONSUMPTION? WHY DO WE NEED MORE TO FEED OUR SOCIETY? MORE AND MORE POWER? >> YEAH, I WILL ANSWER THAT IN TWO WAYS. WE HAVE ALWAYS SEEN A DIRECT CORRELATION BETWEEN ENERGY ABUNDANCE AND ALL ASPECTS OF QUALITY OF LIFE NOT TO MENTION. WE ARE ALSO TRYING TO DECARBONIZE. WE'RE STILL SO FAR AWAY FROM ELECTRIFYING VEHICLES. THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY WE NEED TO DO THAT IS HUGE, SERVING HUMANITY'S INTERESTS. SERVING HUMANITY'S INTERESTS- ARE WE TRYING TO LIVE WITH MORE POWER, OR ARE WE TRYING TO LIVE WITH LESS? >>. THESE ARE DIFFICULT AND REALLY INTENSE QUESTIONS.

258,7qW9jx3A9a0,Stay Tuned NOW with Gadi Schwartz - March 4 | NBC News NOW,NBC News,2024-03-05 03:47:57+00:00,"I'M TOM LLAMAS IN NEW YORK. STAY RIGHT THERE. MORE NEWS IS ON THE WAY >>. ESSENTIALLY, YOU CANNOT TAKE SOMEBODY OUT OF A RACE BECAUSE THEIR APPOINT WOULD LIKE TO HAVE IT THAT WAY. MOST ARE THRILLED TO HAVE ME, BUT THERE WERE SOME THAT DIDN'T AND THEY DIDN'T WANT THAT FOR POLITICAL REASONS >>>. THAT'S A DONALD TRUMP VICTORY LAP. AFTER SCORING A MAJOR WIN AT THE SUPREME COURT, WITH A UNANIMOUS DECISION TODAY RULING THAT THE STATE OF COLORADO CANNOT KICK HIM OFF THE BALLOT FOR WHAT HAPPENED ON JANUARY 6th. I'M GADI SCHWARTZ AND THIS IS. STAY TUNED NOW >>>. AND TODAY THE SUPREME >>>. AND TODAY THE SUPREME COURT OVERTURNING COLORADO'S DECISION TO REMOVE TRUMP FROM THE PRIMARY BALLOT OVER HIS ROLE IN JANUARY 6th. BUT TODAY'S DECISION ALSO KIND OF SIDE STEPPED THE BIG ISSUE OF WHETHER TRUMP TOOK PART IN AN INSURRECTION AND INSTEAD RULED THAT THIS IS A STATE POWER VERSUS FEDERAL POWER ISSUE AND THAT COLORADO JUST DOESN'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO REMOVE FEDERAL CANDIDATES FROM A BALLOT. THAT'S UP TO CONGRESS. THE HIGH COURT ESSENTIALLY SAYING COLORADO WAS OUT OF BOUNDS WHEN IT DISQUALIFIED TRUMP UNDER THE 14th AMENDMENT THEY SAY TRUMP'S NAME WILL APPEAR ON COLORADO'S PRIMARY BALLOT TOMORROW, AND IT PUTS AN END TO SIMILAR CHALLENGES HE FACES IN MAINE AND ILLINOIS. EVEN THOUGH. THE DECISION WAS UNANIMOUS. THERE WAS SOME DISAGREEMENT OVER THE LIMITS TO POWER WITH LIBERAL JUSTICES WRITING QUOTE: THE MAJORITY ATTEMPTS TO INSULATE ALL ALLEGED INSURRECTIONISTS FROM FUTURE CHALLENGES TO THEIR HOLDING FEDERAL OFFICE, THE, THE COLORADO SECRETARY OF STATE AGREEING WITH THEM HERE'S WHAT SHE SAID EARLIER >>. MY LARGER REACTION IS DISAPPOINTMENT. I DO BELIEVE THAT STATES SHOULD BE ABLE, UNDER OUR CONSTITUTION, TO BAR OATH BREAKING INSURRECTIONISTS. AND, ULTIMATELY, THIS DECISION LEAVES OPEN THE, THE DOOR FOR CONGRESS TO ACT, TO PASS AUTHORIZING LEGISLATION. BUT WE KNOW THAT CONGRESS IS NEARLY A NONFUNCTIONING BODY. SO ULTIMATELY, IT'S UP TO THE AMERICAN VOTERS TO SAVE OUR DEMOCRACY >>. AND NBC NEWS' KEN DELANIAN HAS MORE >>. Reporter GADI. THE COURT'S MESSAGE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE CLEAR. STATES DO NOT HAVE THE POWER TO REMOVE A FEDERAL CANDIDATE FOR OFFICE ON THE GROUNDS OF THE CONSTITUTION'S 14th AMENDMENT. THE RULING SAID IT WOULD BE CHAOTIC, MESSY AND UNFAIR TO HAVE INDIVIDUAL STATES KNOCKING OUT PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES AND SAID IT WOULD INVITE A PARTISAN REVENGE CYCLE. THAT WOULD LEAVE ONLY A HANDFUL OF STATES DECIDING WHO BECOMES PRESIDENT. THE RULES DID NOT ADDRESS WHETHER TRUMP ENGAGED IN INSURRECTION. MR TRUMP CALLED THE DECISION. MR TRUMP CALLED THE DECISION A BIG DAY FOR LIBERTY, WHILE CRITICS EXPRESSED DISAPPOINTMENT. THREE LIBERAL JUSTICES, JOINED BY AMY CONEY-BARRETT COMPLAINED. THIS FORECLOSED OTHER AVENUES OF ENFORCEMENT, SUCH AS A FEDERAL LAWSUIT, RESULTING IN A FINDING THAT TRUMP COMMITTED INSURRECTION. THEY ALSO POINTED OUT THAT OTHER CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS ABOUT THE PRESIDENCY DON'T HAVE FEDERAL LAWS TO ENFORCE THEM, INCLUDING THE 22nd AMENDMENT THAT LIMITS THE PRESIDENT TO TWO TERMS. BUT THE QUESTION OF WHETHER MR TRUMP CAN BE ON THE PRESIDENTIAL BALLOT NOW IS SETTLED. NOW WE WAIT TO SEE WHAT THEY'LL DO IN ANOTHER CASE THAT COULD IMPACT THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. THE QUESTION OF WHETHER PRESIDENTS ARE IMMUNE FROM PROSECUTION. MR TRUMP'S TRIAL ON CHARGES OF PLOTTING TO OVERTURN THE ELECTION IS ON HOLD UNTIL APRIL AND THE COURT WILL ISSUE A RULE, LIKELY IN JUNE. >>. KEN, THANK YOU SO MUCH. AND FOR DRILLING DOWN A LITTLE DEEPER, WE GO TO OUR LEGAL ANALYST, DANNY CEVALLOS. SO WHAT ARE THE LIBERAL JUSTICES SAYING HERE? IT SEEMS LIKE THEY'RE COMPLAINING THAT PARTS OF THIS GO TOO FAR. BUT ARE THEY ALSO SAYING THIS PROTECTS TRUMP FROM OTHER CONTROVERSIES TOO? >>. YES, BOILED DOWN. REALLY, ALL THIS OPINION SAYS IS THAT THE STATES CANNOT DECIDE THAT SOMEONE IS AN INSURRECTIONIST AND REMOVE THEM FROM THE BALLOT. NOW, THIS IS WHERE THE JUSTICES DISAGREE. THE LIBERAL JUSTICES SAY THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN PERIOD, END OF SENTENCE. AND SO DOES JUSTICE BARRETT, BY THE WAY, AS WELL, THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE GONE ON TO SORT OF THEORIZE OR WAX ELOQUENTLY ABOUT WHO DOES HAVE THE POWER AND MEANS OF REMOVING A CANDIDATE FROM THE BALLOT, BECAUSE THE GENERAL RULE IS. THE SUPREME COURT REALLY SHOULD ONLY DECIDE AN ISSUE BEFORE IT. IT SHOULD TRY TO NARROW THE RULING TO THE FACTS AND TO THE LAWS BEFORE IT AND AVOID GOING OUT ON A LIMB. AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT THE LIBERAL JUSTICES SAID. THEY SAY, BY DESCRIBING THE SITUATION THAT MAY APPLY BY WHICH A FEDERAL- LET'S SAY LEGISLATURE- CONGRESS- WHATEVER- CAN REMOVE A BALLOT PERSON FROM THE BALLOT, THEY WENT TOO FAR BUT THE JUSTICES ARE UNANIMOUS THAT THE STATES CANNOT REMOVE A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE. THEY JUST DON'T AGREE ON HAMMERING DOWN THE SITUATION IN WHICH A CANDIDATE CAN BE REMOVED >>. AND AFTER THIS, TRUMP SEEMS TO BE SHIFTING HIS FOCUS TO ANOTHER ISSUE. THE SUPREME COURT WILL HEAR WHICH IS PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY AND WHETHER TRUMP CAN BE CRIMINALLY PROSECUTED FOR HIS EFFORTS TO OVERTURN THE 2020 RESULTS. HERE'S HIM TALKING ABOUT THAT EARLIER TODAY. LET'S TAKE A LISTEN. >>. AND WHILE WE'RE ON THE SUBJECT, AND ANOTHER THING THAT WILL BE COMING UP VERY SOON WILL BE IMMUNITY FOR A PRESIDENT, NOT FOR ME, BUT FOR ANY PRESIDENT. IF A PRESIDENT DOESN'T HAVE FULL IMMUNITY, THEN YOU REALLY DON'T HAVE A PRESIDENT, BECAUSE NOBODY THAT IS SERVING IN THAT OFFICE WILL BE THE COURAGE TO MAKE IN MANY CASES WHAT WOULD BE THE RIGHT DECISION, OR IT COULD BE THE WRONG DECISION. IT COULD BE, IN SOME CASES, THE WRONG DECISION >>. SO THE SUPREME COURT, THE RULING WE SAW TODAY, DOES IT HAVE ANY BEARING, OR AT LEAST ANY HINT, AS TO WHAT WE COULD SEE IN THE IMMUNITY CASE SOON >> ZERO. YOU MAY FIND PEOPLE THAT DISAGREE WITH ME, BUT I DON'T THINK THESE CASES ARE EVEN REMOTELY RELATED. DURING ORAL ARGUMENTS: SOME OF THE STRONGEST ARGUMENTS FOR KEEPING TRUMP ON THE BALLOT CAME VIA QUESTIONS FROM THE LIBERAL JUSTICES. AFTER ORAL ARGUMENT, THERE SEEMED TO BE LITTLE DOUBT THAT TRUMP WOULD REMAIN ON THE BALLOT. THE PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY IS A TOTALLY DIFFERENT TOPIC. THE DISTRICT COURT AND THE COURT OF APPEALS BOTH CAME DOWN ON THE SAME SIDE WITH WELL REASONED OPINIONS. NOW DOUBTERS MAY SAY: WELL, IT'S SUSPICIOUS THAT THE SUPREME COURT EVEN TOOK UP IMMUNITY. WHY TAKE IT UP IF NOT TO OVERTURN IT? BUT THE COURT ALSO SAID: WE'RE NOT EXPRESSING A SIGNIFICANCE OPINION ON THIS. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT CRIMINAL JUSTICE QUESTION OF OUR LIFETIME. SO THEY LIKELY WANT TO WEIGH IN FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN THAT AND NOT SPECIFICALLY TO OVERTURN IT. SO IF YOU'RE PREDICTING. THIS DECISION TODAY HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IMMUNITY, AND I THINK THE COURT WILL COME DOWN ON THE SAME SIDE AS THE CIRCUIT AND DISTRICT COURT CAME DOWN ON PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY. >>. DANNY, WE'LL BE CHECKING BACK WITH YOU ON THAT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. >>>. IT'S CRUNCH TIME IN CALIFORNIA'S HIGH MOUNTAINS, AND BY CRUNCH WE MEAN THE SOUND OF A WHOLE LOT OF SNOW CRUNCHING UNDER PEOPLE'S FEET AS THEY TRY TO DIG THEMSELVES OUT OF THE MONSTER BLIZZARD. AND THEY'RE DOING IT BEFORE ANOTHER STORM ROLLS THROUGH UP TO TEN FEET OF SNOW FELL THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS. WHOLE TOWNS WERE BLANKETED SO MUCH SNOW THAT EVEN SKI RESORTS HAD TO CLOSE. SOME SNOW BLOWERS BROKE DOWN TOO AND THE WIND WAS INSANE. WE'RE TALKING: 190 MILES PER HOUR IN SOME AREAS. THOSE ARE CATEGORY 5 LEVEL SPEEDS MEASURED AT SOME OF THE STATE'S HIGHEST PEAKS. MAJOR HIGHWAYS SHUT DOWN OVER THE WEEKEND AND JUST REOPENED TODAY, INCLUDING 100 MILES OF INTERSTATE 80, AND IT'S NOT OVER. YET. WINTER STORM WARNINGS ARE IN EFFECT FOR THE NORTHERN SYRIA, FOR ANOTHER STORM IN THE FORECAST. METEOROLOGIST BILL KARINS IS STANDING BY TRACKING ALL OF THAT. BUT FIRST WE GO TO STEVE PATTERSON IN TRUCKEE, CALIFORNIA. YOU HEAR TEN FEET OF SNOW, 190 MILES PER HOUR, WINDS. HOW BAD WAS IT WHEN YOU WERE HUNKERED DOWN >>. Reporter. IT WAS 72 HOURS OF CONTINUOUS SNOW, THREE TO FIVE INCHES EVERY HOUR. IN SOME COMMUNITIES THIS STORM WAS RIDICULOUS. HERE IN TRUCKEE, OF COURSE, PEOPLE ARE USED TO THE SHOW BUT THEY'RE NOT USED TO TEN FEET. WE WENT UP INTO THE MOUNTAINS WHERE THERE WAS A NEIGHBORHOOD AND THE SNOW DRIFTS WERE TEN FEET UP TO THE SECOND FLOOR OF PEOPLE'S HOUSES OF COURSE. THE MOST DANGEROUS PART OF THIS WAS WHAT HAPPENED ON THE ROADS. THERE WAS AN AVALANCHE JUST SOUTH OF LAKE TAHOE WHERE SEVERAL CARS WERE COVERED. THANKFULLY, NO ONE WAS HURT. INTERSTATE 80 WAS A HUGE FOCUS OF THIS STORM. VEHICLES WERE LEFT, ABANDONED ON THE ROAD DUE TO WHITEOUT CONDITIONS, SPIN OUTS. PEOPLE HAD TO BE RESCUED FROM THEIR VEHICLES, THEIR CARS, THEIR TRUCKS. THE CHP CAME PULLED PEOPLE OUT, LEFT THE VEHICLES AND THEN SHUT DOWN THE HIGHWAY FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS OR SO. THAT'S A MAJOR ARTERY IN THE AREA. PEOPLE NEED I-80 TO ESSENTIALLY GET AROUND, TO GET TO THEIR COMMUNITIES. SO A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE ESSENTIALLY CUT OFF BECAUSE OF THIS. THIS WAS A VERY, VERY BAD SYSTEM. I THINK IF YOU TALK TO A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE, THEY'RE, OF COURSE VERY PROUD AND HEARTY ABOUT HOW THEY HANDLE THE SNOW. A LOT OF FOLKS WILL TELL YOU THAT LAST YEAR WAS WORSE BUT CERTAINLY WITH THE PEOPLE I SPOKE TO, THEY SAY IT DEFINITELY CAUGHT THEM OFF GUARD. >>. AND WHAT DO THE RECORDS SAY WAS LAST YEAR WORSE? >>. Reporter. SO 1989, I THINK WE GOT 52 INCHES IN ONE DAY. THE SINGLE DAY THAT WE GOT HERE WAS 23 OR SO INCHES, SO NOT NECESSARILY REACHING RECORD LEVELS. ALTHOUGH WE SAW WIND GUSTS IN THE MOUNTAINS OF 190 MILES PER HOUR. THAT'S MORE THAN A CATEGORY 5 HURRICANE. THE SNOW LAB THAT WE'RE TALKING TO THEY SAY THEY'RE STILL ACCOUNTING FOR ALL THE TOTALS. TECHNICALLY, THE SNOW IS STILL FALLING, SO IT'S NOT OVER. >>. DO YOU THINK PEOPLE ARE READY FOR THE NEXT ONE? I KNOW IT WILL BE A LITTLE BIT, HOPEFULLY MUCH LESS THAN WHAT WE JUST SAW. BUT ARE PEOPLE OVER IT? >>. Reporter. I'LL TELL YOU THIS. I WOULD SAY UNEQUIVOCALLY YES, THIS SIDEWALK IS COMPLETELY CLEAR, AS IS EVERY STREET IN THE DOWNTOWN AREA AND EVERY HIGHWAY WE'VE BEEN. AND THIS IS JUST ONE DAY OF NO SNOW, THE DAY BEFORE YOU COULD BARELY MOVE WITHOUT GOING ABOUT 5 MILES PER HOUR. CREWS ARE VERY EFFICIENT AT CLEARING SNOW. I THINK IF THEY'RE ABLE TO DO THAT AND KEEP PACE WITH THE SNOW THAT FALLS, THEN THERE'S NOT A REAL RISK OF ROOF COLLAPSES, BECAUSE THEY'VE DEALT WITH THAT BEFORE AND KNOW HOW TO CLEAR IT, AND RESIDENTS ARE AWARE. IF IT'S GOING TO SNOW, THEY NEED TO NOT BE ON THE ROADS. THAT'S WHY WE'VE COVERED A 72 HOUR STORM AND REALLY, THE WORST THING WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IS A BIG ROAD CLOSURE. >>. STEVE PATTERSON, HOPE YOU'RE STAYING WARM OUT THERE UNDERNEATH ALL THOSE LAYERS. THANKS SO MUCH, BROTHER. >>>. TURNING NOW TO NBC NEWS METEOROLOGIST BILL KARINS, I KNOW LAST WEEK YOU WERE SAYING IT WOULD BE HURRICANE FORCE WINDS. I DIDN'T BELIEVE YOU. 190 MILES PER HOUR BLOWS MY MIND. WHAT'S NEXT AFTER THIS HISTORIC BLIZZARD? >> YEAH, IT'S CRAZY TO SAY THAT WE'RE LIKE. OKAY, WE'LL HAVE A CRAZY 100 MILES PER HOUR PLUS WINDS AND FIVE TO TEN FEET OF SNOW. EVERYONE IS LIKE. YEAH, RIGHT, BUT IT WAS TEN FEET OF SNOW. THERE'S DRIFTS OF 15 FEET OR HIGHER. WE JUST GOT DONE WITH A BLIZZARD EARLIER THIS MORNING WE FINALLY GOT A BREAK. EVERYONE IS DIGGING OUT. HIGHWAY 50 AND INTERSTATE 80 OPENED UP. NOW THE NEXT ONE IS MOVING. IN YESTERDAY IT LOOKED LIKE THIS ONE COULD DUMP ANOTHER ONE TO TWO FEET IN THE AREAS TRYING TO RECOVER. WE SAID THAT'S NOT FAIR. BUT THIS IS NOW TRENDING FURTHER TO THE NORTH. SO HERE'S THE TOTALS FROM THE BIG STORM. THE ONE WE JUST FINISHED WENT FROM THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH THIS MORNING SUGAR BOWL WAS THE HIGHEST: 10.5 FEET OF SNOW, 126 INCHES. I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE. THE MOST I'VE SEEN IS 38 INCHES. AND YOU MENTIONED THE, THE PALISADES, TAHOE. THEY MEASURED 93 INCHES AND THAT'S WHERE THEY HAD THE 190 MILES PER HOUR WIND GUSTS. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU CAN MEASURE SNOW IN THOSE WINDS ANYWAY, BUT REGARDLESS, IT'S AN EPIC STORM AND A TON OF SNOW. SO FOR THIS NEXT STORM, TAHOE IS OUT OF THE WARNING. EARLIER TODAY YOU WERE IN THE WARNING BUT SINCE THE STORM IS TRENDING NORTH, IT WILL BE MORE AROUND MOUNT SHASTA AND THE CASCADES. THEY CAN DEAL WITH IT. THEY DIDN'T GET A TON OF SNOW FROM THE LAST STORM. WE'LL GET SNOW THROUGH AREAS OF IDAHO AND JACKSON HOLE. THE SNOW FORECAST NOTICE. TAHOE IS ONLY ONE TO THREE INCHES. MOUNT SHASTA UP TO A FOOT CRATER LAKE, SAME WITH YOU. MOUNT WHITNEY, NOT AS MUCH SHOW. MAMMOTH HAD ABOUT FOUR FEET FROM THE LAST STORM, SO EVEN A BIG STORM BY THEIR STANDARDS. SO HERE'S HOW IT PLAYS OUT TONIGHT AS THE STORM SLOWLY DRIFTS DOWN THE COAST, WE'LL SEE MOSTLY NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WITH IT DURING THE DAY. ON TUESDAY, WE TRY TO GET A LITTLE RAIN IN SAN FRANCISCO MID-DAY WEDNESDAY BUT A LOT OF IT MISSES YOU. LOS ANGELES. THE TIMING FOR YOUR RAIN IS WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON TO EARLY THURSDAY, NOT A HUGE RAIN EVENT. SO A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE ASKING IF WE'LL GET ANOTHER BIG STORM ON TOP OF THIS ONE. NEXT WEEK'S OUTLOOK SHOWS WARMER CONDITIONS IN THE WEST, SORRY COOLER IN THE WEST, WARMER IN THE EAST. UNFORTUNATELY, IT LOOKS LIKE ANOTHER CHANCE OF A STORM OR TWO NEXT WEEK BUT MOST OF THIS WILL BE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA- THE ONE BAD THING. WE HAVE TO WATCH TEXAS, ESPECIALLY NORTH TEXAS, WHERE THE HORRIFIC FIRES HAVE BEEN. THEY'RE NOT EXPECTING MUCH IF ANY RAIN, NOT JUST THE SECTION SEVEN OR TEN DAYS UNTIL WE GET A SOAKING RAIN. THE BRUSH FIRE POTENTIAL WILL BE HIGH ANY DAY IT GETS WINDY. TOMORROW THE WINDS PICK UP A LITTLE BIT INTO THE 15 TO 20 MILES PER HOUR RANGE. THAT'S NOT HORRIFIC BUT STILL ANY DAY THAT IT GETS WINDY. ALL THE FIREFIGHTERS HAVE TO BE LOOKING OUT FOR THE STORMS. THE OTHER STORY: THE THE EAST COAST GETS SOCKED IN A RAINY WEATHER PATTERN SETTING UP FOR THE WEST. NO BIG STORMS ON THE WAY, EXCEPT THIS LITTLE MINI ONE TOMORROW BUT THAT'S MOSTLY THE SOUTHERN CASCADES >>. JUST IN TIME TO RECALIBRATE THE WIND GAUGES OUT THERE, BILL KARINS, THANKS FOR JOINING US. >>>. AND MEANWHILE IN NEW MEXICO THEY'RE STILL TRYING TO UNRAVEL THE MYSTERY OVER HOW LIVE AMMUNITION ENDED UP IN THAT GUN THAT KILLED HELENA HUTCHINS ON THE SET OF THE MOVIE RUST. THE PERSON RESPONSIBLE FOR SUPPLYING THE GUNS AND BLANKS TO THE SET TOOK THE STAND TODAY. HE SAID THE LIVE AMMO DID NOT COME FROM HIM. HE SUGGESTED THAT THE ARMORER MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN THEM FROM THEIR DAD, WHO WAS A FILM ARMORER AS WELL AND COULD BECOME A KEY WITNESS FOR THE DEFENSE AND REMEMBER THE EVIDENCE TAMPERING CHARGE AGAINST GUTIERREZ-REED WELL, IT CAME FROM ALLEGATIONS. SHE GAVE SOMEONE COCAINE TO HOLD FOR HER. TODAY WE HEARD FROM THAT PERSON: >> WHAT DOUBLE TO BE IN THE BAG? >>. I BELIEVED IT TO BE COCAINE. >>. AND WHAT DID YOU DO WITH IT? >> I THREW IT IN THE HALLWAY TRASH. CAN. >> OTHER THAN YOUR GUESS? YOU HAVE NO IDEA FOR CERTAIN. WHAT WAS IN THE BAG >> CORRECT. >>. NBC NEWS' DANA GRIFFIN IS JOINING US FROM NEW MEXICO. LET'S START WITH THAT. WHAT ELSE DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE COKE THING? >>. Reporter: YES, THAT WAS REBECCA SMITH, THE RUST SET. MOM SHE WAS ASKED TO GO TO HANNAH'S HOTEL ROOM THE NIGHT OF THE SHOOTING. SHE SAID WHEN SHE WAS LEAVING. HANNAH SAID: CAN YOU HOLD ONTO THIS FOR ME? SHE AGREED, WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM AND WHEN SHE LOOKED DOWN. SHE WAS SO OFFENDED BECAUSE SHE'S A RECOVERING ADDICT, SHE WANTED NO PARTS OF THIS SO SHE THREW IT IN THE TRASH CAN. >>. DANA, WHAT ELSE DID? WE HEAR FROM THE AMMO SUPPLIER TODAY. >>. Reporter. YES, SETH KENNY TESTIFIED HE PROVIDED JUST ONE BOX OF THE 45 LONG COLT DUMMY ROUNDS TO THE SET OF RUST ON OCTOBER 12th. WE ALSO SAW VIDEO EVIDENCE PRESENTED TODAY SHOWING LIVE ROUNDS LOADED INTO ALEC BALDWIN'S GUN TWO DAYS BEFORE SETH KENNY SUPPLIED. SO THERE WAS A SEARCH WARRANT CONDUCTED ON KENNY'S SHOP AND THEY CONCLUDED THE LIVE ROUNDS FOUND ON. SET DID NOT MATCH THE LIVE ROUNDS HE HAD IN HIS OFFICE AND KENNY TESTIFIED THAT HANNAH REQUESTED THE ROUNDS AND, BECAUSE OF SUPPLY ISSUE, HE SAID SHE'D HAVE TO GET THEM FROM OTHER SUPPLIERS, INCLUDING HER FATHER. THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL THEORIES ABOUT HOW THE LIVE AMMO GOT MIXED IN, BUT THERE HAVE YET TO BE ANY DIRECT EVIDENCE PRESENTED IN COURT TO EXPLAIN EXACTLY WHERE THE ROUNDS CAME FROM THE DEFENSE. HOWEVER HAS ARGUED THAT SETH KENNY COULD HAVE HAD TIME TO DISCARD OF POTENTIAL EVIDENCE BECAUSE THAT SEARCH WARRANT WAS NOT CONDUCTED ON HIS SHOP UNTIL ABOUT A MONTH LATER. >> AND DANA, WE'RE NOW INTO THE SECOND WEEK. RIGHT, DO YOU THINK THIS COULD GO TO THE JURY BY THE END OF THE WEEK? >>. Reporter. IT COULD. THAT'S THE PLAN. THE PROSECUTION RESTED ITS CASE TODAY, SO TOMORROW THE DEFENSE WILL GET A CHANCE TO PRESENT WITNESSES AND EVIDENCE. ON THURSDAY, IT'S EXPECTED THAT CLOSING ARGUMENTS WILL BEGIN. SO IF THE JURY NEEDS JUST A FEW HOURS TO DELIBERATE, WE COULD HAVE A VERDICT BY FRIDAY >>. ALL RIGHT, WE'LL CHECK BACK WITH YOU THEN. THANK YOU SO MUCH. >>>. DON'T GO ANYWHERE. WE'RE JUST GETTING STARTED UP. NEXT, SOME SERIOUS LEGAL WHIPLASH ON THE BORDER. HOURS. AGO, THE SUPREME COURT TEMPORARILY HALTED A NEW TEXAS LAW THAT'S SUPPOSED TO GO INTO EFFECT THIS WEEKEND. WE'LL BREAK ALL THAT DOWN FOR YOU IN JUST A BIT. >>>. AND BIG NEWS FROM THE NFL: THE EAGLES JASON KELCE IS RETIRING. WE'LL HAVE MORE ON WHAT LED >>>. WELCOME BACK. >>>. WELCOME BACK. SOME BREAKING NEWS TONIGHT ON THE CONTROVERSIAL IMMIGRATION LAW IN TEXAS. BUT FIRST HERE ARE SOME OF THE OTHER HEADLINES WE'RE WATCHING TONIGHT THE MASSACHUSETTS AIRMAN ACCUSED OF LEAKING SECRET DOCUMENTS ON DISCORD JUST PLED GUILTY.

AND NIKKI HALEY IS FINALLY ON THE BOARD, WINNING HER FIRST REPUBLICAN PRIMARY IN WASHINGTON DC. HALEY DEFEATED DONALD TRUMP, SECURING NEARLY 63% OF THE VOTE. HER VICTORY COMES ON THE EVE OF SUPER TUESDAY, WHERE 15 STATES WILL HOLD THEIR CONTESTS >>>. AND REMEMBER THE MERGER BETWEEN SPIRIT AND JET BLUE AIRLINES. WELL, TODAY IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S OFF. TODAY, THEY ISSUED A JOINT STATEMENT SAYING IT WON'T HAPPEN. JUST WEEKS AFTER, A JUDGE RULED IT WOULD REDUCE COMPETITION AND MIGHT BE BAD FOR FINDING AFFORDABLE FLIGHTS >>>. AND PHILADELPHIA EAGLES CENTER JASON KELCE IS OFFICIALLY RETIRING FROM THE NFL. IN AN EMOTIONAL NEWS CONFERENCE EARLIER TODAY, HE THANKED HIS FANS, TEAM AND FAMILY FOR SUPPORT. HE SPENT HIS ENTIRE 13-SEASON CAREER WITH THE EAGLES. HE'S A SEVEN-TIME PRO BOWLER AND HELPED LEAD THE TEAM TO A SUPER BOWL WIN >>>. AND WHILE ONE LEGEND IS HANGING UP THE JERSEY. ANOTHER LEGEND IS BREAKING RECORDS. THIS WEEKEND, CAITLIN CLARK BECAME THE ALL TIME LEADING SCORER IN NCAA DIVISION 1 HISTORY, SCORING PAST THE 3,667 POINTS- THE OLD RECORD SET BY PISTOL PETE IN 1970.. THAT'S THE PERFECT END TO A RECORD SETTING SEASON FOR CLARK, WHO'S NOW WELL ON HER WAY TO THE 2024 WNBA DRAFT >>>. AND, BREAKING TONIGHT, THE SUPREME COURT HAS JUST PUT A PAUSE ON A CONTROVERSIAL IMMIGRATION LAW. THAT WAS ABOUT TO GO INTO EFFECT IN TEXAS. NOW SB4 WOULD LET LOCAL COPS ARREST AND JAIL MIGRANTS THEY SUSPECT OF CROSSING THE BORDER ILLEGALLY AND UP UNTIL A FEW HOURS AGO. IT WAS SET TO TAKE EFFECT ON MARCH 10th. THIS MORNING, THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION FILED AN EMERGENCY REQUEST ASKING THE SUPREME COURT TO STEP IN, AND LATE TODAY, THE SUPREME COURT DID JUST THAT, EXTENDING THE DEADLINE UNTIL MARCH 13th, GIVING THEMSELVES JUST NINE DAYS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO. LET'S BRING IN DAVID NORIEGA TO BREAK THIS. DOWN, DAVID. THERE HAVE BEEN SO MANY TWISTS AND TURNS HERE. IT WAS UPHELD, STRUCK DOWN, UPHELD. HOW DID WE GET TO WHERE WE ARE TODAY? >>? YES, SIR, A LOT OF THAT. WITHIN THE SPACE OF THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS, TEXAS GOVERNOR GREG ABBOT SIGNS THE BILL IN DECEMBER. IT'S SUPPOSED TO TAKE EFFECT IN WEEKEND. THIS IS A VERY FAR REACHING SORT OF STATE LEVEL IMMIGRATION BILL. THAT'S HUGELY CONSEQUENTIAL. JUST A FEW DAYS AGO, A FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT JUDGE BLOCKS I T THEN TODAY, THE 5th CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS REMOVES THE BLOCK, ALLOWED THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LAW TO CONTINUE THIS WEEKEND AND THEN, AT THE LAST MINUTE, THE SUPREME COURT, JUSTICE SAMUEL ALITO, SAYS: NO, WE NEED A FEW MORE DAYS, NOT UNTIL WEDNESDAY, WILL THE LAW TAKE EFFECT. IN THE MEANTIME, TEXAS NEEDS TO RESPOND TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S REQUEST FOR THE SUPREME COURT TO BLOCK THIS ENTIRELY IN TERMS OF THE MERITS OF THIS IT'S RELATIVELY COMPLICATED BUT ALSO NOT REALLY. THERE'S PRETTY CLEAR PRECEDENT THAT IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT IS THE PURVIEW OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. LAWS THAT ARE COMPARABLE TO THIS ONE HAVE BEEN STRUCK DOWN BY THE SUPREME COURT IN THE LAST YOU KNOW DECADE OR SO AT THE SAME TIME. THIS IS A DIFFERENT SUPREME COURT THAN WE'VE HAD IN THE LAST DECADE OR SO, AND WE LIVE IN A TIME OF SURPRISES. SO I DON'T WANT TO SAY ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN, BUT I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE ANY SURE PREDICTIONS. LET'S PUT IT THAT WAY. >>. JUST LOOKING AT SB1070 OUT OF ARIZONA, THIS HAPPENED THERE. NO LONGER IS THE CASE, OBVIOUSLY. BUT LET'S SAY: THIS DOES GO THROUGH AND THE SUPREME COURT YOU KNOW GIVES THIS THE STAMP. WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE THIS WEEKEND AND WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE NEXT WEEK? >>. YEAH, THE PEOPLE I'VE SPOKEN TO ON THE GROUND WHO WOULD IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER HAVE TO CONTEND WITH THIS LAW, GOING INTO EFFECT LAWYERS AND SUCH EXPECT, BASICALLY, CHAOS. THAT'S THE WORD I KEEP HEARING. THIS LAW, LIKE I SAID, IS VERY FAR REACHING. IT'S ALREADY A MISDEMEANOR UNDER FEDERAL LAW TO CROSS THE BORDER WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION BETWEEN PORTS OF ENTRY. THIS WOULD MAKE IT A MISDEMEANOR UNDER STATE LAW, WHICH WOULD ALLOW AND EMPOWER STATE LAW ENFORCEMENT AND GOVERNMENT TO ARREST AND PROSECUTE PEOPLE AT THE TIME OF CROSSING THE BORDER, WHICH UNTIL NOW HAS BEEN CLEARLY IN THE PURVIEW OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. IT WOULD ALSO ORDER STATE JUDGES TO ISSUE WHAT ARE SORT OF DEFACTO DEPORTATION ORDERS. IT WOULD ORDER SOMEONE RETURNED BACK TO MEXICO, REGARDLESS OF THEIR NATIONALITY. THAT QUESTION IN PARTICULAR, HOW IT WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED, NOBODY KNOWS. THERE ARE WAY MORE QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS BECAUSE UP UNTIL NOW. IT'S NEVER BEEN A THING FOR STATE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS TO DEPORT PEOPLE. THAT'S ALWAYS DONE BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. SO WOULD THEY TRANSFER PEOPLE TO THE CUSTODY OF BORDER PATROL OR CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION TO THEN YOU KNOW, RETURN PEOPLE TO MEXICO? WOULD THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT EVEN BWILLING TO ACCEPT THESE PEOPLE? SOME MEXICAN OFFICIALS HAVE CRITICIZED THE LAW. EARLY. INDICATIONS ARE NO WAY MORE QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS, BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY MORE QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS. THE GENERAL EXPECTATION IS THIS WOULD BE SUPER CHAOTIC, AND WHEN I THINK ABOUT ALL THIS ABBOT VERSUS BIDEN IMMIGRATION BATTLE WE'VE BEEN SEEING THE LAST FEW MONTHS, A LOT OF THESE THINGS ARE DESIGNED TO TAKE PLACE TO SORT OF OPERATE IN THE REALM OF POLITICS RATHER THAN THE REALM OF ACTUAL POLICY IMPLEMENTED ON THE GROUND. I THINK THIS IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THAT, BECAUSE NO ONE REALLY KNOWS WHAT THIS WOULD ACTUALLY LOOK LIKE. >> SPEAKING OF THIS, BIDEN VERSUS ABBOT THING, WE HAVE THE STATE OF THE UNION LATER THIS WEEK. DO YOU THINK THAT WE'LL HEAR FROM THE PRESIDENT ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE? >>. YOU KNOW, ON THE ONE HAND, THIS IS SUCH AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ISSUE AND IT'S SO VERY PRESENT IN POLITICAL DISCOURSE THAT I WOULD BE SURPRISED IF BIDEN DIDN'T AT LEAST MENTION IT. AT THE SAME TIME, THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION IS KIND OF ON ITS BACK FOOT ON IMMIGRATION AND THE BORDER REPORTING FROM SOME OF OUR COLLEAGUES ON SOME SNEAK PEEKS OF THE STATE OF THE UNION DON'T REALLY MISSION IMMIGRATION. IT'S ACTUALLY MORE LIKELY TO BE ABOUT THINGS AREAS WHERE BIDEN FEELS STRONGER: RUSSIA AND UKRAINE, CHARACTERIZING TRUMP AS A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY. SO YOU KNOW TO BE DETERMINED. AGAIN, I WOULD BE SURPRISED IF HE DIDN'T AT LEAST MENTION IT, BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT POLLING FOR EXAMPLE, PEOPLE INCREASINGLY CONSIDER THIS AN IMPORTANT PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED URGENTLY. IT WILL YOU BE A LITTLE BIT OF A GLARING OMISSION FOR BIDEN TO NOT DROP A REFERENCE OR TWO. >>. WE'LL KNOW IN ABOUT THREE DAYS, DAVID, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US >>>. AND YEAH, THURSDAY IS THE STATE OF THE UNION, BUT TUESDAY IS THE MAIN EVENT FOR PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY RACES, AND THE MOTHER OF ALL OF THEM IS SUPER TUESDAY IN CALIFORNIA. WE'LL BE PICKING THE CHOICE FOR THE SENATE: SCIFF, PORTER AND LEE, ALL VYING TO FILL FEINSTEIN'S SEAT. HERE'S THE LATEST FROM THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL >>. Reporter. IT'S GOING TO BE A VERY INTERESTING AND CONTESTED ELECTION HERE IN CONTESTED ELECTION HERE IN CALIFORNIA FOR THE RACE TO REPLACE THE LATE DIANE FEINSTEIN. THERE'S AN INTERESTING QUIRK IN OUR SYSTEM. HERE. IT'S A TOP TWO PRIMARY SYSTEM, MEANING TWO DEMOCRATS COULD END UP IN THE ELECTION, BUT ALSO A REPUBLICAN AS WELL. AND ADAM SCIFF HAS SENT MIGHTILY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO PROPEL STEVE GARVEY INTO THE TOP TWO TO FACE HIM IN THE RUN OFF. HE THINKS HE HAS A BETTER CHANCE OF BEATING HIM IN THE RUN OFF. IT'S SOMETHING THAT REPRESENTATIVES. PORTERS AND LEE ARE UPSET ABOUT. HERE'S WHAT THEY TOLD ME WHEN I SPOKE TO THEM EARLIER TODAY. >>. LET ME JUST SAY THAT'S A. >>. LET ME JUST SAY THAT'S A SINISTER KIND OF STRATEGY, BUT FOR ME I'M RUNNING A CAMPAIGN FOR CHANGE >>. Reporter. WE'LL TALK TO ADAM SCIFF TONIGHT AND AGAIN TOMORROW. TUN OUT IS ONE THING THAT MIGHT BE IMPACTED BY THE SPENDING ON BEHALF OF THE REPUBLICANS BY A DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE TURNOUT REALLY LOW HERE TODAY AT THE EARLY VOTING LOCATION IN SAN FERNANDO. REPUBLICAN TURNOUT KATIE. REPUBLICAN TURNOUT. KATIE PORTER. WARNS COULD GO UP BECAUSE OF THE WAY SCHIFF. IT'S KIND OF A REVERSE PSYCHOLOGY THING. IMMIGRATION IS A BIG THING. COST OF LIVING, INEQUALITY. THE GAP BETWEEN THE RICH AND THE POOR IS AS GREAT IN THIS STATE AS ANY OTHER STATE. ALL THOSE THINGS WILL BE ON THE MINDS OF VOTERS IF AND WHEN THEY SHOW UP AT THE POLLS TOMORROW. THE TOP THREE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES, FAMILIAR FACES HERE AND THEN STEVE GARVEY ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE COULD BE UP TO 30 DAYS IN CALIFORNIA. THEY COUNT SLOW HERE. >>. VERY SLOW, JACOB, THANK YOU SO MUCH. >>>. COMING UP TESLA'S APOCALYPTIC PROOF CYBER TRUCK, REMEMBER IT WELL. OVER THE WEEKEND ONE CRASHED INTO THE ICONIC BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL >>>. BUT FIRST YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS. I MEAN YOU'VE HEARD OF A WILD GOOSE CHASE. RIGHT WELL HOW ABOUT A WILD HORSE CHASE IN THE MIDDLE OF TRAFFIC.

HERE'S A TRUE HOLLYWOOD STORY: A TESLA CYBER TRUCK CRASHED INTO THE ICONIC BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL IN LOS ANGELES LAST NIGHT. THERE'S A LOT OF CONFUSION WHEN IT COMES TO WHO WAS DRIVING, BUT THE TRUCK'S WHOLE TRIANGLE VIBE SEEMS STILL INTACT THERE. ELON MUSK POSTED IT'S FASTER THAN A PORSCHE AND MAYBE A VALET. WASN'T EXPECTING SO MUCH ACCELERATION, BUT THE COMPANY THAT OPERATES THE HOTEL SAYS NO EMPLOYEE OR VALET WAS INVOLVED. >>>. AND THE WORLD'S MOST FAMOUS DOG SLED RACE IS BACK.

FIGHT FLAMES CHARGING THE TOWN OF SANFORD LATE SUNDAY, WHERE CREWS FOUGHT A FAMILIAR BATTLE, SOME PULLED FROM FIRES ELSEWHERE TO MAKE SURE THIS COMMUNITY STAYED HOME >>. WE'RE NOT USED TO THE CONDITIONS LINED UP LIKE THEY DID THIS WEEK, WITH THE HIGH WINDS AND LOW HUMIDITY FOR SUCH A LONG EVENT. IT ALL JUST LINED UP TO BE THE PERFECT STORM >>. Reporter. BURN SCARS NOW VISIBLE FROM SPACE. THESE SATELLITE IMAGES SHOWING THE CITY BEFORE THE WILDFIRES NOW BLACKENED EARTH. AUTHORITIES SAY THE CAUSE OF THE FIRE IS UNDER INVESTIGATION, BUT A NEW LAWSUIT ALLEGES EXCEL ENERGY, A UTILITY COMPANY, IS TO BLAME FOR THE SMOKE HOUSE FIRE. THE THE SUIT STATING A POLE THEY FAILED TO INSPECT, SNAPPED AT THE BASE, SENDING POWER LINES TO THE GROUND AND IGNITING THE FIRE. EXCEL SAYS THEY'RE COOPERATING WITH THE INVESTIGATION, WITH THE INVESTIGATION BACK IN CANADIAN TEXAS. THE LOSS OF LIVESTOCK IS SHOCKING. >>. WE'VE LOST 200 TO 250 HEADS. I'VE SPENT THE LAST TEN YEARS BUILDING THIS COW HERD UP AND YOU CAN LOSE IT OVERNIGHT. >>. Reporter. AND TONIGHT, WITH THE BLAZE, JUST 15% CONTAINED. EVERYONE IS HOPING FOR RAIN FORECAST LATER THIS WEEK. >>. HERE'S HOPING, MORGAN. THANK YOU SO MUCH. >>>. AND NOW TO AN NBC NEWS INVESTIGATION AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER WHICH HAS BECOME GROUND ZERO FOR FENTANYL TRAFFICKING. BORDER AGENTS ARE USING NEW TECHNOLOGY TO SCAN CARS AND TRUCKS, CROSSING THE BORDER TO FIND DRUGS HIDING IN ALL DIFFERENT PLACES. BUT OUR INVESTIGATION FOUND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF THE SCANNERS ARE NOT BEING USED AT ALL. NBC NEWS REPORTER JULIA AINSLEY HAS THE STORY >>. Reporter GADI. I'VE JUST RETURNED FROM NOGALES WHERE CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION CALL GROUND ZERO FOR FENTANYL. OVER HALF THE FENTANYL SEIZED COMING ACROSS THE BORDER LAST YEAR WAS STOPPED RIGHT THERE AT THAT PORT OF ENTRY. I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET A TOUR OF THE PLACE FROM THE CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION ACTING COMMISSIONER, TROY MILLER. HE SHOWED ME AROUND AND SHOWED ME SOME NEW TECHNOLOGY THEY'RE USING IN THE FIGHT AGAINST FENTANYL. HERE'S WHAT WE LEARNED TONIGHT. WE'RE ON THE FRONT LINES OF THE FENTANYL CRISIS. NOGALES, ARIZONA: HALF OF ALL FENTANYL SEIZED COMING FROM MEXICO. MEXICO IS STOPPED HERE, BUT CRITICS SAY THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION IS NOT DOING ENOUGH WITH FENTANYL OVERDOSES. NOW THE LEAD CAUSE OF DEATH FOR AMERICANS AGED 18 TO 45.. TROY MILLER SAYS: VIRTUALLY ALL FENTANYL IS BROUGHT ACROSS IN VEHICLES >> DRIVEN BY MEN, WOMEN, YOUNG, OLD US CITIZENS, MEXICAN CITIZENS >> Reporter. AND HE TELLS US BORDER AGENTS HAVE BEGUN USING A NEW TECHNOLOGY TO IDENTIFY FENTANYL HIDDEN IN VEHICLES. WE WATCH AS OFFICERS FIRST QUESTION DRIVERS AND INSPECT CARS, THEN THEY MAY BE REFERRED FOR A SCAN. THIS IS NEW TECHNOLOGY. THAT'S BEEN INSTALLED TO X-RAY CARS THAT OFFICERS SUSPECT MIGHT BE CARRYING NARCOTICS. IT'S BEEN INSTALLED NEAR IN NOGALES BECAUSE IT'S CONSIDERED GROUND ZERO FOR FENTANYL TRAFFICKING. BUT LESS THAN 5% OF PERSONAL VEHICLES AND 20% OF COMMERCIAL VEHICLES ARE SCANNED. WHY NOT SCAN EVERY VEHICLE THROUGH AN X-RAY? >>. WE SEE A MILLION PEOPLE CROSSING OUR BORDER EVERY SINGLE DAY. IF WE TRIED TO SCAN EVERY SINGLE SHIPMENT AND PERSON COMING INTO THIS COUNTRY, WE'D SHUT DOWN LEGITIMATE TRADE AND TRAVEL. >>. Reporter. AND TONIGHT WE LEARNED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF TAXPAYER PURCHASED FENTANYL SCANNERS ARE SITTING IN WAREHOUSES, UNUSED. >>. WE NEED APPROXIMATELY $300 MILLION TO PUT THE TECHNOLOGY IN THE GROUND. >>. Reporter. AND IT'S MONEY ALREADY SPENT, BUT IT'S SITTING THERE. IS THAT FRUSTRATING FOR YOU? >>. EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING? >>. Reporter. BUT IN TUCSON, TERESA IS ORDERING AUTHORITIES TO DO MUCH MORE. EVERY YEAR, ENOUGH FENTANYL IS TRAFFICKED INTO THE US TO KILL EVERY AMERICAN >>. I THINK THE BORDER NEEDS TO BE CLOSED, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, BECAUSE IT'S A SUPER HIGHWAY. YOU SAW HOW CLOSE TODAY THAT WE ARE AND THEY'RE JUST POURING IN. THIS IS, I BELIEVE, OUR LAST PICTURE TODAY. >>. Reporter. SHE LOST HER SON JACOB TEN YEARS AGO, WHEN HE TOOK A PILL ACCIDENTALLY LACED WITH FENTANYL, SHE SAID HE WAS ATHLETIC, A FREE SPIRIT AND ALWAYS READY TO HELP HIS FRIENDS. >> IF ONLY. YOU ALWAYS ASK THOSE QUESTIONS, BUT I DON'T WANT ANOTHER PARENT TO HAVE TO SAY IF ONLY. >>. Reporter. AND GADI TONIGHT, THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION IS ASKING CONGRESS FOR MORE FUNDING TO START USING THE CURRENTLY UNUSED SCANNERS. BUT REPUBLICAN IN CONGRESS HAVE SO FAR DENIED THE REQUEST FOR SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO GIVE MORE MONEY TO THE BIDEN BORDER POLICIES THAT, THEY SAY, ARE LETTING PEOPLE INTO THE COUNTRY UNDOCUMENTED. >>. JULIA, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT REPORT. >>>. AND IT'S BEEN ALMOST TEN YEARS TO THE DAY SINCE ONE OF THE WORLD'S BIGGEST MYSTERIES IN AVIATION. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MARCH 8th 2014.. MALAYSIA FLIGHT 370, DROPPING OFF FROM THE RADAR SHORTLY AFTER LEAVING CHINA AND DISAPPEARING FROM THE FACE OF THE EARTH. OFFICIALS THINK IT CRASHED SOMEWHERE IN THE INDIAN OCEAN AND NOW THERE'S A NEW EFFORT TO FIND THE PLANE. TOM COSTELLO HAS MORE. >>. Reporter. IT WAS TEN YEARS AGO. THIS WEEK, ONE OF THE WORLD'S GREAT AVIATION MYSTERIES BEGAN ON MARCH 8th 2014.. >> STILL, NO EMERGENCY TRANSMITTER SIGNAL, NO SIGN OF WRECKAGE. >>. Reporter. MALAYSIA AIRLINES FLIGHT 370, A RED EYE TO BEIJING SEEMED ROUTINE, BUT SOMETHING WENT TERRIBLY WRONG. RADAR AND SATELLITE DATA SUGGEST THE PLANE MADE A SUDDEN U-TURN, FLEW BACK OVER MALAYSIA, CUT NORTH AND THEN APPARENTLY TURNED SOUTH, DISAPPEARING SOMEWHERE IN THE SOUTHERN INDIAN OCEAN, AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT PLACE TO SEARCH. NBC'S KEIR SIMMONS SPENT WEEKS IN THE SEARCH ZONE. >> THERE'S NO SIGN OF FLIGHT 370.. >>. THIS IS AN AREA WITH VERY FEW PEOPLE, VERY FEW SHIPS. IT IS JUST A VERY VERY REMOTE PART OF OUR WORLD. >>. Reporter. NOW THE AMERICAN COMPANY OCEAN INFINITY IS PROPOSING A NEW SEARCH, WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF MALAYSIA SIGNALING SUPPORT. >> I'M VERY, VERY CONFIDENT. >>. Reporter. THEY ALREADY CONDUCTED A MONTH'S LONG SEARCH FOR THE PLANE IN 2018, BUT CAME UP EMPTY. THOUGH PIECES OF THE WRECKAGE HAVE WASHED ON SHORE, ON REUNION ISLAND, THOUSANDS OF MILES FROM THE SEARCH ZONE AND FURTHER SOUTH OFF THE COAST OF AFRICA. T A LK OF A NEW SEARCH COMES AS MANY OF THE 370 FAMILY MEMBERS GATHER TO HONOR THEIR LOVED ONES AHEAD OF THE TEN-YEAR MARK. >>. THE FAMILIES REALLY WANT CLOSURE TO THIS. >>. Reporter. ONE OF THOSE FAMILY MEMBERS, SARAH BOCCIC, WHO LOST HER BOYFRIEND PHILLIP WOOD. >> IT'S A TRAVESTY. WHAT HAPPENED? >>. Reporter. SHE'S SINCE MARRIED AND RUNS A RESORT IN PANAMA. WHILE SHE HAS DOUBTS THAT ANOTHER SEARCH WILL HAPPEN. SHE REMAINS HOPEFUL. >>. THEY OWE IT TO THE WORLD, TO THE FAMILY MEMBERS, TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED >>. Reporter: TOM COSTELLO, NBC NEWS. >> TOM, THANK YOU. >>> COMING UP, FRANCE IS NOW THE ONLY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD WHERE ABORTION RIGHTS ARE SPECIFICALLY PROTECTED IN THE CONSTITUTION. WE'LL HAVE MORE ON THAT GROUND BREAKING AMENDMENT AND OTHER HEADLINES YOU NEED TO KNOW. >>> WELCOME BACK. >>> WELCOME BACK. LET'S TAKE A QUICK LOOK AROUND. THE WORLD PARTS OF HAITI ARE UNDER CURFEW TONIGHT, AS VIOLENCE EXPLODED OVER THE WEEKEND. ARMED GANGS STORMED TWO OF THE BIGGEST PRISONS THERE, ALLOWING THOUSANDS OF INMATES TO ESCAPE. AT LEAST. NINE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED SINCE LAST WEEK, AND GANGS ARE STEPPING UP ATTACKS ON POLICE STATIONS AND EVEN THE COUNTRY'S AIRPORT >>>. THREE MEN HAVE BEEN ARRESTED IN INDIA, ACCUSED OF GANG RAPING A SPANISH TOURIST AND REPEATEDLY BEATING HER HUSBAND HUSBAND. A TOTAL OF SEVEN MEN ARE ACCUSED OF CARRYING OUT THE BRUTAL ASSAULT. >>>. AND CHINA'S LARGEST POLITICAL EVENT KICKS OFF TOMORROW. IT COULD ANSWER MOUNTING QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW CHINA PLANS TO STRENGTHEN THEIR ECONOMY, ESPECIALLY IN THE FACE OF ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY AND RISING TENSIONS WITH THE US >>>. AND IT LOOKS LIKE. THOUSANDS OF DOCTORS IN SOUTH KOREA WILL HAVE THEIR MEDICAL LICENSES SUSPENDED. THE SOUTH KOREAN GOVERNMENT BEGAN THE PROCESS OF DOING SO. TODAY AFTER, DOCTORS DID NOT MAKE THEIR DEADLINE TO END THE STRIKE. NEARLY 10,000 DOCTORS HAVE BEEN STRIKING FOR TWO WEEKS TO PROTEST A GOVERNMENT DECISION TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF MEDICAL SCHOOL ADMISSIONS >>>. AND THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION IS TRYING TO TURN UP THE PRESSURE ON ISRAEL TO AGREE TO A CEASEFIRE IN GAZA AS THE US MILITARY STARTS AIR DROPPING FOOD OVER THAT WAR TORN STRIP. NBC NEWS INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT RAF SANCHEZ HAS MORE >>. Reporter. WE'RE NOW 150 DAYS INTO THIS WAR AND WITH THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN GAZA DEEPENING BY THE HOUR VICE PRESIDENT, KAMALA HARRIS, TODAY MEETING AT THE WHITE HOUSE WITH A SENIOR MEMBER OF ISRAEL'S WAR CABINET, REITERATING US CALLS FOR AN IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE IN GAZA. THIS COMES A DAY AFTER THE VICE PRESIDENT DELIVERED SOME OF THE TOUGHEST CRITICISM THE ADMINISTRATION HAS LEVELED AT ISRAEL SO FAR IN THIS WAR. SHE CALLED THE SITUATION IN GAZA A HUMANITARIAN CATASTROPHE AND SAID ISRAEL NEEDED TO IMMEDIATELY ALLOW IN MORE AID FOR PALESTINIAN CIVILIANS. NO EXCUSES, SHE SAID. NOW THIS COMES AFTER THE US DROPPED SOME 38,000 READY MEALS INTO GAZA BY PARACHUTE FROM MILITARY AIRCRAFT. IT'S THE FIRST OF WHAT THE US SAYS WILL BE SEVERAL AID DROPS INTO THE STRIP. IT COMES AS THE UN WARNS THAT ABOUT A QUARTER OF THE POPULATION OF GAZA IS FACING FAMINE AT THIS POINT BUT AID GROUPS SAY THAT THESE DROPS ARE REALLY NOT ADEQUATE TO THE SCALE OF THE CHALLENGE IN GAZA. THEY SAY WHAT THE US REALLY NEEDS TO BE DOING IS PRESSURING ISRAEL TO OPEN UP NEW CROSSINGS TO GET FOOD IN BY LAND. PALESTINIANS ARE SAYING THAT THEY DON'T NEED AID DROPPED FROM THE SKY. WHAT THEY DO NEED IS THE US TO PUT PRESSURE ON ISRAEL TO STOP THE BOMBING- SOMETHING ISRAEL SAYS IT WON'T DO UNTIL HAMAS IS DESTROYED. MEANWHILE, CEASEFIRE NEGOTIATIONS ARE CONTINUING IN CAIRO, BUT AN ISRAELI OFFICIAL TELLS ME ONE OF THE MAJOR OBSTACLES AT THIS STAGE IS THAT HAMAS IS REFUSING TO PROVIDE A LIST OF WHICH HOSTAGES ARE STILL ALIVE. THIS ALSO COMES AS THE UN ISSUING A NEW REPORT SAYING: EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT HAMAS FIGHTERS COMMITTED RAPE AT AT LEAST THREE LOCATIONS DURING THE OCTOBER 7th ATTACK, AND SAYS: THERE IS CLEAR AND CONVINCING INFORMATION THAT SOME HOSTAGES IN GAZA HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO SEXUAL VIOLENCE WHILE IN CAPTIVITY. BACK TO YOU. >>. RAF SANCHEZ, THANK YOU SO MUCH. >>>. AND FRANCE HAS DONE SOMETHING THAT NO OTHER COUNTRY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD HAS DONE, WHICH IS MAKE ABORTION A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT. JOSH LEDERMAN HAS MORE. >>. Reporter. THIS IS A HISTORIC MOVE THAT MAKES FRANCE THE FIRST AND ONLY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD TO ENSHRINE ABORTION RIGHTS NOT JUST IN LAW, NOT JUST IN STATUTE BUT IN ITS CONSTITUTION. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IN YEARS THAT FRANCE HAS ACTUALLY AMENDED ITS CONSTITUTION. NOW IN FRANCE, UNLIKE IN THE UNITED STATES, THERE'S NOT AS MUCH CONTROVERSY ABOUT ABORTION STRAIGHTS. IN FACT, THE VOTE TONIGHT IN THE PALACE OF VERSAILLES WAS OVERWHELMING. SOME 780 LAWMAKERS SUPPORTING THIS, INCLUDING MANY FROM THE FAR RIGHT. ONLY 72 WERE OPPOSED TO THIS. THE CATHOLIC CHURCH HAS COME OUT AGAINST THIS. THEY CALLED FOR FASTING IN OPPOSITION TO THIS MOVE BUT, OVERWHELMINGLY, THE FRENCH SOCIETY SUPPORTS THIS MOVE, WHICH COMES JUST A FEW DAYS AHEAD OF INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY. THE FRENCH PRESIDENT MACRON CELEBRATING THE MOVE, SAYING IT'S A STEP FRANCE IS TAKING TO REALLY MAKE CLEAR ITS STEADFAST SUPPORT FOR WOMEN'S RIGHTS. AND WE SHOULD POINT OUT THAT THE FRENCH ARE NOT DOING THIS IN A VACUUM EVEN THOUGH, THERE WAS NO LIKELY THREAT TO ABORTION RIGHTS IN FRANCE FROM THE COURTS OR FROM LAWMAKERS OR ANYONE ELSE. THIS IS A REACTION TO WHAT THE US SUPREME COURT DID IN 2022 IN OVERTURNING ROE V WADE. IN THE WAKE OF THAT SUPREME COURT DECISION, WE SAW A NUMBER OF FRENCH LAWMAKERS COMING OUT, MAKING CLEAR THAT THEY WANTED TO STAND NOT ONLY OPPOSED TO THE DECISION, BUT TO SIGNAL THAT WOMEN'S RIGHTS ARE NOT SOMETHING TO SIMPLY BE LEGISLATED, DEBATED OVER TIME OR POTENTIALLY REVERSED. SOMETHING THAT THEY WANTED TO MAKE CLEAR WAS A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT, AND NOW PUTTING IT IN THE FRENCH CONSTITUTION >>. JOSH LEDERMAN, THANK YOU SO MUCH. >>>. AND BEFORE WE GO, IT'S TIME FOR THE FUTURE OF EVERYTHING. POLICE IN RHODE ISLAND ARE USING A NEW PHONE APP TO HELP SAVE LIVES. WE'LL TELL YOU WHY YOU MIGHT >>>. THERE'S A NEW APP, THAT'S >>>.

IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU ARE IN AN EMERGENCY CALL OR TEXT YOUR WHAT THREE WORDS FROM THE APP DIRECTLY TO THE 911 COMMUNICATOR. THE 911 OPERATOR CAN EVEN SEND YOU A LINK >>. WE'LL ASK THEM TO HIT ALLOW, ALLOW. THE APP WILL THEN GIVE THREE WORDS. THE THREE WORDS >>. Reporter. THE 911 OPERATOR TYPES IN THE WORDS AND THE. THE PERSON'S LOCATION WILL POP UP ON THE SCREEN. >>. THEY COULD BE OUT IN AREAS WHERE PEOPLE MIGHT NOT KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THEY ARE. WE CAN USE THIS TECHNOLOGY TO GET THE FIRST RESPONDERS' HAND ON A PATIENT QUICKER >>. SOMEONE WAS STRANDED IN A BOAT AND THEY WERE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE LIKE THE NAVY USES.

DONALD TRUMP HAS MADE NO EFFORT TO REACH OUT OR SOMEHOW TEMPER HIS STYLE OR CHANGE HIS POLICY POSITIONS IN SUCH A WAY AS TO APPEAL TO THAT SECTION OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WHO HASN'T SUPPORTED HIM TO THE DEGREE HAS MADE THIS A FOCAL POINT. ALL HE HAS DONE IT ALMOST ENTIRELY THROUGH THE LENS OF ALLOWING JOE BIDEN TO PUSH SOME REPUBLICANS BACK INTO HIS ORBIT. I ASKED HIM ABOUT THIS ALL THE WAY BACK DURING THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY. HERE'S WHAT HE TOLD ME THEN, AND IT'S STILL OPERABLE NOW. >> HOW DO YOU BRING THEM BACK IN? >>. THERE GOING TO ALTHOUGH FOR ME AGAIN, EVERYBODY. I'M NOT SURE WE NEED TO MANY. I'M NOT SURE. I THINK BIDEN IS THE WORST PRESIDENT IN HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY. BUT THEY ARE ALL COMING BACK. I THINK YOU SEE THAT HERE>>. AS WE GET INTO MARCH 2, THINGS ARE STILL TRUE. NUMBER ONE, THE BIDEN PART OF NUMBER ONE, THE BIDEN PART OF THIS WORK. TO HIS ADVANTAGE OF, HE WILL PUSH VOTERS BACK INTO DONALD TRUMP'S CAMP. THE OTHER PART OF THIS IS THEY DON'T THINK THIS IS AS BIG OF A PROBLEM AS THE DATA THAT YOU JUST SHOWED MIGHT INDICATE. THEY LOOK AT SWING STATE POLLS THAT STILL SHOW DONALD TRUMP COMFORTABLY HAD OF JOE BIDEN AND THINK THAT PERHAPS THEY DON'T NEED AS MANY OF THESE NIKKI HALEY VOTERS BACK AS YOU OR I MIGHT BELIEVE >>. YEAH, ESSENTIALLY A RISKY BET. WE WILL SEE. YOU HAVE ALSO GOT. COME AS WE TALK ABOUT THE GENERAL ELECTION, 244 DAYS AWAY, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS THE HALLMARK OF THE FALL PRE-ELECTION IS, TYPICALLY, DEBATES BETWEEN TWO CANDIDATES IN LAST COUPLE OF HOURS, AND THIS HAS BEEN AN OPEN QUESTION SINCE DONALD TRUMP DIDN'T DO ANY OF THE RIEMER DEBATES. SOUNDS LIKE MAYBE HE WOULD DO ONE WITH PRESIDENT BIDEN. TALK ESTER IT >>. YEAH, NOT JUST MAYBE. ACCORDING TO THIS TRUTH SOCIAL POST, HE SAID HE'S READY TO DO DEBATES ANYTIME, ANYWHERE, ANYPLACE >> MAR-A-LAGO >> INCLUDING ON MSNBC OR ON THE COMMISSION OF PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES WHICH, IRONICALLY, COME THE REPUBLICAN PARTY VOTED TO BOYCOTT IN 2022 AT DONALD TRUMP'S DIRECTION. IT SHOWS YOU THE WAY THE POLITICAL WIND HAS CHANGED HERE. THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND DONALD TRUMP FEELS LIKE ONE-ON-ONE AGAINST JOE BIDEN. HE PUTS ON THE BETTER SHOWING. I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE PRESENT, WHO HAS NOT TO BE DISSIPATING IN ANY DEBATE. BY SUGGESTING THEY TO DO THIS NOW AND WOULD OFTEN, THEY MAY BE LEAVING THEIR OWN HYPE TOO MUCH BECAUSE MOST MIGHT ULTIMATELY FIND OUT WHETHER. NOT THEY THINK THE PRESENT WILL BE A WEAKER DEBATER THAN DONALD TRUMP, I WILL SAY HISTORICALLY INCOMING PRESENCE ALMOST, ALWAYS SOMETHING THAT FIRST DEBATE. IT MAY BE A GOOD TACTICAL RISK HERE I DONALD TRUMP, TO FORCE THIS ISSUE NOW >>. WATCHING FROM A PERCH NEAR PALM BEACH- GARRETT, THANK YOU. ALLIE VITELLI IS ALSO PURGED IN CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA PERHAPS, FOR THE LAST NIGHT, AFTER MONTHS OF FOLLOWING NIKKI HALEY ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. WHAT HAS BEEN INTERESTING HAS BEEN THIS QUESTION- WHAT HER TONE WOULD BE FOR YOU AND I WORKED TOGETHER ON A SPECIAL REPORT. EARLIER AS SHE WAS MAKING THAT ANNOUNCEMENT, SHE CONGRATULATED DONALD TRUMP. SHE TALKED ABOUT BEING A CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN. WHAT SHE DIDN'T SAY WAS: HEY, EVERYBODY WHO SUPPORTED ME, GO OUT AND SUPPORT THE ARMOR PRESIDENT. SHE ENCOURAGED PEOPLE TO MAKE UP THEIR OWN MINDS ABOUT IT >>. IT SEEMS LIKE SHE IS STILL KIND OF MAKING A PURSE WITH THE OTHER HALF OF THAT SENTENCE WAS WHEN SHE SAID I'M A CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN. THE NEXT THING SHE SAYS WAS I WAS BACK TO THE PARTY'S NOMINEE AND THEN SHE DIDN'T BACK THE PARTY'S NOMINEE. THIS MIGHT BE A CLUE AS TO WHY, THOUGH THIS LIST OF POLICY THINGS THAT SHE HAS DIFFERENT WITH DONALD TRUMP WATCH >>. A SMALLER FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS NOT ONLY NECESSARY FOR OUR FREEDOM, IT IS NECESSARY FOR OUR SURVIVAL. TERM LIMITS FOR WASHINGTON POLITICIANS ARE NEEDED NOW MORE THAN EVER. STANDING BY OUR ALLIES IN UKRAINE, ISRAEL AND TAIWAN IS A MORAL IMPERATIVE >>. IT'S THAT LAST ONE HALLE THAT I THINK IS SO IMPORTANT. THE WAY THAT NIKKI HALEY HAS REALLY A BREAK FROM THE FOREIGN POLICY PERSPECTIVE, EVEN AS THOSE IN HER OWN REPUBLICAN PARTY BACK WAKE FROM CONTINUED AID LIKE TO ALLIES, LIKE UKRAINE EIGHT ISRAEL CUT UP ANOTHER THORNY POLITICS ISSUES. THE FACT THAT HALEY HAS BEEN CLEAR WRITING CONSISTENT THEIR MIXER VERY DIFFERENT THAN HER FORMER BOSS, WHO HAS NOT HAD MUCH TO SAY, IF ANYTHING NEGATIVE, ABOUT VLADIMIR PUTIN. HE EVEN IN THE WAKE OF THE MURDER OF HIS POLITICAL DISSIDENTS AND TOP POLITICAL CRITIC IN RUSSIA, ALEXEI NAVALNY, JUST WEEKS AGO. FOR HALEY, THOSE ARE KEY DIFFERENCES IN MY EXPLAIN: THE LACK OF ENDORSEMENT, THE QUESTIONS. WE LAY THIS OUT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SHOW. WHAT HAPPENS? NIKKI HALEY IS NOT GETTING THE MAJORITY OF THE REPUBLICAN ELECTRIC. THAT'S WHY SHE'S NOT IN THE RACE ANYMORE. SHE DIDN'T GET ZERO. THERE WASN'T MUCH, BUT THERE WAS SOME SLIVER OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WHO BACKED HER EVEN. THOUGH WE TALKED ABOUT GARRETT SINGH. THERE'S AN OPEN QUESTION AS TO HOW MUCH THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN FEELS LIKE THEY NEED TO EXTEND ANY OLIVE BRANCHES TO THAT SLICE. WE KNOW BRANCHES TO THAT SLICE. WE KNOW THAT THIS IS ANY SIMILARITIES TO 2020, IT'S GOING TO BE CLOSE, SUPER CLOSE. MARGINS ARE SUPERTIGHT, WHICH IS WHY SOME OF THESE SUBURBAN WOMEN IN KEY SWING STATES MATTER THE VERY FOLKS WHO SEEMED TO FAVOR NIKKI HALEY IN SOME OF THESE EARLY PRIMARIES. LET ME PLAY A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT THESE VOTERS TOLD YOU. OUR TEAM OTHERS WATCH >>. THAT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION. IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE BIDEN >>. I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED WITH TRUMP BUT AT THE SAME TIME, IF IT'S BETWEEN TRUMP AND BIDEN, I WOULD PROBABLY VOTE FOR TRUMP. >> DIVIDED BUT ALSO RELUCTANT, WHICH SPEAKS TO THE IDEA THAT THE OTHER CHALLENGER HERE, IN A DONALD TRUMP, JOE BIDEN SET UP, IS VOTER APATHY >>. WHAT IF THEY STAY HOME? FRANKLY? I HAVE HEARD FROM THOSE VOTERS WHO LOATHE HAVING TO MAKE THIS CHOICE AND ALSO, SO MAYBE I JUST DON'T MAKE IT. MAYBE I VOTE DOWN BALLOT, MAYBE I JUST STAY HOME. WHEN YOU LOOK AT STATES LIKE WISCONSIN OR MICHIGAN OR, ESPECIALLY, GEORGIA, WHICH BIDEN WAS ABLE TO FLIP, WE KNOW THAT THESE ARE STATES THAT TURN ON TENS OF THOUSANDS OF BALLOTS. THAT IS NOT A LOT OF BALLOTS, SO FOR PEOPLE TO SAY THEY ARE STAYING HOME. THAT WOULD CERTAINLY IMPACT THE TURNOUT QUESTION AND COULD IMPACT THE WAY THAT THESE STATES GO. IT COULD ALSO BE IMPACTFUL IF YOU ARE TRUMP AND YOU ARE LOSING VOTES FROM WOULD BE REPUBLICANS. THAT COULD BE ENOUGH TO HELP BIDEN, FOR BOTH PARTIES ARE SORT OF FIGHTING. THIS APATHY QUESTIONED RIGHT NOW AND HALEY SUPPORTERS ARE IN FRONT OF THAT PACK. >> ALLIE VITELLI, LIVE IN SOUTH CAROLINA. WHERE TO GO? NEXT, NEXT, YOU KNOW YET. >> TO MY BED TO SLEEP. >> ENJOY, YOU DESERVE IT. >>. THANK YOU, ALLEY. >> APPRECIATE ALL YOU, YOUR COVERAGE AND THANK YOU TO YOUR TEAM AS WELL. >>>. NOW TO THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES NOMINEE. WE SHOULD SAY PRESIDENT BIDEN GETTING READY TO MAKE A RESPONSE TO MR, TO MAKE A RESPONSE TO MR TRUMP'S SUPER TUESDAY NEAR SWEEP AT TOMORROW'S STATE OF THE UNION. LOOK AT THIS GRAPHIC. THESE ARE ALL. THESE ARE THE TOP 100. LIVE BROADCAST LAST YEAR. SEE ALL OF THOSE FOOTBALLS. IT WAS LIKE: ALL SPORTS ALMOST, EXCEPT FOR THREE THINGS: THE OSCARS, THE THANKSGIVING DAY PARADE. YOU SEE IT THERE. AND SEE THAT LITTLE ICON, THE STATE OF THE UNION. THAT LITTLE FLAG ON THE 21st. IT'S A BIG DEAL. RIGHT THERE'S A LOT OF EYEBALLS ON THIS. FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN, OUR TEAMS REPORTING LOT OF HIS MESSAGE WILL BOIL DOWN. TO WHOSE SIDE. ARE YOU ON>> TO HEAR A LOT ABOUT THE QUESTIONS ABOUT IMMIGRATION AND THE BORDER, THE ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR, ALL OF IT, PART OF WHAT THE PRESIDENT SEES NOT AS A ONE NIGHT PRIME TIME EVENT BUT SOMETHING THAT LEADS UP TO A FULL ON FLOOD. THIS A MOMENT FOR HIS MESSAGE. KELLY O'DONNELL IS OUTSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE. FOR US, KELLY, THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE WHITE HOUSE. THE PRESIDENT, THESE MANY EYEBALLS, PERHAPS TO PUSH BACK TO ONE OF THE BIG VOTER CONCERNS ABOUT HIM COMING INTO NOVEMBER, WHICH IS HIS AGE, HIS FITNESS FOR OFFICE HERE. I'M INTERESTED TO SEE HOW YOU. I'M INTERESTED TO SEE HOW YOU MIGHT RESPOND ALL OF LAST YEAR TO AND HECKLING FROM THE ROOM. I KNEW WHEN THE TEAM HAVE SOME NEW REPORTING ON THAT AND A WHOLE BUNCH OF OTHER NUGGETS LEADING UP TO TOMORROW NIGHT. TALK US THROUGH IT >>. CERTAINLY HALLE, WHEN THE PRESIDENT KNOWS HE'S IN FRONT OF A ROOM IN WHICH INCLUDES HUNDREDS OF MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, AND WE KNOW THAT SORT OF THE DECORUM IN THE CHAMBER HAS LOOSENED UP TO PUT IT POLITELY OVER THE YEARS. IT COULD BE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WHO COULD HECKLE. IT COULD BE THOSE WHO ARE ATTENDING IN THE GALLERY. THERE ARE GUESTS OF EACH MEMBER OF CONGRESS AND SENATORS WHO ARE INVITED TO WITNESS THIS EXTRAORDINARY EVENT OF SEEING A STATE OF THE UNION IN PERSON. THERE MIGHT BE ON EITHER THE FAR RIGHT OR THE FAR LEFT- ON ISSUES AS WIDE-RANGING AS THE CEASE-FIRE DEMANDS IN GAZA TO IMMIGRATION AND THE BORDER. YOU CAN SEE HECKLING SO CLEARLY THE PRESENT AS PART OF HIS PREPARATION, WITH A SMALL GROUP OF SENIOR ADVISERS SPENDING TIME AT CAMP DAVID WORKING THROUGH ITERATIONS OF THE DRAFT AND PART OF IT, IS ANTICIPATING WHAT MIGHT BE SAID, WHAT MIGHT COME UP AND HOW BEST TO TRY TO RESPOND TO THAT. IN MANY WAYS, THE BIDEN, ADMINISTRATION, THE TEAM AROUND THE PRESIDENT WOULD SORT OF WELCOME ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS, BECAUSE THEY FELT THAT WHAT HAPPENED LAST YEAR, WITH SOME CALLING OUT RELATED TO SOCIAL SECURITY, GAVE THE PRESIDENT A MOMENT TO SHOW COMMAND OF THE ROOM, TO ALMOST NEGOTIATE IN REAL TIME WITH REPUBLICANS, TO AGREE, TO KNOW CUTS ON SOCIAL SECURITY AND HAVE A BIT OF A WIN IN THAT MOMENT BY PERCEPTION, BY DEMONSTRATING HIS AGILITY AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. SO THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY ALONG WITH PERIL WHEN IT COMES TO PREPARING FOR HECKLERS >>. I HAVE LIKE 90 MILLION MORE QUESTIONS FOR YOU IN A 90 MILLION MORE MINUTES. LET ME TAKE YOU THROUGH A COUPLE OF THEM. WE KNOW A POLICY. THERE'S A LOT OF INTERESTING TOPICS HERE. REPUBLICANS HAVE MADE IMMIGRATION FRONT AND CENTER IN IMMIGRATION FRONT AND CENTER IN THEIR 2024 PUSH TALKING TO THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN. THEY ALSO WANT FLIP THE SCRIPT ON IMMIGRATION AND TRY TO GET REPUBLICANS BACK ON THEIR HEELS AFTER CONGRESS FAILED TO PASS ANY MEANINGFUL GRATIAN REFORM >>. EXPECT TO HEAR THAT THE PRESENT WILL PUSH BACK TO SAY THE NECESSARY STEPS FOR, SAY THE NECESSARY STEPS FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER SECURITY REQUIRE FUNDING THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE BY CONGRESS TO PAY FOR THE BORDER PATROL AGENTS, TO PAY FOR MORE JUDGES, FOR ASYLUM COURTS AND SO FORTH. HE IS GOING TO SAY HE IS EXHAUSTED EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY. THEY DON'T PLAN TO UNVEIL ANY UNILATERAL STEPS. IT'S CONGRESS WHO HAS TO PASS THE MONEY AND THE POLICY TO GET IT DONE >>. KELLY VERY QUICKLY. WE TALKED ABOUT FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP, THIS IDEA THAT HE MAY WANT TO DEBATE PRESIDENT BIDEN, THIS IDEA THAT HE'S GOING TO BE WATCHING IN REAL TIME TOMORROW NIGHT. TEAM BIDEN SEEMS TO BE HEY, BRING IT ON. IF YOU'RE SO THIRSTY, JUST DO THAT. TALK US THROUGH THAT. >>. THEY RECOGNIZE THESE IN A MOMENT. MOMENTS CAN BE VERY HELPFUL. THEY ARE ALSO RISKY. THERE ARE HIGH STAKES. THEY WANT TO TALK -- DROP THE FORMER PRESIDENT AND SET UP THIS CONTEST AS A DIVIDE THAT HAS UNFOLDED NOW OF A REMATCH ELECTION, IN A NEW MOMENT WHERE THEY BELIEVE THEY CAN ARGUE THAT JOE BIDEN, EVEN IF YOU DON'T AGREE ON ALL OF HIS POLICIES, IS STILL THE SOUNDER CHOICE, THE BETTER CHOICE, AND SO THEY BELIEVE THAT TINGLING WITH THE FORMER PRESIDENT WILL REVEAL MORE OF WHAT MAKES ESPECIALLY ELUSIVE VOTERS UNSETTLED ABOUT HIM. KELLY >>. KELLY O'DONNELL, EXHIBIT HE ZIPPING THROUGH IT ALL FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. FOR US, THANK YOU >>>. NOW TO THE MIDDLE EAST, WITH DEVELOPING NEWS OUT OF THERE WE ARE LEARNING. HOUTHI REBELS HAVE KILLED AT LEAST TWO SAILORS IN A MISSILE ATTACK ON COMMERCIAL SHIPS. TODAY, THE FIRST TIME ANYONE HAS BEEN KILLED IN THE REBEL ATTACK SINCE THEY STARTED TARGETING SHIPS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WAR, RAISING POSSIBILITY. NOW AMERICAN TROOPS COULD RESPOND WITH YET ANOTHER ROUND OF STRIKES ON THE REBELS. COURTNEY QB IS FOLLOWING THIS ONE. FOR US, THE QUESTION: WHAT COULD THE RESPONSE BE? NOW THAT LIVES HAVE BEEN LOST. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THIS SITUATION, IN THIS CONFLICT >>, WE HAVE SEEN A SERIES OF ESCALATING RESPONSES FRANKLY. FROM THE FIRST TIME, THE US AND THE BRITISH MILITARY CAME TOGETHER AND CONDUCTED A ROUND OF AIR STRIKES INSIDE YEMEN. WE SAW ANOTHER ROUND OF THOSE JUST RECENTLY. US OFFICIALS HERE AT THE PENTAGON ARE SAYING YES, THEY ARE LOOKING AT OPTIONS FOR A RESPONSE. THE REALITY IS, HALLE, THERE'S ALSO A GROWING FRUSTRATION ABOUT THE FACT THAT THIS CONTINUING THESE AIR STRIKES, INCLUDING THE ONES THAT ARE OCCURRING ON A NEAR DAILY BASIS, THESE SO-CALLED DYNAMIC OR SELF DEFENSE STRIKES THAT THE US MILITARY IS TAKING EVERY SINGLE DAY. THEY DON'T SEEM TO BE DETERRING THE HOUTHIS. WE HAVE SEEN FIVE. HOUTHI IS LESS -- MISSILE ATTACKS AGAINST SHIPS- ONE HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY THAT KILLED TWO MARINER -- MARINERS- AND KILLED SIX -- INJURED OTHERS INJURED OTHERS THERE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE. THIS IS GOING TO BE A LONG-TERM PROCESS, BOTH TO DETER THE HOUTHI ATTACKS AND TO DEGRADE THEIR CAPABILITIES TO CARRY THEM OUT. THEM OUT >>. WHAT MATT MILLER JUST SAID ABOUT DEGRADING THEIR CAPABILITIES. THAT'S ONE OF THE BIG CHALLENGES HERE, HALLE. THE US DOESN'T HAVE A REALLY GOOD SENSE OF EXACTLY WHAT THE HOUTHIS HAVE IN THEIR ARSENAL REMEMBER. BEFORE NOVEMBER, THE US WASN'T REALLY PAYING A LOT OF ATTENTION TO THE HOUTHIS. THEY WERE NOT CONDUCTING THESE SORTS OF ATTACKS AGAINST A MARITIME ENVIRONMENT. NOW, THE WEST DOESN'T HAVE A REALLY STRONG BASELINE OF WHAT ALL THEY HAVE IN THEIR ARSENAL. THAT JUST MAKES THIS ALL THE MORE CHALLENGING. >> COURTNEY, LIVE AT THE PENTAGON, THANK YOU. >>> DOWN SOUTH RIGHT NOW ALABAMA LAWMAKERS ARE WORKING TO GET A BILL ON THE GOVERNOR'S DESK BY THE END OF THE DAY TO GET STATE IVF CLINICS OPEN AGAIN. YOU ARE LOOKING LIVE AT THE LEGISLATIVE SESSIONS THAT JUST STARTED THE SENATE IN THE LAST HOUR, THE STATE HOUSE- IN THE LAST 20 MINUTES THIS BILL WERE PROTECT FERTILITY CLINICS FROM LAWSUITS. AFTER THAT CONTROVERSIAL RULING BY THE ALABAMA SUPREME COURT, FROZEN EMBRYOS HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS AS CHILDREN STILL. SOME LAWYERS SAY THE BILL AS WRITTEN JUST DOESN'T DO ENOUGH -- BURNS IS COVERING THIS ONE LIVE FOR US FROM MONTGOMERY. ALABAMA TONIGHT EXPLAINED THAT PIECE OF WHAT THE BILL DOES AND DOES NOT DO AND WHAT YOUR HEARING FROM FOLKS ON THE GROUND >>. THE BILL IS BEING DEBATED ON THE HOUSE FLOOR RIGHT NOW AS WE. >>. WHAT THIS BILL DOES DO IS PROTECT CLINICS IN THE PROVIDERS- BASICALLY ALL THE FOLKS INVOLVED IN IVF TREATMENT- FROM LEGAL LIABILITY, CRIMINAL AND CIVIL LIABILITY, AND THAT MEANS THAT IF THIS WILL PASSES TONIGHT OR TOMORROW, THAT CLINICS WILL BE ABLE TO REOPEN. THERE ARE FAMILIES THAT HAVE BEEN ON ALERT FOR WEEKS NOW BEEN ON ALERT FOR WEEKS NOW AFTER THIS DECISION CAME OUT. I HAVE BEEN TALKING TO LAWMAKERS HERE. DEMOCRATIC LAWMAKERS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THIS BILL. THEY ARE WILLING TO VOTE FOR IT BUT THEY ARE NOT IN FULL VOTING. SUPPORT, TAKE A LISTEN>>. I WILL SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE OUR FAMILIES HERE NEED TO HAVE IMMEDIATE RELIEF. IT'S LIKE PUTTING A BAND-AID ON A HEMORRHAGING WOUND. IT'S NOT ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE THAT AN EMBRYO IS NOT A CHILD >>. THAT'S THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION HERE IS: WILL THIS BILL BE ENOUGH, GIVEN THAT THE RULING AND THE STATE'S CONSTITUTION STILL HAS THIS CLAUSE IN IT, SAYING THAT EMBRYOS ARE PEOPLE HALLE >>. -- BURNS LIVE FOR US. THANK YOU SO MUCH. >>>. TONIGHT, OFFICIALS ARE SHOWING MORE ABOUT THAT HUGE FIRE IN MICHIGAN, THE ONE THAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE ON THE SCREEN. I WANT TO SHOW YOU THE EXPLOSIONS COMING OUT OF THIS PLANT, LITERALLY SHAKING HOUSES NEARBY. DO YOU SEE THAT HORRIFIC RAINING DOWN DEBRIS ON MONDAY? POLICE SAY THIS WAS ALL HAPPENING AT A VAPE DISTRIBUTION FACILITY THAT HAD BEEN ILLEGALLY STORING COMBUSTIBLE GAS CANISTERS, ONE OF WHICH APPARENTLY HIT 19- YEAR-OLD TURNER SALTER, EVENTUALLY KILLING HIM. OFFICIALS: A SALTER WAS IN A NEARBY CAR WASH WATCHING ALL THIS, ALL OF THE COMMOTION AS IT HAPPEN. NOW CREWS ARE THERE AT THE SCENE. YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THE AFTERMATH HERE. CLEANUP IS. OFFICIALS WARN THAT SOME OF THE DEBRIS COULD STILL BE DANGEROUS AND STILL POTENTIALLY BE EXPLOSIVE. THE QUESTION WE ARE TRYING TO ANSWER. WHAT CAME FIRST AT THIS PLANT? WAS IT THE FIRE OR THE EXPLOSION EXPLOSION? WE HAVE SHOWN THE PICTURES AND YOU CAN'T OVERSTATE HOW DRAMATIC THIS WAS. SOME OF THESE EXPLOSIVE CANISTERS WENT FLYING SOMETHING LIKE A MILE. IT'S STILL DANGEROUS. YOUR THIS SITE TALK TO US ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED AND WHERE THE INVESTIGATION GOES NOW. >>. Reporter. THE LATEST INFORMATION IS UP TO TWO MILES AWAY. THAT'S HOW FAR THAT DEBRIS WAS SCATTERED IN. THE WARNING FOR RESIDENTS HERE IS: IF YOU SEE ONE OF THOSE CANISTERS, DON'T TOUCH IT, DON'TPICK IT UP, BECAUSE IT COULD STILL EXPLODE. WE HAVE SEEN SMALL FIRES RE- EMERGING HERE THROUGHOUT THE DAY. INVESTIGATORS ARE HOPING THAT THEY CAN GET ON THIS SITE FULLY SO THEY CAN START THE NEXT STEP TO PINPOINT. WHAT HAPPENED? WHAT LED TO THAT SERIES OF EXPLOSIONS? WE TALKED ABOUT THOSE FLYING CANISTERS IN THE FLYING DEBRIS. THAT IS WHAT HIT THE 19-YEAR OLD TURNER IN HIS HEAD. HIS FUNERAL IS PLANNED FOR THIS FRIDAY. HE WILL BE REMEMBERED AS A TEEN WHO WAS KIND AND SERVED AT HIS CHURCH, MEANWHILE. PEOPLE BACK HERE IN THE COMMUNITY ARE STILL TALKING ABOUT WHAT THEY SAW. >>. WHAT I FELT WAS THE WHOLE WORLD, THE EARTHSHAKING WORLD. THE EARTHSHAKING IT WAS PRETTY, BAD AND SCARY. IT NEVER STOPPED. IT NEVER STOPPED. THE EXPLOSIONS NEVER STOPPED. >>. Reporter. WHAT WAS EXPLODING? HALLE? THOSE CANISTERS WHICH CONTAINED BUTANE, AT LEAST HALF REMAINED AFTER. THE BUSINESS OWNERS HERE HAD JUST RECEIVED RECENTLY A SHIPMENT, A SEMI LOAD. ALSO, INSIDE OF A BACK ROOM, ACCORDING TO CITY OFFICIALS, WAS A PALLET OF NITROUS OXIDE ALONG WITH LIGHTER FLUID. AUTHORITIES TELLING US THIS WHILE IT'S GONE NOW. BUT THE BUILDING THAT WAS HERE BEFORE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A RETAIL OPERATION. HALLE >>. ADRIAN LIVE IN MICHIGAN, THANK YOU. >>>. OUT OF NEW MEXICO, JURORS ARE NOW DELIBERATING THE REST SHOOTING CASE. AFTER, PROSECUTORS TOLD THEM FILMING WAS GAME OF RUSSIAN ROULETTE. EVERY TIME AN ACTOR HAD A GUN, LISTEN>>. I'M NOT TELLING YOU THAT HANNIGAN TERRACE INTENDED TO BRING LIVE ROUNDS ONSET, BUT I'M TELLING YOU SHE WAS NEGLIGENT, SHE WAS CARELESS, SHE WAS THOUGHTLESS >>. IT HAS BEEN A DRAMATIC TRIAL AND AN EMOTIONAL TRIAL. WE ARE NOW OFFICIALLY ON VERDICT WATCH TONIGHT CENTERED AROUND THE WOMAN. YOU SEE HER HANNIGAN TERRACE READ. THIS IS HER IN COURT TODAY. SHE'S THE ONE WHO LOADED THE GUN THAT WENT OFF IN ALEC BALDWIN TAN ON OCTOBER 21st 2021, WHICH LED TO THE DEATH OF HELENA HUTCHINS. NOW IT'S UP TO THE JURY TO DECIDE IF YOU, TERRACE READ, WAS TO BLAME FOR NOT BEING MORE, TO BLAME FOR NOT BEING MORE CAREFUL IF YOU FIND HER GUILTY OF INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER, OF TAMPERING WITH EVIDENCE SHE COULD FACE YEARS IN PRISON. DAVID GRIFFIN IS COVERING THIS FROM SANTA FE, NEW MEXICO. WE TALK ABOUT THE PROSECUTION'S DEFENSES -- CLOSING ARGUMENTS. THE DEFENSE DRILL DOWN ON THE FACT THAT THE JURY HAS TO BE SURE THAT COULD TERRACE READ WAS RESPONSIBLE WITHOUT -- WITHOUT A REASONABLE DOUBT. HOW DO THEY THREAD THAT NEEDLE? THE PROSECUTOR HAS YET TO SHOW ANY DIRECT EVIDENCE OF HOW AND WHEN THOSE LIVE ROUNDS FOUND THEIR WAY ONSET. THEY BLAMED ACTOR ALEC BALDWIN FOR PULLING THE TRIGGER, STATING THAT THE SCENE, THAT SCRIPT SPECIFICALLY DID NOT CALL FOR HIM TO DRAW HIS WEAPON. THEY BLAMED THE SUPPLIER OF THAT AMMO AND THE INVESTIGATORS FOR NOT DOING A SEARCH WARRANT UNTIL A MONTH AFTER THE SHOOTING. THEY SAY THE SUPPLIER COULD HAVE THROWN AWAY EVIDENCE. AND THEY HAVE ALSO CITED MULTIPLE TIMES THAT OSHA REPORT THAT FOUND FAULT WITH THE PRODUCTION RUST, PRODUCTION AND MANAGEMENT FOR SEVERAL SAFETY FAILURES THROUGHOUT THAT ENTIRE FILMING SESSION. LISTEN >>. THE BUCK STOPS WITH PRODUCTION. AS IN ANY ORGANIZATION, IT STARTS AT THE TOP. YOU'VE GOT A CONVENIENT FALL PERSON, YET A CONVENIENT SCAPEGOAT. SHE MAY NOT BE THE ARMOR ON SOME DAYS- SHE'S A PROPS PERSON- BUT SHE IS CERTAINLY THE ARMOR WHEN EVERYTHING GOES BAD. >>. THE PROSECUTION ADDED: SHE WAS NOT THE FALL PERSON, SHE WAS THE PERSON WHO DID NOT DO HER JOB. SHE ALSO AGREED: YOU'RE RIGHT, HANNIGAN TERRACE. THREE DID NOT KNOW SHE WAS LOADING A LIVE ROUND. BECAUSE THE PROSECUTOR SAYS, HAD SHE KNOWN, SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN CHARGED WITH MURDER HALLE. >>. WHAT IS THE TIMELINE NOW? WHAT IS THE EXPECTATION FOR HOW QUICKLY WE MAY SEE A VERDICT FROM THE JURY? I KNOW THAT'S -- BUT WHAT IS YOUR SENSE? >> WE CAN LITERALLY HAVE A VERDICT BY TODAY. WE JUST GOT WORD THAT THE JURY HAS A QUESTION, SO NOT A VERDICT BUT THEY HAVE CALLED COUNSEL BACK IN. OUR PRODUCER HAS GONE INTO. TRY TO LISTEN IN. MAYBE WE CAN UPDATE YOU NEXT HOUR, MAYBE ON WHAT THAT QUESTION WAS AND MAYBE A SENSE OF HOW CLOSE THEY ARE TO COMING TO A VERDIC. >>. THAT'S SUPER INTERESTING. DANA GRIFFIN, THANK YOU FOR BEING THERE. WE WILL LOOK FOR THAT UPDATE COMING UP THE NEXT HOUR. >>> A LOT MORE TO GET TO, INCLUDING NEW BACKLASH AGAINST DORITOS. THAT IS HINTING BUT I BOYCOTT. >>> CROSS -- PLUS COST AMERICAN TAXPAYERS $1 MILLION A MONTH. THE FUTURE IS NOW. NEWS FOR THE GENERATION OF NOW. NEWS FOR THE GENERATION OF NOW IS NBC NEWS NOW. >>> ELON MUSK PUTTING TO BED SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT WHO HE IS SUPPORTING THE 2024 ELECTION, AND IT LOOKS LIKE NOBODY, AT LEAST WHEN IT COMES TO DOLLARS. IN A POST TODAY ON HIS PLATFORM X MUSK WROTE: JUST BE SUPER CLEAR: I'M NOT DONATING MONEY TO EITHER CANDIDATE FOR US PRESIDENT. KIND OF HAD TO SAY THIS AFTER. HE WAS SPOTTED THAT MAR-A-LAGO THIS PAST WEEKEND, ACCORDING TO THE NEW YORK TIMES GO. THE WHOLE THING RAISED A BUNCH OF QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER MUSK. I BE PUTTING HIS SUPPORT AND PERHAPS SOME OF HIS NEARLY $200 BILLION NET WORTH BEHIND THE FORMER PRESIDENT, WHO IS VERY MUCH LOOKING FORECAST NBC NEWS BUSINESS AND DATA CORRESPONDENT, BRIAN CHEUNG, IS JOINING US NOW. EVEN IF MUSK DOESN'T MAKE ANY DIRECT LOCATIONS, THE LANGUAGE IS INTERESTING IN HIS POST. THAT'S RIGHT. THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF THINGS IN CAMPAIGNS YOU CAN DONATE MONEY TO. STILL, HE HAS A LOT OF WAYS. IF STILL, HE HAS A LOT OF WAYS. IF YOU WANT TO COME TO PUT A FINGER ON THIS COME NOVEMBER >>, HE'S ONE OF THE WEALTHIEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD. IF HE SAYS HE'S NOT GOING TO COMMIT MONEY, THERE ARE CERTAINLY OTHER WAYS. HE COULD PUT HIS THUMB ON THE SCALE. THAT'S BECAUSE OF HIS MASSIVE INFLUENCE. HE OWNS THE X, FORMALLY KNOWN AS TWITTER PLATFORM, WITH 175 MILLION FOLLOWERS, EVEN OUTSIDE OF THE PUBLIC, FACING ASPECT OF WHAT MUSK SAYS AND DOES. HE HAS MANY CONNECTIONS TO OTHER VERY WEALTHY PEOPLE. THIS IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE. WE KNOW HE HAS A RELATIONSHIP WITH KANYE WEST, WHO ALSO HAS A LOT OF MONEY. MONEY COULD GO TO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AS A RESULT OF HIS CONNECTIONS, EVEN IF IT DOESN'T COME FROM MUSK DIRECTLY. ALSO AGAIN, HE HAS BEEN TWEETING. CLEARLY. IT'S NOT A SURPRISE TO ANYONE HE SUPPORTS SURPRISE TO ANYONE. HE SUPPORTS THIS CANDIDATE OVER BIDEN. FOR THAT REASON, HE CAN CONTINUE TO SAY THINGS AND IN SOME CASES ALSO WHILE PERHAPS MISS INFORMATION ABOUT CERTAIN SITUATIONS, AS HE HAS DONE BEFORE TO PUT A THUMB ON HIS >>. RECENT NBC NEWS INVESTIGATION ON THAT MUSK IS WRAPPED UP IN AT LEAST 11 DIFFERENT REGULATORY BATTLES WITH THE GOVERNMENT. HE IS, IN SOME WAYS, UNIQUELY INVESTED IN WHO ENDS UP IN THE WHITE HOUSE >>. YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. HE RUNS MANY, MANY BUSINESSES. A LOT OF THEM HAVE BEEN WRAPPED UP IN REGULATORY ISSUES, WHICH MUSK HAS BEEN VERY CLEAR IN SAYING: HOLD HIM BACK, HE MIGHT BE IN FAVOR OF A CANDIDATE THAT IS GOING TO PAIR SOME OF THOSE RELATIONS BACK, AS TRUMP DID DURING 2016.. I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT MUSK ISN'T NECESSARILY ON BOARD ENTIRELY WITH ALL POLICIES REMEMBER THAT DEAL BOOK CONVERSATION HEATSHIELD WITH EARLIER THIS YEAR, WHERE HE DIDN'T GO WHOLEHEARTEDLY BEHIND TRUMP >>. COULD YOU SEE YOURSELF VOTING FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN? IF IT'S A BIDEN TRUMP ELECTION, FOR EXAMPLE, >> I THINK I WILL NOT VOTE FOR BIDEN. >>. WILL YOU VOTE FOR TRUMP? >> I'M NOT SAYING I WILL BE. >>. I'M NOT SAYING I WILL BE TRUMP. BUT OH, THIS IS A DIFFICULT CHOICE HERE. >>. A DIFFICULT CHOICE HERE. LOOK, WE HAVE DONE BASED OFF WHAT HE SAID SINCE, THAT HE WOULD SUPPORT TRUMP OVER BIDEN. WOULD SUPPORT TRUMP OVER BIDEN BUT YOU HAVE TO SEE THAT THAT LONG PAUSE WAS A LONG PAUSE. WHEN IT COMES TO THE OTHER TYPES OF POLICIES, THAT CERTAINLY DOES INTO THE FOLD BUT ON A REGULATORY BASIS. CERTAINLY HE WOULD PROBABLY PREFER THE FORMER PRESIDENT TO BIDEN. >>. 30,000 FOOT VIEW HERE. X COULD BE POWERFUL COME NOVEMBER. COULD BE POWERFUL COME NOVEMBER IN WAYS THAT ARE PERHAPS USEFUL: TWO CANDIDATES IN CAMPAIGNS AND WAYZATA PERHAPS DANGEROUS. WHEN IT COMES TO SOMETHING YOU ALLUDED TO, WHICH IS MISINFORMATION >> YEAH, WE HAVE TO REMEMBER HE HAS USED THIS PLATFORM PULL IT -- OR POLITICAL REASONS BEFORE, EVEN IF MUSK ISN'T THROWING MONEY BEHIND THE SCENES. WE HAVE TO MEMBER THIS PLATFORM HAS HAD A LOT OF BIG CHANGES SINCE HE TOOK IT PRIVATE NOT LONG AGO. AND THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT. EVEN IF HE HIMSELF IS GOING TO, YOU KNOW, USE IT TO SAY WHATEVER HE WANTS TO SAY. WHETHER OR NOT, HE'S GOING TO POLICE. OTHER MISINFORMATION THAT COULD COME FROM THE OTHER MILLIONS OF USERS ON THE PLATFORM. HERE'S A STANCE: WHEN IT COMES TO X'S POLICY ON SPECIFICALLY VOTING IN ENGAGEMENTS HE SAYS: YOU MAY NOT USE X'S SERVICES FOR THE PURPOSES OF MANIPULATING OR INTERFERING IN THE ELECTIONS OR OTHER CERVICAL -- OTHER CIVIL PROCESSES. THAT MEANS MISLEADING PEOPLE ABOUT HOW AND WHERE TO VOTE OR INCITING VIOLENCE DURING AN ELECTION. THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT ARE CODIFIED IN THE POLICY BUT ENFORCING IT OUT -- HALLEY IS A ENFORCING IT OUT -- HALLEY IS A WHOLE DIFFERENT QUESTION THERE'S NO SHAREHOLDERS TO ANSWER TO. THAT'S AN OKAY PROCESS FOR THIS MASSIVE SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANY. >>. MUSK IS REALLY IN THE DRIVERS SEAT ON. THAT WENT TO A GREAT DEGREE. THANK YOU SO MUCH. >>>. THE FIVE THINGS ARE TEAM THINKS. YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT TONIGHT NUMBER ONE PROSECUTORS DROPPING CHARGES TODAY IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT HOTEL, CALIFORNIA TRIAL WE TOLD YOU ABOUT. THAT MEANS THE CHARGES ARE BASICALLY GONE. THIS IS A TRIAL. THAT ORDER, THAT EAGLES HITS WERE STOLEN. A NEW EMAIL RAISED QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FAIRNESS. NUMBER TWO: THE GOVERNOR WAS TO SELL THIS MEGA YACHT. SEIZED FROM A RUSSIAN OLIGARCH A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO, WHEN I WAS TRYING TO PRESSURE RUSSIA TO BACK OFF UKRAINE. THE YACHT COST THE MILLION DOLLARS TO MAINTAIN A MONTH. THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT'S DONE WITH THE COSTS. NUMBER THREE: STARBUCKS SAYS IT'S LAYING OFF 2000 PEOPLE. THIS BUSINESS IS TOUGH, THEY SAY. SOME CUSTOMERS HAVE BOYCOTTED THE CHANGE SINCE THE START OF THE ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR. STARBUCKS SAYS THEY DO NOT HAVE A POLITICAL AGENDA. NUMBER FOUR: TARGET IS ROLLING OUT A PAID MEMBERSHIP PROGRAM THAT KIND OF LIKE AMAZON PRIME. THIS ONE IS CALLED TARGET CIRCLE 360.. IT WILL COST YOU $99 A YEAR BASICALLY. IT'S FREE SAME-DAY DELIVERY FOR ORDERS OVER $35, DELIVERED IN AS LITTLE AS AN HOUR, PLUS FREE TWO-DAY SHIPPING. IT LAUNCHES IN APRIL. NUMBER FIVE: TAKE A LOOK AT THIS, A RARE GRAY WHALE SPOTTED NEAR NANTUCKET. IF YOU THINK OH, THAT'S PRETTY COOL RESEARCHERS THINKS THEIR HEADS EXPLODED. THEY COULD EVEN. TAKE A GOOD ONE SAID MY BRAIN COULDN'T PROCESS WHAT I WAS SEEING, BECAUSE THESE WELLS HAVE BEEN EXTINCT FROM THE ATLANTIC FOR MORE THAN TO HUNDRED YEARS. WHALING THE ISSUE THERE, THIS ONE WILL IS BACK, MAYBE BECAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE, WITH LESS SEA ICE IN THE WELLS WAY. AS THEY MAKE THEIR WAY TO THAT PART OF THE ATLANTIC PRETTY COOL >>>. THIS NEW BACKLASH NOW AFTER. DORITOS SAYS IT'S CUTTING TIES WITH THE TRANSGENDER INFLUENCER IN SPAIN. THERE WAS A VIDEO PROMOTING DORITOS SPAIN. THAT IS NOW OFF THE PAGE. THE PARTNERSHIP PROMPTING HASHTAG WHAT CAUGHT DORITOS TO POP UP ALL OF HER RIGHT WING CIRCLES ON X, FORMALLY KNOWN AS TWITTER. HUDSON HAS NOT COMMENTED, BUT IN THE STATEMENT DORITOS PARENT COMPANY, PEPSICO SAYS IT ENDED THE RELATIONSHIP BECAUSE OF CONTROVERSIAL, DELETED TWEETS. SHE MADE ADDING. YOU SEE IT HERE. WE STRONGLY CONDEMN WORDS OR ACTIONS THAT PROMOTES VIOLENCE OR SEXISM OF ANY KIND. IF SOME OF THIS IS SOUNDING FAMILIAR TO YOU, MAYBE BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY SHADES OF THAT CONSERVATIVE BACKLASH. BUD LIGHT FACED FOR PARTNERING WITH TRANS-INFLUENCER DYLAN MULVANEY. REMEMBER KID ROCK SHOOTING BEER CANS- EVERYBODY WATCHED THE BRAND FALL FROM ITS NUMBER ONE. PERCH OR BARRETT IS FOLLOWING THIS ONE FOR US, SAME. SAME BUT DIFFERENT AS IT SAME. SAME BUT DIFFERENT AS IT RELATES TO DORITOS AND BUD LIGHT. EXPLAIN THE CONTROVERSY HERE >>. THERE IS A LOT OF OVERLAP. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO BREAK DOWN THE BACKGROUNDS OF IT ALL. HUDSON IS A 24-YEAR-OLD ARTIST AND SINGER IN SPAIN. THE POSING QUESTION APPEARED ABOUT A DECADE AGO WANT TO PULL UP SOME OF THE REPORTING THAT WE HAVE. HUDSON WAS REPORTED TO HAVE TWEETED BACK IN 2015 ABOUT WANTING TO DO QUOTE DEPRAVED THINGS WITH A 12-YEAR-OLD GIRL. THAT'S ACCORDING -- ACCORDING TO ROLLING STONE. NBC NEWS HAS NOT SEEN THE ORIGINAL POST. THEY APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN REMOVED. HUDSON EXPRESSED REMORSE FOR THE STREETS BUT THAT POST, MADE IN 2021, IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE. ON HER PAGE THERE ARE MOTHERS -- OTHERS ONLINE. THE SAKE HUDSON HAS BEEN CRITICAL OF THE RIGHT WING IN SPAIN. SHE APPEARS TO SAY SHE ADVOCATES FOR THE ABOLITION TO DESTROY TRADITIONAL MONOGAMOUS NUCLEAR FAMILY. THAT'S ACCORDING TO A TRANSLATION OF THE VIDEO FROM SPANISH TO ENGLISH. A LOT OF CONTROVERSY SWIRLING AROUND THOSE PORTED COMMENTS TO READ A LAYING OUT EXACTLY HOW THEY FOUND OUT AND WHEN THEY FOUND OUT, AND IMMEDIATELY DISTANCING THEMSELVES FROM DISTANCING THEMSELVES FROM HUDSON ALDRICH. WHAT THEY SAY IS THOSE SPECIFIC COMMENTS. THEY ARE NOT EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE BUD LIGHT CONTROVERSY BUT CERTAINLY SOME OVERLAPPING SHADES. >>. LAURA BARRY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT. ONE APPRECIATE IT. >>>. A LOT MORE COMING UP ON THE SHOW, INCLUDING CHAOS IN HAITI, THE PRIME MINISTER OFF THE, THE PRIME MINISTER OFF THE ISLAND ON AMERICAN SOIL, THE NEW PUSH FROM ACROSS THE CARIBBEAN FOR HIM TO STEP. >>. WHAT DID THIS DEBATE CHANGE VIEW? >>. THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE IS ECONOMY. >> 2024, WHO IS YOUR CANDIDATE? >>. THE RACE IS ON. NOW THE COUNTDOWN HAS BEGUN. NEWS FOR THE GENERATION OF NOW IS NBC NEWS. NOW, NBC NEWS COVERS HUNDREDS OF STORIES EVERY DAY, BECAUSE IT CAN BE TOUGH TO READ OR WATCH OR LISTEN TO THE MALL. OUR BUREAU TEAMS HAVE DONE IT FOR YOU. THIS IS WHAT THEY TELL US IS GOING ON IN THEIR REGIONS. IN A STATEMENT WE CALL THE LOCAL, HUNDREDS OF NATIONAL GUARD MEMBERS ARE BEING DEPLOYED TO TRY TO CONTROL THE CRIME SURGE IN NEW YORK CITY'S SUBWAYS. THE MOVE IS PART OF THE GOVERNORS FIVE POINT SAFETY PLAN THAT INCLUDES THINGS LIKE MORE SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS. IT COMES AS THE NYPD IS GIVEN THE GO-AHEAD TOPICK UP BAD CHECKS OF THE WEST OF YOUR. THE FAMOUS SHOW AT THE BELLAGIO IN VEGAS HAS BEEN PAUSED THINGS TO A VERY RARE BIRD. THIS YELLOW BIRD -- BILLED LOON, SPOTTED IN THE WATER OUTSIDE THE HOTEL. EXPERTS CALL IT ONE OF THE 10 RAREST BIRDS THAT BREEZE ON US MAINLAND. LOOK AT THAT. IT'S GIVING DUCK VIBES TO ME, BUT IT'S A LOON, VERY RARE. THERE WERE CONCERNS THE BIRD, WE GET BOTHERED BY ALL OF THE FOUNTAINS GOING OUT THE LONGEST. --. THE LAS VEGAS REVIEW BUREAU SAYS THE LOON HAS BEEN SAFELY RELOCATED AS OF TODAY OF THE WESTMERE -- BUREAU K9 OFFICERS SPOTTING A MISSING TODDLER IN THE WIND STARTS FROM A LAKE. THE THREE-YEAR-OLD WANTED OFF NEAR HIS HOME MONDAY AFTERNOON. AFTER ABOUT AN HOUR OF SEARCHING THE CANINE, LET HIS HANDLER TOWARD THE LAKE. THE TODDLER ONLY HAD SOME SMALL SCRAPES AND THANKFULLY LOOK AT THAT LITTLE BABE. FOR THAT LITTLE THREE-YEAR-OLD IS EXPECTED TO BE JUST FINE THANK GOODNESS>>>. THE US IS URGING THE HAITIAN PRIME MINISTER TO SPEED UP HIS OWN RESIGNATION AND A POLITICAL TRANSITION TO DEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS AS THE COUNTRY GETS CLOSE TO THE BRINK OF A CIVIL WAR. IN THE LAST FEW HOURS, WE HAVE HEARD FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT SAYING: THEY ARE NOT PUSHING LISTEN TRAN05 >>. WE ARE NOT CALLING ON HIM OR PUSHING FOR HIM TO RESIGN, BUT WE ARE URGING HIM TO EXPEDITE THE TRANSITION TO AN EMPOWERED AND INCLUSIVE GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE THAT WILL MOVE WITH URGENCY TO HELP THE COUNTRY PREPARE FOR A MULTINATIONAL SECURITY SUPPORT MISSION TO ADDRESS THE SECURITY SITUATION AND PAVE THE WAY FOR FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS >>. THE ADMINISTRATION IS BEING CAREFUL. THE IMPORTANT INFORMATION WE ARE NOT PUSHING, WE ARE ENCOURAGING, HE SAID, BECAUSE A SECURITY CRISIS IN HAITI IS HITTING A BREAKING POINT. THE PRIMUS ARE NOW IN PUERTO RICO, NOT ABLE TO FLY BACK TO HAITI BECAUSE AIRPORT THERE HAS BEEN TARGETED. AS WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER THIS WEEK ON THIS SHOW. THIS IS GABE GUTIERREZ PICKING UP COVERAGE NOW OUT OF HAITI. THE US IS IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS VERY DELICATE POWER STRUGGLE HERE. I THINK YOU HEARD IT A LITTLE BIT WHEN WE PLAYED. FROM THE STATE DEPAMENT: WORDS MATTER IN DIPLOMACY. IN THIS INSTANCE, WORDS DEFINITELY MATTER >>. YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. WE JUST HEARD FROM WHAT THE STATE DEPARTMENT SAID ESSENTIALLY: THEY'RE NOT PRESSURING THE PRIME MINISTER TO RESIGN. THEY JUST WANT HIM TO LEAVE A LITTLE FASTER. YES, THEY ARE CHOOSING THEIR WORDS VERY, VERY CAREFULLY. HERE HERE IS SOME OF WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY HAD TO SAY: >> WE ARE DEFINITELY NOT PUSHING THE PRIME MINISTER TO RESIGN. THAT IS NOT WHAT WE ARE DOING. THAT IS NOT WHAT WE ARE DOING. WE HAVE UNDERSCORED THAT. NOW IS THE TIME TO FINALIZE A POLITICAL COURT TO HELP SET HAITI ON A PATH TO A BETTER FUTURE. THAT IS SOMETHING WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON FOR SOME TIME>>. YEAH, THE WHITE HOUSE WALKING THAT FINE LINE. AS YOU SAID, THIS ALL COMES AS PRIME MINISTER. THE PRIME MINISTER IS NOW IN PUERTO RICO. THE WHITE HOUSE ALSO SAYING THAT THEY ARE NOT HELPING THE PRIME MINISTER AT THIS POINT UNCLEAR, WHEN HE PLANS TO RETURN TO HAITI. HE CAME TO POWER BACK IN 2021, FOLLOWING THE ASSASSINATION OF THE COUNTRY'S PRESIDENT. THIS IS A DEFINITE ESCALATION. AS YOU YOU HAVE REPORTED OVER THE WEEKEND, THERE WAS A PRISON BREAK IN THAT COUNTRY. HAITI IS SLIDING FURTHER AND FURTHER INTO CHAOS. AT THIS POINT, LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT CHAOS. WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE ISSUES WITH THAT AIRPORT GETTING TARGETED. IT'S AN AIRPORT- I THINK IT'S THE SAME ONE YOU VISITED WHEN YOU WENT TO HAITI NOT LONG AGO. I THINK IT WAS WITHIN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. THE CONCERN IS TIMING. IF THE SECURITY SITUATION KEEPS GETTING WORSE RIGHT, IF THESE ATTACKS KEEP ON HAPPENING, THE SCOPE OF WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE, WHAT THE US CAN DO, GETS MORE AND MORE NARROW >>. YEAH, EXACTLY, THE OPTIONS ARE LIMITED HERE. LOOK, THE US HAS IN SOME WAY, SHAPE OR ANOTHER, BEEN INVOLVED WITH HAITI FOR A LONG TIME, EVEN IN THE 90s, FOLLOWING THE MILITARY COUP, THE US HAVING TO GET INVOLVED THERE WITH MULTINATIONAL FORCE. NOW THE QUESTION BECOMES: WHAT OPTIONS DOES THE US HAVE? THE WHITE HOUSE HAS BEEN VERY INSISTENT THAT THEY WILL NOT SEND AMERICAN BOOTS ON THE GROUND TO HAITI. BUT NOW THIS MULTINATIONAL SECURITY FORCE LED BY KENYA- WHEN WILL THAT TAKE EFFECT? WHAT OPTIONS DOES THE US HAVE IF THE PRIME MINISTER DOES? NOT IF THE PRIME MINISTER DOES NOT WANT TO. YOU KNOW, GET OUT OF POWER. YES, A LOT OF QUESTIONS REMAINING AT THIS POINT. HALLE MAJOR QUESTION: RIGHT NOW FOR THE US: HOW MUCH DOES IT PLAN TO GET INVOLVED? AND WHEN WILL THESE GANGS, THESE ARMED GANGS IN HAITI THAT NOW CONTROL ABOUT 80%, ACTUALLY, OF PORT-au-PRINCE, WILL THEY ACCEPT ANYTHING IN THE FULL RESIGNATION OF THE PRIME MINISTER? >>. GABE GETER IS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BREAKING IT DOWN, FOR US CAN SEE YOU ARE IN FACT, SOAKING. WET I'M DEEPLY SORRY. WET I'M DEEPLY SORRY. I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT. >>>. TODAY, TSA IS ROLLING OUT SOMETHING THAT COULD CHANGE: THE FUTURE OF CHECKPOINTS AT THE AIRPORT, A SIX-MONTH PLAN. THAT IS KIND OF LIKE SELF CHECKOUT AT THE GROCERY STORE. IT'S ONLY VEGAS FOR NOW AND ONLY PEOPLE WITH PRE-CHECK FOR NOW. SINCE YOU KNOW, WE KNOW- THE ROUTINE IN BESTIES. TOM COSTELLO KNOWS THE ROUTINE AND TRIED OUT FOR HIMSELF: TAKE A LOOK>>. Reporter. COME UP TO THE CHECKPOINT, TAKE YOUR CARRY-ON, PUT IT IN THE BEEN. IF YOU'VE GOT ANY QUESTIONS, SIMPLY ASK THE TSA OFFICER ON- DEMAND>>. HI THERE, HOW MAY HELP YOU TODAY. >>. Reporter, SLIDE YOUR BEEN ON THE ROLLERS AND WALK RIGHT INTO THE FULL BODY SCANNER. PUT YOUR ARMS DOWN TO THE SIDE AND IT'S GOING TO LOOK FOR ANYTHING THAT SHOULDN'T BE THERE AND IT'S TELLING ME. I GOT TO COME BACK OUT. I HAVE A MICROPHONE OF COURSE THAT IT HAS DETECTED. I HAVE THE TRANSMITTER ON MY BELT AND SOMETHING. A LOT OF PEOPLE FORGET MY CELL PHONE. >> LOOK AT YOU. WHAT AN ACTIVE STAND UP TIME. WHAT COMES UP FOR ME IS: YOU KNOW YOU ARE AT THE GROCERY STORE DOING SELF CHECKOUT. IT'S A 50-50 SHOT. YOU MAKE IT THROUGH EASILY. SOMETHING GOES WRONG AND YOU HAVE TO HIT THE BUTTON. THIS IS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE HELPFUL. I'M A LITTLE SKEPTICAL. >> YES, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE TSA IS TRYING TOMORROW. FROM YOUR CHECKPOINT. EXPERIENCE, CHECKOUT, EXPERIENCE AT THE LOCAL GROCERY STORE, WHATEVER YOU USE, DO YOUR MEMBER HOW TO SCAN YOUR BANANAS. I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER THE CODE. >> THERE'S THE NUMBER AND THEN IT GETS AN ERROR. >> THERE'S YOUR APPLES, SHAMPOO, CHICKEN, WHATEVER. FOR THOSE PEOPLE THAT HAVE IT DOWN PAT, THE THINKING IS THE SAME THING MIGHT BE TRUE AT IT YET -- AT A TSA CHECKPOINT, IF YOU ARE A PRE-CHECK, YOU HAVE TO BE PRE-CHECK AND YOU FLY ALL THE TIME AND YOU KNOW HOW TO MAKE THIS MOVE. THIS MAY BE SOMETHING FOR YOU. YOU MAY BE ABLE TO MAKE THIS WORK. I ASKED THE TSA CHIEF DAVID KOSKI. ADMIRAL DAVID KOSKI. IS THIS SOMETHING THAT COULD ROLLOUT NATIONWIDE? MAYBE NOT SO FAST? HERE'S WHAT HE SAID: >> DON'T EXPECT THIS TO BE WIDELY ROLLED OUT AT EVERY AIRPORT, EVERY CHECKPOINT. >>. NO, I DON'T THINK SO. WE ARE VERY EARLY IN THE PROCESS. PART OF WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO IS FIGURE OUT WHAT WORKS, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME MAKING SURE WE CAN PROVIDE THE SECURITY WE PROVIDE. >>. 2.5 MILLION PEOPLE OF COURSE GOING THROUGH TSA CHECKPOINTS EVERYDAY. I GOT A LITTLE HEADLINE FOR YOU. IF YOU ARE GOING ON SPRING BREAK, BE WARNED. TSA SAYS IT'S GOING TO BE EVEN BIGGER THAN LASTER, WHICH WAS A RECORD. WE ALREADY SING PASSENGER VOLUMES UP 6% OVER LAST YEAR. >> YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY: TOM PACK, YOUR PATIENCE. HAVE YOU HEARD THAT ONE BEFORE? I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE HEARD THAT. >> I GOT A TRADEMARK ON THAT. >>. HERE'S A QUESTION RIGHT. THE REASON FOR TSA, THE REASON WE GO THROUGH THESE CHECKPOINTS, IS NOT TO ANNOY ALL OF US AND SLOW US DOWN. IT'S FOR SECURITY AND TO KEEP US SAFE ON THE PLANE. HOW THEY NAVIGATE THAT. HOW THEY NAVIGATE THAT. DO THEY THINK THIS CAN ACTUALLY? -- WE SEE THIS EVERY YEAR ALL THE CRAZY THINGS PEOPLE LEAVE AT CHECKPOINTS THAT ARE CONFISCATED SAFETY VERSUS SPEED. HOW TO THEY NAVIGATE THAT? >> IT'S UNDERSTOOD, THAT IT WAS STOOD UP UNDER -- AFTER 9/11 AND THE TRAGEDY OF 9/11.. AND THEY ARE STILL CONFISCATING RECORD NUMBERS OF GUNS EVERY YEAR AT CHECKPOINTS. THAT'S THE BIG QUESTION. RIGHT, CAN THIS STILL ACHIEVE EXPEDITION? CAN THEY MOVE PEOPLE THROUGH BUT AT THE SAME TIME, CAN YOU HAVE A SECURE CHECKPOINT? THERE IS ALSO THIS GOING ON HERE. THAT IS THIS CONCERN ABOUT WHERE WE ARE IN A COMPETITIVENESS IN TERMS OF OTHER COUNTRIES, AND HOW WELL THEY SCREEN PASSENGERS IS THE TRUTH IS THE US TRAVEL ASSOCIATION SAYS WE ARE NUMBER 17.. RANKING NUMBER 17.. IN TERMS OF OUR COMPETITIVENES, WHAT DO THEY BASE THAT ON? OKAY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, HOW GOOD IS THE AIRPORT? ARE THEY CRUMBLING CHECKPOINTS? >> IS THAT AN AVERAGE OF AIRPORTS? >> YA, NATIONWIDE THE COUNTRIES HAVE HIGHER SCORES. >> REAGAN IS PULLING UP THAT AVERAGE, BUT THERE'S ANOTHER AIRPORT PULLING IT DOWN. >> THAT WAS A LITTLE EDITORIAL ON YOUR PART. >> TO TRAVELERS LIKE IT? >> I THINK IT'S A LITTLE GLITCHY, MAYBE TOO MUCH TO ASK OF PASSENGERS. RIGHT NOW. >> ALL RIGHT, WE WILL SEE. >> IF YOU CAN'T REMEMBER YOUR BANANA CODE, BUT IF IT'S TESTED AND VEGAS WILL IT, STAY IN VEGAS, WE WILL SEE. >> LOOK AT YOU, COMPOSTELA, APPRECIATE YOU. SUPER INTERESTING. >>>. A LOT MORE TO COME ON. THE SHOW INCLUDING AS TOM AND I WERE TALKING. IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S A VERDICT IN THE REST TRIAL THAT WE TALKED ABOUT. AT THE TOP OF THE SHOW WE ARE GETTING DANA GRIFFITH BACK AND WE WILL TELL YOU IN IS CUT OFF>>. NEWS FOR THE GENERATION OF NOW IS NBC NEWS NOW, NOW >>> IN-DEPTH REPORTING. TONIGHT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NUCLEAR POWER AND AI. THOSE TWO WORDS TOGETHER. FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE MAY BE FEELING A LITTLE BIT SCARY, RIGHT NUKES AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. FOR OTHERS IT MAY BRING BACK FRIGHTENING MEMORIES OF DISASTERS LIKE CHERNOBYL OR THREE MILE ISLAND. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT NUCLEAR PLANS, A NEW GENERATION OF ENTREPRENEURS WANTS TO BUILD NEWER, SAFER PLAN, SECOND PART OF THE FUTURE OF AI. HERE IS TIM GORDON >> Reporter. THIS FROM OUTSIDE AND EASTERN IDAHO COULD SOON BE THE BIRTHPLACE OF A NEW NUCLEAR AGE. >> REPROCESSING AND RE FABRICATION OF TRAN05. >> A RESEARCH THE CITY WHERE THE US EXPERIENCING WITH A SAVER KIND OF NUCLEAR REACTOR. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PUT THEIR EARLY RESEARCH REACTORS OUT HERE BECAUSE IT'S FULL OF UNDERGROUND WATER. FRANKLY, THERE'S NO ONE OUT HERE. DECADES AFTER, THE PLANTS STOPPED RUNNING. A SILICON VALLEY COMPANY WANTS TO BUILD A NEW VERSION, A 15 MEGAWATT REACTOR: >> MAKING FUEL FOR OUR FRONTLINE. >>. Reporter. THE REACTOR WILL USE LIQUID METAL AS A COOLANT AND LEFT OVER NUCLEAR WASTE FROM THE GOVERNMENT AS FUEL. >>. THIS WILL COVER THE FUEL. >> YEAH, AND THEN WILL FABRICATED. >>. Reporter. THE COMPANY'S CEO HAS BEEN WORKING IN NUCLEAR SINCE HE WAS 16 AND ENVISIONS HIS REACTOR POWERING A TOWN OR A FACTORY. >>. FOR MOST OF MY LIFE, THERE HAS NOT BEEN A QUESTION ABOUT THE DEMAND FOR WHAT NUCLEAR ENERGY IS, WHICH IS RELIABLE, CLEAN AND AFFORDABLE- ALL WHAT PEOPLE APPEARED. >>. Reporter. JEFF BEZOS, BILL GATES AND A HOST OF FIRMS INVESTED IN SEVERAL NUCLEAR COMPANIES. >>. THERE'S A LONG HISTORY OF HUMANS AND MACHINES WORKING TOGETHER. >>. Reporter. THE OPEN AI. >>. Reporter. THE OPEN AI CEO IS SPEAKING OPENLY ABOUT REQUIRING HUGE AMOUNTS OF POWER FOR THE DATA CENTERS THAT MAKE AI POSSIBLE. >>. THIS IS LIKE A DESPERATE NEED FOR AS MUCH ENERGY AS WE CAN MANUFACTURE. >>. Reporter. THIS IS NOT AN UNREGULATED TECHNOLOGY LIKE AI. THIS IS NUCLEAR, WHERE THE WASTE FROM EVEN NEW REACTOR DESIGNS WILL REMAIN DANGEROUSLY RADIOACTIVE FOR CENTURIES. IN 2022, THE NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION SAID THEY HAD NOT PROVIDED ENOUGH SAFETY INFORMATION. THE COMPANY IS WORKING TO SATISFIED REGULATIONS. >>. YOU GOT NEW PHYSICS, YOU'VE GOT TO USE NEW MODELS AND DO ALL SORTS OF THINGS THAT ARE DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THEY USED TO. A LOT OF THINGS HE USED TO DO DON'T APPLY. INSURING THIS MEETS ADEQUATE SAFETY REQUIREMENTS >>. Reporter FOLKS SEEM PRETTY COMFORTABLE WITH THE IDEA. >> I THINK IT'S GREAT WE'VE HAD BEFORE. >>. AT THIS POINT YOU WOULD SAY YOU ARE PRETTY COMFORTABLE WITH THE NEW DEPARTMENT >> YEAH >>. Reporter ARGUE THAT NUCLEAR SOLVES THE PROBLEM FOR TECH CEOS, NOT FOR HUMANITY. >>. IF YOU WERE TO INTEGRATE LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS, GPT STYLE MODELS, INTO SEARCH ENGINES, IT'S GOING TO COST YOU KNOW FIVE TIMES AS MUCH ENVIRONMENTALLY AS STANDARD SOURCES. I WANT TO SEE INNOVATION IN THIS COUNTRY. I JUST WANT THE SCOPE OF INNOVATION TO BE DETERMINED BEYOND. YOU KNOW THE INCENTIVE STRUCTURES OF THESE GIANT COMPANIES. >>. WHAT WE DID IS JUST CUT BACK ON OUR ENERGY CONSUMPTION. I WE NEED MORE TO FEED OUR SOCIETY, MORE AND MORE AND MORE POWER >>. YEAH, I WILL INTO THAT TWO WAYS. WE HAVE ALMOST ALWAYS SEEN A DIRECT -- HIGH ENERGY IMPOTENCE. AND WE ARE STILL SO FAR AWAY FROM ELECTRIFYING VEHICLES AND THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY NEEDED AND THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY NEEDED TO DO THAT IS HUGE>>. Reporter. ON THE ONE HAND QUESTION HERE IS JUST LOGISTICAL RIGHT. IF WE ARE GOING TO ELECTRIFY EVERYTHING, FROM CARS TO KITCHEN RANGES, WE ARE GOING TO NEED VASTLY MORE POWER THAN WE CAN CURRENTLY PRODUCE. THIS ALSO RAISES A PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTION: RIGHT, WHOSE INTERESTS ARE WE SERVING BY GOING TO NUCLEAR? SERVING THE INTEREST OF COMPANIES THAT WANT TO BUILD AI PRODUCTS AND EV AND FIGURE OUT WAYS TO POWER THEM? OR ARE WE ACTUALLY SERVING HUMANITY'S INTEREST'S? ARE WE TRYING TO LIVE WITH MORE POWER, OR SHOULD WE BE TRYING TO LIVE WITH LESS HALLE? >>. IT SEES DIFFICULT AND REALLY INTENSE QUESTIONS. THANKS TO OUR GOOD FRIEND FOR ALL OF THAT AMAZING REPORTED. THAT DOES IT FOR THIS HOUR. WE WILL HAVE SPECIAL COVERAGE OF THE STATE OF THE UNION TOMORROW NIGHT, RIGHT HERE ON ABC NEWS. NOW, FIND IT. HOWEVER YOU ARE WATCHING >>>. PLUS, WHY? FAR RIGHT FIGURES, I MIGHT'VE TAKEN ON DORITOS WITH A PARTNERSHIP WITH A WITH A PARTNERSHIP WITH A TRANSGENDER INFLUENCER>>>. TONIGHT, THE LONGEST GENERAL ELECTION IN A GENERATION BEGINS WITH DONALD TRUMP, NOW THE PRESUMPTIVE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE SETTING UP A REMATCH WITH PRESIDENT BIDEN. WE HAVE NOT HAD THE MAJOR CANDIDATES LOCKED DOWN THIS EARLY SINCE MY SPACE HIT 1 MILLION USERS BACK IN 2004.. 244 DAYS UNTIL THE GENERAL ELECTION. AFTER 243 OF THEM, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO AVOID THE MOMENT- THE POLLS SHOW. MOST AMERICANS HAVE BEEN DREADING ELECTION DAY FEATURING FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP AND PRESIDENT BIDEN. MORE THAN HALF OF THE VOTERS SAY THEY DON'T WANT EITHER AS THEIR NOMINEE. TWO THIRDS SAY THEY WANT SOMEBODY. NEW 67%- THEY ARE NOT GETTING THAT. NIKKI HALEY TODAY DECIDED HER TIME IS UP. AFTER. SHE WON JUST ONE STATEMENT TO -- SUPER TUESDAY >>. IT IS NOW UP TO DONALD TRUMP TO EARN THE VOTES OF THOSE IN OUR PARTY AND BEYOND DID, NOT SUPPORT HIM. SUPPORT HIM. I HOPE HE DOES THAT. AT ITS BEST, POLITICS IS ABOUT BRINGING PEOPLE INTO YOUR CAUSE, NOT TURNING THEM AWAY. >>. THE FORMER PRESIDENT MOCKING HALEY AVON AS HE TRIES TO GET HIS SUPPORTERS BEHIND HIS TEAM. A DIRECTIVE TO FALL IN LINE IS THE LAST HOLDOUT. THAT IS, PARTIES ARE DOING JUST THAT, INCLUDING MITCH McCONNELL. HE SUMMED UP HIS ENDORSEMENT BY GUSHING EXUBERANTLY THAT MR TRUMP HAS THE ""REQUISITE SUPPORT OF REPUBLICAN VOTERS"". RESIGNATION TO THE REALITY PERHAPS THAT THIS IS DONALD TRUMP'S PARTY. PRESIDENT BIDEN HOPING TO PEEL. PRESIDENT BIDEN HOPING TO PEEL AWAY HALEY SUPPORTERS WHO FEEL. THERE IS NOT A PLACE FOR THEM IN THE MAGA MOVEMENT. EXIT POLLS OUT OF A FEW KEY STATES SHOW. THERE ARE HALEY VOTERS ARE NOT PROMISING TO BACK. DONALD TRUMP DOES THAT, MEAN THEY WILL GO FOR JOE BIDEN OR STAY HOME. I WANT TO START WITH VAUGHN HILLYARD, STEPS AWAY FROM MAR-A LAGO IN WEST PALM BEACH, FLORIDA. WE SHOWED THE POST. THE FORMER PRESIDENT PUT UP TAKING JABS AT NIKKI HALEY, SAYING SHE WAS TROUNCE EVENING, AS HE SAID. HEY SUPPORTERS, COME MY WAY. WILL THERE BE A SERIOUS ATTEMPT TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN, OR WILL THIS BE DONALD TRUMP SAYING: LET'S DO IT RATHER THAN AN OLIVE BRANCH >>. Reporter. WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH THIS HERE BEFORE. USUALLY IT IS THE POWER DYNAMICS AT PLAY, THAT OF LED PROMINENT REPUBLICANS TO COME BACK TO DONALD TRUMP. BACK TO DONALD TRUMP IF YOU -- HE WERE TO WIN THE PRESIDENCY, HE WOULD ALL BUT RUN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. NIKKI HALEY WAS CRITICAL EIGHT YEARS AGO OF DONALD TRUMP, WHEN HE WAS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT THE FIRST GO ROUND AND A COUPLE MONTHS LATER SHE BACKED HIS CAMPAIGN AND THEN BECAME THE UN AMBASSADOR UNDER HIS ADMINISTRATION. THE QUESTION HERE IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT. SHE WAS ACTUALLY RUNNING HER OWN CAMPAIGN AGAINST HIM. HERE THE QUESTION IS TO WHAT EXTENT DONALD TRUMP EVEN FEELS LIKE HE NEEDS TO APPEAL TO NIKKI HALEY DIRECTLY BECAUSE THE CAMPAIGN- THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN- FEELS THAT IN A BIDEN-TRUMP MATCHUP, MOST INDEPENDENT VOTERS WILL FALL TO TRUMP, REGARDLESS OF WHAT NIKKI HALEY DIRECTLY HAS TO SAY, WAS INTO A PART OF THE CONVERSATION WITH THE CO CAMPAIGN MANAGER FOR TRUMP. >> PEOPLE SHOULD NOT EXPECT A. >> PEOPLE SHOULD NOT EXPECT A BIG CHANGE IN TONE. BIG CHANGE IN TONE. >>. Reporter. IT'S WORKING FOR THIS CAMPAIGN. IT HAS BEEN ON THE GROUND FOR 17 MONTHS. SOME FOLKS OF SAID HE HAS TO APPEAL TO A GREATER SWATH OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND YOU CAN SAY TONE IT DOWN AND CHANGE HIS APPEAL DONALD TRUMP TO THE EXACT OPPOSITE. HE WAS INDICTED FOUR TIMES AND FOUND TO ENGAGE REPEATEDLY IN FINANCIAL FRAUD AND TO ARE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED. E JEAN CARROLL AND YET HE STILL. HANDILY WON THE REPUBLICAN. HANDILY WON THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION. >>. YOU TALK ABOUT THE LEGAL ISSUES THE FORMER PRESIDENT IS FACING. WE NOW HAVE LEARNED OF THE DATE. THE SUPREME COURT WILL HEAR ARGUMENT AND THAT REALLY IMPORTANT PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY CASE IS APRIL 25.. THE LEGAL AND POLITICAL CALENDARS MERGING, ESPECIALLY AFTER THE CITY MARCH, ESPECIALLY AFTER THE CITY MARCH 25 BEING THE START OF THE HUSH MONEY TRIAL >>. Reporter. THIS IS WHERE THE STAKES ARE DIFFERENT. THIS IS MORE THAN AN INDICTMENT. THIS IS A MATTER-OF- FACTLY GOING TO TRIAL. LET'S START WITH MARCH 25.. 19 DAYS AWAY, THIS LITTLE GRACE PERIOD BETWEEN WINNING THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION, THE PRESUMPTIVE NOMINEE, AND THEN HAVING TO SHOW UP IN A COURTROOM ANYWHERE FROM 3 TO 6 WEEKS IN NEW YORK CITY ON WEEKS IN NEW YORK CITY ON FELONY COUNTS, IS RAPIDLY APPROACHING FAST-FORWARD EMMA SLATER, APRIL 25,, THE HIGH-STAKES ORAL ARGUMENT. THE FRONT OF THE US SUPREME COURT ON WHETHER HE, WHEN IT COMES TO THE FEDERAL ELECTION INTERFERENCE CHARGES, HE FACES STEMMING FROM THE WASHINGTON DC INDICTMENT WHETHER HE WAS GRANTED PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY AND PROTECTED FROM HIS OFFICIAL CAPACITY WITHIN THE WHITE HOUSE DURING THAT TIME PERIOD. THE SUPREME COURT DECISION THAT WOULD COME SEVERAL WEEKS LATER WOULD HAVE HIGH-STAKES AND WHETHER THAT CRIMINAL TRIAL ACTUALLY EVER TAKES PLACE LET ALONE BEFORE THE NOVEMBER GENERAL ELECTION. >>. VAUGHN HILLYARD, THANK YOU. >>>. BREAKING NEWS AND ALIVE LOOK INSIDE THE COURTROOM FOR THE RUST TRIAL, THE ARMOR FOR THE MOVIE WE KNOW THAT JURORS HAVE REVERTED. I'M GOING TO ASK IF THIS IS ALIVE LOOK. I BELIEVE IT IS. THIS IS LIVE. YOU WERE LOOKING AT HANNAH GUTIERREZ-REED, AGAIN ALIVE LOOK IN COURT, AS SHE IS PREPARING TO HEAR THE. SHE IS PREPARING TO HEAR THE VERDICT IN THE CASE AGAINST HER PROSECUTORS IN CLOSING ARGUMENTS HAVE TOLD THE JURY THAT WHEN GUTIERREZ-REED WASN'T DOING HER JOB, FILMING WAS LIKE A GAME OF RUSSIAN ROULETTE. EVERY TIME AN ACTOR HAD A GUN WANT TO SEE IF WE HAVE AUDIO TO LISTEN INTO THE VERDICT. WE DO NOT HAVE AUDIO. WE DO NOT HAVE AUDIO. WE DO HAVE A PRODUCER IN COURT, I BELIEVE DANA GRIFFIN IS INCORPORATE. I HEAR SOME OF THE BACKGROUND NOISE. THEY MAY HAVE TURNED ON THE MICROPHONES. WE ARE GOING TO LISTEN IN REMEMBER WHAT SHE FACES. THIS IS AN ISSUE WHERE SHE IS ACCUSED. SHE LOADED THE GUN THAT WENT OFF IN THE HAND OF ALEC BALDWIN BACK IN OCTOBER 2021.. THAT LED TO THE DEATH OF THE CINEMATOGRAPHER FOR THE MOVIE, HALYNA HUTCHINS. IT IS NOW UP TO THE JURY TO DECIDE IF SHE IS GUILTY OR NOT, WITH INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER AND TAMPERING OF EVIDENCE. WE HAVE AUDIO NOW: >>. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY, HAVE YOU REACHED A VERDICT? >> YES. >>. LET ME SEE THE VERDICT. >> MOMENTS AWAY FROM THE. >> MOMENTS AWAY FROM THE VERDICT BEING READ. REMEMBER, THIS ONLY WENT TO THE JURY THIS AFTERNOON. THEY HAVE NOT HAVE A CASE FOR THAT LONG. WE JUST SAW CLOSING ARGUMENTS PRESENTED TODAY FROM BOTH THE PROSECUTION AND THE DEFENSE. THE DEFENSE HAS TRIED TO MAKE THE CASE ESSENTIALLY THAT HANNAH GUTIERREZ-REED WAS NOT THE ONE WHO WAS ULTIMATELY TO BLAME. LET'S LISTEN: >> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY, THROUGH THE FOUR PERSON. HAVE YOU REACHED A VERDICT? >> YES. >>. DO YOU WISH TO READ THE VERDICTS? >> SURE. >> OKAY, START WITH COUNT ONE. >>. -- WILL THE DEFENDANT PLEASE STAND? >>. WE FIND THE DEFENDANT HANNAH. WE FIND THE DEFENDANT HANNAH GUTIERREZ-REED GUILTY OF INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER, AS CHARGED IN COUNT ONE. WE FIND THE DEFENDANT HANNAH GUTIERREZ-REED NOT GUILTY OF GUTIERREZ-REED, NOT GUILTY OF TAMPERING WITH EVIDENCE, AS CHARGED IN COUNT TWO. >>. LET ME GET THOSE FORMS FROM YOU. I WILL DO WHAT'S CALLED: POLLING THE JURY. WHAT I NEED TO PUT ON THE RECORD IS THAT THIS IS YOUR INDIVIDUAL VERDICT. OKAY, OKAY, I WILL START WITH THE GENTLE MAN IN THE BACK. IS THIS YOUR VERDICT? >> YES >>. IS INTROVERTED >> YES >>. HANNAH GUTIERREZ-REED. THE ARMOR ON THE SET OF THE MOVIE RUST THE DAY THAT HALYNA HUTCHINS WAS KILLED BY A GUN GOING OFF ONSET, FOUND GUILTY OF INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER, NOT GUILTY OF TAMPERING WITH EVIDENCE. YOU SAW HER. WITH NO REACTION, VERY LITTLE REACTION AS THE COUNTS WERE READ. WANT TO BRING IN OUR NBC NEWS. WANT TO BRING IN OUR NBC NEWS. LEGAL ANALYST: HE, WE HAVE HANNAH GUTIERREZ-REED IN HER LATE 20s, AFTER TWO WEEKS NOW OF THIS TRIAL. ALEC BALDWIN GOES TO TRIAL LATER ON THIS YEAR. REMEMBER, THIS IS NOW SEPARATE. REMEMBER, THIS IS NOW SEPARATE WITH THE CASE ON BALDWIN. CAN YOU FIRST EXPLAINED THE DIFFERENCE IN THE CHARGES? WHY WOULD A JURY FIND HER GUILTY OF ONE CHARGE AND NOT THE OTHER. HELP US UNDERSTAND THAT >>. THAT IS THE ONE THAT MYSTIFIES ME THE MOST AND APPROVES THE ADAGE THAT YOU CAN NEVER GUESS WHAT A JURY WOULD DO IF ANYTHING I WOULD HAVE SAID TAMPERING WITH EVIDENCE WOULD HAVE BEEN THE SLAMDUNK AND INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER WHAT MIGHT'VE BEEN AN ACQUITTAL ALTHOUGH. THIS WAS THE STRONGER OF THE TWO CASES THE STATE HAD. AFTER, ALL THE CASE THEY HAD WAS THAT HANNAH GUTIERREZ-REED WAS SOMEBODY WITH RESPONSIBILITY FOR FIREARM SAFETY ONSET. NOW SHE SHARED THAT WITH OTHER PEOPLE. THE DEFENSE MEDICATION WAS OVERWORKED AND MADE TO DO TWO. OVERWORKED AND MADE TO DO TWO JOBS. I THINK THE STATE, WHEN THEY MADE THE INITIAL PROMISE THEY WOULD PROVE WHERE THE LIVE ROUNDS CAME FROM. IT SEEMS TO ME MOST OF THE PROOF WAS WELL WHERE ELSE COULD THEY HAVE COME FROM BUT HANNAH GUTIERREZ-REED BUT IT APPEARS THE JURY BELIEVED THE EVIDENCE BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT. THE WAY I SAW THIS CASE IS THAT EITHER AN ACQUITTAL OR CONVICTION IS GOOD NEWS FOR ALEC BALDWIN, FOR SEVERAL REASONS TO EXPLAIN THAT. >>. TO MATTER WHAT, ALEC BALDWIN GETS A FIRST LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE. THIS IS ONE OF PHEASANT THAT SEVERAL MISSTEPS BY THE STATE TRYING THESE DEFENDANT SEPARATELY, SEPARATELY. NOW, ALEC BALDWIN HAS PRETTY MUCH SEEN WITH THE STATE CASE IS FRANKLY. IF YOU'RE ALEC BALDWIN, YOU TAKE THIS CASE AGAINST HANNAH GUTIERREZ-REED AND THAT IS YOUR DEFENSE. HE IS POINTING THE FINGER AT SOMEBODY ELSE WHO IS RESPONSIBLE. THEY WILL PUT HANNAH GUTIERREZ REED ON TRIAL. THE DEFENSE FOR ALEC BALDWIN. NOW THEY HAVE THE BENEFIT OF DOING THAT FOR THEM, JUST BEFORE ALEX BALDWIN'AS TRIAL. ALEX BALDWIN'AS TRIAL- HE CAN VOICE THE BLAME ON HER. AN ACQUITTAL WOULD ALSO BE GOOD, BECAUSE IT SHOWS THE STATE CASE IS NOT STRONG AND IT IS THEIR STRONGEST CASE AGAINST THE ARMOR >>. I BELIEVE SHE WOULD FACE UP TO 18 MONTHS BEHIND BARS IF, IN FACT, THE JUDGE FOLLOWS THE SENTENCING GUIDELINES WHICH HAPPENS DOWN THE ROAD. IS THIS APPEALABLE? IS HER TEAM EXPECTED TO POTENTIALLY APPEAL? >>. YES, EVERY CONVICTION IS APPEALED. THE RULES ARE SLIGHTLY. THE RULES ARE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FROM STATE TO STATE AND THE FEDERAL SYSTEM, BUT IN TERMS OF THE TIME TO DO IT. BUT THAT IS THE RULE. YOU GET AN AUTOMATIC APPEAL TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS. APPEALS BEYOND THAT ARE DISCRETIONARY. THERE WILL BE AN APPEAL. THIS CASE WILL BE APPEALED. THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT. THEY MAY HAVE SOME LEGAL ISSUES ON APPEAL, BUT IT IS ALWAYS A HOLLOW PROMISE THAT THE APPEAL WILL COME STATISTICALLY. THE ODDS ARE SO SLIM ON APPEAL. ODDS ARE SO SLIM ON APPEAL IN ANY CASE, WHETHER IT IS A HIGH RISK CASE, LIKE I THINK THIS IS, OR JUST YOUR RUN-OF-THE- MILL CASE. WE HAVE NEVER HEARD OF AN APPEAL AFTER COMMISSION. REALLY ISN'T MUCH OF AN REALLY ISN'T MUCH OF AN ASSURANCE >>. WHAT HAPPENS NOW? WE JUST SAW THE SHOT. THERE IS A MOTION IN COURT IS NOT CLEAR WHO THE FOLKS ARE IN THE BACK RIGHT. NOW WE WILL GET TO OUR PRODUCER WHO IS IN COURT ONCE THEY LEAVE THE ROOM, THIS SHE IMMEDIATELY GET REMANDED TO CUSTODY. HERE. IS THAT WHAT IS HAPPENING? >>. TYPICALLY, WHETHER OR NOT, A DEFENDANT GETS REMANDED IMMEDIATELY AFTER HE CONVICTION IS REALLY NOT RELATED TO WHAT THE SENTENCE WILL BE. IF YOU LOOK AT THE GRAVITY OF THE CRIME, USUALLY, THAT IS A FUNCTION OF: HAS SHE BEEN OUT PRIOR TO THE VERDICT AND HAS SHE DONE WELL ON PRETRIAL RELEASE OFTEN, YOU CAN REMAIN OUT HOWEVER. SOMETIMES THE DA WILL ASK FOR REMAND AFTER A CONVICTION IN A CASE WHERE, FOR EXAMPLE, YOU HAVE AN INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER. THE INTERESTING THING HERE IS THAT THE REMAND ITSELF IS NOT NECESSARILY RELATED TO HER SENTENCING BUT THE SENTENCE HE -- SENTENCING WILL NOT LIKELY HAPPEN FOR SOME TIME. THEY HAVE TO PUT TOGETHER A. THEY HAVE TO PUT TOGETHER A PRESENTENCE REPORT >>. IT LOOKS LIKE. SHE WAS COMFORTED BRIEFLY, SHE IS NOW EXITING THE COURTROOM. WE ARE NOW LOOKING AHEAD TO THE TRIAL OF ALEC BALDWIN, WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO START IN JULY. LOTS OF DEVELOPMENTS IN BREAKING NEWS ON THAT FRONT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR WALKING US THROUGH IT RIGHT HERE ON NBC NEWS NOW >>>. LET'S GO BACK TO WASHINGTON. WE'RE LOOKING AHEAD TO ANOTHER BIG MOMENT IN POLITICS, NOT JUST THE START OF THE GENERAL ELECTION BUT PRESIDENT BIDEN GETTING READY TO MAKE WHAT IS BASICALLY A RESPONSE, A REBUTTAL TO DONALD TRUMP'S SWEEP ON SUPER TUESDAY. LOOK AT THIS GRAPHIC: THESE ARE THE TOP 100 MOST VIEWED BROADCASTS OF LAST YEAR. LOOK AT ALL THOSE: FOOTBALLS, SPORTS, PRO SPORTS, COLLEGE SPORTS- THERE ARE A COUPLE OF EXCEPTIONS, LIKE THE OSCARS, THE THANKSGIVING DAY PARADE AND THE AMERICAN FLAG. IS THE STATE OF THE UNION. A LOT OF PEOPLE WATCH. IT IS STILL A BIG MOMENT FOR PRESIDENT BY THE. THE REPORT IS THAT THE PRESIDENT KNOWS THAT. THE QUESTION IS: WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON? EXPECT TO HEAR ABOUT THE COST OF DRUGS, IMMIGRATION AND THE BORDER AND THE ISRAEL-HAMAS MORE? ALL OF IT IS WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE SEES AS A LEAD UP TO A FULL ON FLOOD, THE ZONE MOMENT FOR HIS MESSAGE. LET'S PICK UP ON ONE OF THOSE- LET'S PICK UP ON ONE OF THOSE TOPICS: THE ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR. THE PRESIDENT HAS HIS OPPOSITION TO HIS HANDLING OF THAT WAR, EVEN INSIDE HIS OWN PARTY. WE SAW THAT WITH THAT UNCOMMITTED PROTEST PUSH IN MICHIGAN TO A LESSER DEGREE IN MINNESOTA. IT IS ENTIRELY POSSIBLE, IF THERE IS ANY REACTION FROM THE CHAMBER TOMORROW NIGHT, IT MAY NOT JUST COME FROM THE RIGHT BUT POSSIBLY EVEN HIS LEFT >>. Reporter. IT IS POSSIBLE. CERTAINLY. THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE PRESIDENT'AS TEAM ARE PREPARING FOR THAT. LAWMAKERS CAN INVITE GUESTS TO SIT IN THE GALLERY. THE ARE TYPICALLY NOT SEEN ON CAMERA BUT THEY ARE THERE. EACH LAWMAKER GETS TO INVITE ONE PERSON. ONE PERSON WE CERTAINLY SEEM WHEN THE FIRST LADY HAS GUESTS AND SO FORTH. YOU GET A SENSE OF THAT. THE IT IS POSSIBLE. THERE WILL BE THOSE WHO VOICE THEIR CONCERNS ON THE LEFT, ON THE RIGHT, FOR DIFFERENT REASONS, AND SO PART OF WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE IS DONE IS: TRY TO THINK THROUGH WAYS. HE CAN RESPOND TO THAT IN REAL TIME. THEY BELIEVE LAST YEAR, WHEN THERE WAS CALLING OUT FROM LAWMAKERS ABOUT ISSUES, THAT HE LAWMAKERS ABOUT ISSUES THAT HE WAS ABLE TO REACT. SHOW, AGILITY SHOW- HE WAS IN COMMAND OF THE ROOM. THAT WORKED WELL FOR THE PRESIDENT IN THE EYES OF HIS ADVISORS AND TEAM. THEY ARE PREPARING FOR THAT POTENTIAL, KNOWING THAT IN JUST ONE YEAR THE WORLD HAS CHANGED SO DRAMATICALLY WITH GOD, THE ONGOING CONCERNS ABOUT UKRAINE AND ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT MAKE ESTATE OF YOU, THE UNION, SUCH A BIG OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PRESIDENT >>. THERE'S ALSO. THIS PIECE, MR TRUMP HAS A CLEAR PATH WITH NIKKI HALEY OUT. THERE IS ALSO, AND HE WAS NOT A MAJOR FORCE IN THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY BUT HE EXISTED. CONGRESSMAN DEAN PHILLIPS DROPPING OUT OF THE RACE AGAINST PRESIDENT BIDEN. WE'RE JUST LEARNING THE PHONE CALL BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND THE CONGRESSMAN. THE CONGRESSMAN TRUCK. HE CALLED HIM. THIS IS A KIND OF THING YOU WOULD TYPICALLY SEE. IT IS A DIFFERENT APPROACH THAN FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP IS TAKING, WITH NIKKI HALEY DROPPING OUT OF THE RACE. ALTHOUGH, DEAN PHILLIPS IS NOT A BIG PRESENCE, HE WAS PART OF THAT VOICE OF CRITICISM WITHIN THE PARTY. THAT IS A CONCERN FOR THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN, THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN. THEY WANT ALL THE DISPARATE PARTS OF THE TEAM TO BE ROWING IN THE SAME DIRECTION. THERE WAS A PHONE CALL, AN OUTREACH TO SAY: JOIN US, WORK WITH US, WITH US. THAT IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING IN HIS HOME STATE OF MINNESOTA. IT IS A BIG MIDWEST BATTLEGROUND. THAT WILL BE IMPORTANT. AND SO, PRESIDENT BIDEN WHETHER. IT IS NIKKI HALEY TODAY, WERE HE PRAISED HER BRAVERY AND COURAGE RUNNING IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY AND ALSO SPOKE TO HER SUPPORTERS SAYING TO BE OPEN TO POTENTIALLY VOTING FOR HIM EVEN, THOUGH HE IS A DEMOCRAT AND NOT THE BASE FOR NIKKI HALEY. VOTERS DOING THAT AND OUTREACHING TO DEAN PHILLIPS SAYING HE IS DEAN PHILLIPS SAYING HE IS TRYING TO BUILD A COALITION TO WIN FOR A SECOND TIME. >>. KELLY O'DONNELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT. WILL SEE YOU AND THE REST OF THE TEAM TOMORROW NIGHT WITH SPECIAL COVERAGE OF THE STATE OF THE UNION, RIGHT HERE ON NBC NEWS NOW. >>>. IN JUST THE LAST HOUR, ACTUALLY THE LAST COUPLE OF MINUTES, YOU'VE SEEN ACTION OUT OF ALABAMA WHERE THE STATEHOUSE VOTED TO APPROVE A BILL TO PROTECT IVF CLINICS FROM LAWSUITS AND BUILT LIKELY TO GET TO THE GOVERNOR 'S DESK. YOU'RE NOW LOOKING AT LIGHT- YOU'RE NOW LOOKING AT LIGHT- PICTURES OF THE STATE SENATE WHERE THE GOVERNOR HAS SAID SHE WILL SIGN AS IF IT GETS TO HER. LAWMAKERS HAVE BEEN DEBATING THIS AFTER THAT CONTROVERSIAL RULING THAT SAID FROZEN EMBRYOS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED CHILDREN, WITH THE SAME RIGHTS AS CHILDREN. SOME LAWYERS HAVE SAID THE WAY THIS BILL IS CRAFTED DOESN'T DO ENOUGH. DR BIRX IS LIVE FROM MONTGOMERY, ALABAMA. THIS IS A PROCESS WE HAVE BEEN ANTICIPATING. THIS IS MOVING QUICKLY. NOW WE ARE BASICALLY IN THE FINAL PRO FORMA FINISH, PRO FORMA, FINISH. IT IS EXPECTED TO GET THROUGH THE HOUSE, THE SENATE, AND GET TO THE GOVERNOR. AND THEN WHAT? DO IVF CLINICS THEN RESTART PROCEDURES RIGHT AWAY? DO THE FAMILIES OF THE BEEN IN LIMBO GET SOME CLARITY? >>. Reporter. WE WERE JUST IN THE HOUSE CHAMBER SOME OF THE QUESTIONS BEING ASKED AS THIS WAS DEBATED ON THE FLOOR WERE FOCUSED ON: DOES THIS GIVE CONFIDENCE TO CLINICS PROVIDING IVF TREATMENT TO REOPEN AND RESTART THOSE PROCEDURES? THE ANSWER FROM THE FOLKS WHO HAVE BEEN CRAFTING THIS WAS YES, THEY SAY THEY HAVE TALKED TO DOCTORS AND THESE FACILITIES. THEY ALSO TALKED TO THE. THEY ALSO TALKED TO THE NUMEROUS ENTITIES THAT PROVIDE THE TOOLS AND RESOURCES IN ORDER TO TRANSPORT EMBRYOS, FOR EXAMPLE, AND ALL PARTS OF THE PROCESS. THEY FEEL CONFIDENT. THEY CAN NOW CONTINUE. THIS IS A BILL THAT WILL SOON BECOME LAW, POTENTIALLY AS BECOME LAW POTENTIALLY, AS SOON AS TONIGHT. THAT WILL GRANT BLANKET IMMUNITY TO ALL OF THOSE INVOLVED IN THE IVF PROCESS. HERE IS WHAT ONE OF THE FERTILITY DOCTORS I TALKED TO TOLD ME ABOUT WHAT THIS MEANS >>. WE HAVE WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS BILL TO PASS IN FACT, ANTICIPATING EMBRYO TRANSFERS AS SOON AS TOMORROW OR FRIDAY. WE KNOW THERE ARE LARGER QUESTIONS SURROUNDING THE SUPREME COURT RULING AND SOME UNCERTAINTIES ABOUT WHETHER THE SUPREME COURT WILL ACCEPT THIS BILL AS PART OF OUR LAW. >>. Reporter. THERE IS A BUT HERE. HERE, ONE OF THE LAWMAKERS I TALKED TO ESSENTIALLY CALL THIS A BAND AID ON A HEMORRHAGING WOUND. THIS IS A STOPGAP MEASURE THAT WILL ENSURE FAMILIES CAN RESTART THE PROCESS, BUT IT DOES NOT TOUCH THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE THAT CAME OUT OF THIS RULING, WHICH IS THAT EMBRYOS SHOULD BE TREATED AS CHILDREN. IT WAS EQUITY BASED ON A 2018 AMENDMENT TO THE ALABAMA STATE CONSTITUTION THAT SAYS EMBRYOS ARE PEOPLE. THAT IS AT THE HEART OF THE ISSUE. THAT HAS NOT BEEN TOUCHED HERE. THAT HAS NOT BEEN TOUCHED HERE. THERE ARE LAWMAKERS AND LAWYERS- A LOT OF FOLKS QUESTIONING WHETHER THIS STILL LEAVES THE DOOR OPEN TO LIABILITY AND A WHOLE OTHER CAN OF WORMS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY HARM FAMILIES AND MAKE THIS PROCESS MORE DIFFICULT. >>. DASHA BURNS, LIVE IN MONTGOMERY, WANTS TO UNTANGLE AND TALK TO. THANKS SO MUCH FOR KEEPING AN EYE ON ALL OF IT. >>>. WE'RE JUST LEARNING THAT ANOTHER SAILOR WAS ON A COMMERCIAL SHIP IS DEAD. THAT BRINGS THE TOTAL KILLED, NOW 23 AFTER AN ATTACK BY HOUTHI REBELS NEAR YEMEN. THIS SHOWS THE AFTERMATH. YOU CAN SEE THE DAMAGE BUT LOOKS LIKE SMOKE BILLOWING OFF THE SHIP. THIS MARKED THE FIRST TIME ANYBODY HAS BEEN KILLED IN THE HOUTHI ATTACKS. IS A TARGETED SHIPS IN THE RED SEA. IT HAPPENED ON A LIBERIAN OWNED SHIP WITH THE BARBADOS FLAG. IT RAISES THE POSSIBILITY THERE COULD BE ANOTHER ROUND OF STRIKES ON THE REBELS. HERE WE HAVE YET ANOTHER VERY DIFFICULT UPDATE. TONIGHT ANOTHER PERSON, ANOTHER SAILOR, KILLED. TALK AS FOR WHAT THE US RESPONSE CAN BE. >>. Reporter. WE ALSO LEARNED MOMENTS AGO THAT, IN FACT, SEVERAL OF THOSE INJURED CIVILIAN MARINERS ARE IN CRITICAL CONDITION. A VERY SERIOUS STRIKE HERE. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PICTURES OF THAT SHIP, IT IS ENORMOUS. THINK ABOUT HOW YOU CAN SEE THE SMOKE BILLOWING OUT AT THE END OF IT, JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF THE SCALE OF THE DESTRUCTION THAT THIS HOUTHI ANTIBALLISTIC MISSILE DID TO THIS CARGO SHIP. THIS HAPPENED EARLIER TODAY, ABOUT 60 MILES OFF OF THE COAST OF YEMEN, WHEN A MISSILE WAS FIRED FROM THE HOUTHI CONTROL- FIRED FROM THE HOUTHI CONTROL PART OF YEMEN. THEY HAVE BEEN ACTIVE IN THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS, FIRING FIVE ANTIBALLISTIC MISSILES AT SHIPS. THEY ACTUALLY HIT ANOTHER SHIP, ANOTHER MISSILE THAT WAS SHOT DOWN BUT TO OTHERS, LANDED JUST IN THE WATER, NOT IMPACTING ANYTHING. THEIR ACTIVITY HAS BEEN UP SIGNIFICANTLY. YOU MENTIONED A POSSIBLE RESPONSE. OFFICIALS SAY TONIGHT THEY ARE LOOKING AT POSSIBLE RESPONSES, WHAT WE HAVE SEEN RECENTLY IN OTHER HOUTHI ATTACKS WHEN THEY HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL. WE SEE THAT HE WAS A BRITISH MILITARY COME TOGETHER TO CONDUCT STRIKES. THE REALITY IS THEY DO NOT SEEM TO BE DETERRING THE HOUTHIS FROM CONTINUING THESE ATTACKS. >>. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >>>. COMING UP HOW, ELON MUSK, LET ME GIVE YOU A HAND. â™ª, â™ª, â™ª, â™ª, â™ª, â™ª, â™ª â™ª. >>>. TONIGHT, OFFICIAL SHARING MORE ABOUT THE VICTIM OF THAT HUGE FIRE IN MICHIGAN, THE ONE YOU ARE SEEING HERE. THE EXPLOSION IS COMING OUT OF A PLANT, LITERALLY SHAKING HOUSES NEARBY AND RAINING DOWN DEBRIS POLICE, DESCRIBED AS A VAPE DISTRIBUTION FACILITY THAT ILLEGALLY STORED GAS CANISTERS, ONE OF WHICH HELD THAT HIT A 19- YEAR-OLD, KILLING HIM. HE WAS AT A CAR WASH NEARBY. HE WAS AT A CAR WASH NEARBY. MAYBE WATCHING THE COMMOTION. OFFICIALS HAVE WORN SOME OF THE DEBRIS SCATTERED AROUND COULD STILL BE POTENTIALLY EXPLOSIVE. THE BIG QUESTION THEY ARE TRY TO ANSWER IS WHAT CAME FIRST. TO ANSWER IS WHAT CAME FIRST- THE FIRE OR THE EXPLOSION? WE HAVE SHOWN THE PICTURES AND YOU CAN'T OVERSTATE HOW DRAMATIC THIS WAS. SOME OF THESE EXPLOSIVE CANISTERS WENT FLYING SOMETHING LIKE A MILE. IT IS STILL DANGEROUS NEAR THE SITE. TALK TO US ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED AND WHERE THE INVESTIGATION GOES DOWN. >>. Reporter. THE LATEST INFORMATION IS UP TO TWO MILES AWAY. THAT IS HOW FAR THE DEBRIS WAS SCATTERED. THE WARNING FROM RESIDENTS IS THAT IF YOU SEE A CANISTER, DON'T TOUCH IT, BECAUSE IT COULD TOUCH IT, BECAUSE IT COULD STILL EXPLODE. WE HAVE SEEN SMALL FIRES REEMERGING THROUGHOUT THE DAY. INVESTIGATORS HOPE THEY CAN FULLY GET ON THE SITE TO START THE NEXT STEP TO PINPOINT. WHAT HAPPENED? WHAT LED TO THAT SERIES OF EXPLOSIONS? YOU TALKED ABOUT THE FLYING CANISTERS AND DEBRIS. THAT IS CANISTERS AND DEBRIS. THAT IS WHAT HIT THE 19-YEAR-OLD IN HIS HEAD. HIS FUNERAL IS PLANNED FOR THIS FRIDAY. HE WILL BE REMEMBERED AS A TEEN WHO WAS KIND AND SERVED IN HIS CHURCH MEANWHILE. PEOPLE BACK HERE IN THE COMMUNITY ARE STILL TALKING ABOUT WHAT THEY SAW. >>. WHAT I FELT WAS THE WHOLE WORLD, THE EARTH, SHAKING. IT WAS PRETTY, BAD AND SCARY. IT NEVER STOPPED. IT NEVER STOPPED. THE EXPLOSIONS NEVER STOPPED. THE EXPLOSIONS NEVER STOPPED. >>. Reporter. WHAT WAS EXPLODIN HALLE? THOSE CANISTERS THAT CONTAINED BUTANE AT LEAST HALF REMAIN AFTER THE BUSINESS OWNERS RECENTLY. BUSINESS OWNERS RECENTLY RECEIVED A SHIPMENT. ALSO, INSIDE OF A BACK ROOM, ACCORDING TO CITY OFFICIALS, WAS A PALLET OF NITROUS OXIDE ALONG WITH LIGHTER FLUID AUTHORITIES TELLING US. THE BUILDING THAT WAS HERE BEFORE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A RETAIL OPERATION OPERATION >>>. NOW TO ELON MUSK PUTTING TO BED QUESTIONS ABOUT WHO WE SUPPORTING IN THE 2024 ELECTION, AT LEAST, WHEN IT COMES TO DOLLARS, THE ANSWER SEEMS TO BE NOBODY. SEEMS TO BE NOBODY. IN A POST TODAY, HE WROTE: I AM NOT DONATING MONEY TO EITHER CANDIDATE FOR US PRESIDENT. HE KIND OF HAD TO COME OUT AND SAY THIS AFTER HE WAS SPOTTED. SAY THIS AFTER HE WAS SPOTTED AT MAR-A-LAGO THIS PAST WEEKEND, MEETING WITH DONALD TRUMP AND A FEW REPUBLICAN DONORS- THE WHOLE THING- RAISING A BUNCH OF QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER ELON MUSK WAS PUTTING HIS SUPPORT, OR MAYBE SOME OF HIS NEARLY $200 BILLION NET WORTH, BEHIND FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP, WHO IS LOOKING FOR CASH BRIAN CHEUNG, JOINS US NOW WITH MORE, EVEN IF MUSK DOESN'T MAKE DIRECT DONATIONS. BY THE WAY, THE LANGUAGE IS INTERESTING. THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT AREN'T CAMPAIGNS YOU CAN DONATE MONEY TO STILL. HE HAS A LOT OF WAYS IF HE WANTS TO, TO PUT HIS FINGER ON THE SCALE >>. Reporter. IT IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE HE IS ONE OF THE WEALTHIEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD. THERE ARE CERTAINLY OTHER WAYS. HE COULD PUT HIS THUMB ON THE SCALE. THAT IS BECAUSE OF HIS MASSIVE INFLUENCE. HE OWNS THE X PLATFORM WITH 175 MILLION FOLLOWERS, EVEN OUTSIDE OF THE PUBLIC, FACING ASPECT OF WHAT MUSCAT DOES AND SAYS. IT IS ALSO BEHIND THE SCENES. HE HAS MANY CONNECTIONS TO OTHER VERY WEALTHY PEOPLE. WE KNOW HE HAS A RELATIONSHIP WITH KANYE WEST, WHO ALSO HAS A LOT OF MONEY. MONEY COULD GO INTO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AS A RESULT OF HIS CONNECTIONS. EVEN IF NOT FROM HIM DIRECTLY, HE HAS BEEN TWEETING CLEARLY. IT IS NOT A SURPRISE THAT HE SUPPORTS THIS CANDIDATE OVER BIDEN BIDEN. FOR THAT REASON HE CAN CONTINUE TO SAY THINGS AND PERHAPS MISINFORMATION, AS HE IS DONE BEFORE TO PUT HIS THUMB ON THE SCALE. >>. AN NBC INVESTIGATION SHOWS THAT HE HAS WRAPPED UP 11 DIFFERENT REGULATORY BATTLES WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. HE IS UNIQUELY INVESTED WITH WHO ENDS UP IN THE WHITE HOUSE >>. Reporter. ABSOLUTELY A LOT OF HIS BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN WRAPPED UP IN REGULATORY ISSUES WHICH MUSK HAS BEEN VERY CLEAR IN SAYING: HOLDS HIM BACK. HE MIGHT BE IN FAVOR OF A CANDIDATE WHO WILL PARE BACK REGULATIONS AS TRUMP DID. I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT MUSK ISN'T NECESSARILY ONBOARD ENTIRELY WITH ALL THE POLICIES. REMEMBER A CONFERENCE HE APPEARED EARLIER THIS YEAR WHERE HE DID NOT GO FULL THROATED BEHIND TRUMP. >>. COULD YOU SEE YOURSELF VOTING FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN? VOTING FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN? >>. I THINK I WOULD NOT VOTE FOR BIDEN. >>. YOU WOULD VOTE FOR >>. REPORTER >>. I AM NOT SAYING I WOULD VOTE FOR TRUMP. THIS IS DEFINITELY A DIFFICULT. THIS IS DEFINITELY A DIFFICULT CHOICE HERE. >>. Reporter. A DIFFICULT CHOICE WE HAVE KNOWN, BASED OFF OF WHAT HE IS SAID SINCE THEN, THAT HE WOULD SUPPORT TRUMP OVER BIDEN. WOULD SUPPORT TRUMP OVER BIDEN. THAT LONG PAUSE WAS LONG. WHEN IT COMES TO THE OTHER TYPES OF POLICIES THAT ENTERS THE FOLD ON A VAGUELY TORY BASIS, HE WOULD PROBABLY PREFER THE FORMER PRESIDENT TO BIDEN. >>. 30,000 FOOT VIEW X CAN BE INCREDIBLY POWERFUL COME NOVEMBER IN WAYS THAT ARE PERHAPS USEFUL TO CANDIDATES IN THE CAMPAIGNS, AND WAYS THAT RE PERHAPS DANGEROUS WHEN IT COMES TO MISINFORMATION, TO MISINFORMATION >>. Reporter. WE HAVE TO REMEMBER HE HAS USED THIS PLATFORM FOR POLITICAL REASONS BEFORE WHEN HE TRIED TO LAUNCH THE RON DeSANTIS CAMP A THAT DID NOT GO WELL WITH THE TECHNICAL ISSUES, EVEN IF HE IS NOT THROWING MONEY. WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THIS PLATFORM IS AT A LOT OF BIG CHANGES SINCE HE TOOK A PRIVATE. THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT, EVEN IF HE IS GOING TO USE IT TO SAY WHATEVER HE WANTS TO SAY, WHETHER OR NOT HE WILL POLICE, THE OTHER TYPES OF MISINFORMATION THAT COULD COME FROM THE OTHER MILLIONS OF USERS ON THE PLATFORM. HERE IS THE STANCE WHEN IT. HERE IS THE STANCE WHEN IT COMES TO THE X POLICY ON VOTING AND CIVIC ENGAGEMENT. IT SAYS: ""YOU MAY NOT USE SERVICES FOR THE PURPOSES OF BEING ABLATING OR INTERFERING IN ELECTIONS OR OTHER CIVIC PROCESSES"". THAT INCLUDE SUPPRESSING PRESTIDIGITATION LIST, LEADING PEOPLE ABOUT HOW AND WHERE TO VOTE, OR INCITING VIOLENCE DURING AN ELECTION. THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT ARE CODIFIED IN THE POLICY BUT ENFORCING THAT IS A WHOLE SEPARATE QUESTION. IT IS A PRIVATE COMPANY WITH NO SHAREHOLDERS TO ANSWER TO. IT IS VERY MUCH AN OPAQUE PROCESS. >>. MUSK IS REALLY IN THE DRIVER SEAT. ON THAT ONE, BRIAN CHEUNG, THANK YOU SO MUCH, MUCH >>>. LET'S GET TO THE FIVE THINGS WE THINK YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT TODAY POLICE. SAY EIGHT STUDENTS WERE SHOT TODAY NEAR A SEPTA BUS IN PHILLY. ONE SHOT MULTIPLE TIMES AND NOW IN CRITICAL CONDITION. OFFICIALS SAY THEY WERE WAITING FOR THE BUS WITH THREE PEOPLE, GOT OUT OF THE CAR AND STARTED FIRING POLICE AND SAID THEY'RE WORKING TO MAKE SURE THAT SOMEBODY IS HELD RESPONSIBLE >>>. FEDERAL PROSECUTOR SERGEY AMANDA, TEXAS, WITH TRYING TO SCAM THIS GUY. YOU NOT RECOGNIZE HIM? FORMER CONGRESSMAN GEORGE SANTOS AND THREE OTHER PEOPLE? THE FBI SAYS HE TOLD THESE PEOPLE THAT THIS PERSON COULD HELP, GET CRIMINAL CHARGES DROPPED BUT, SAYS THE SUSPECT ADMITTED IN AN INTERVIEW, HE NEEDED MONEY BACK TO PAY GAMBLING DEBTS>>>. PARALYMPICS OFFICIALS SAY SAYING ATHLETES FROM RUSSIA AND BELARUS WILL NOT GET TO MARCH IN THE OPENING CEREMONY IN PARIS THIS SUMMER. THAT IS EVEN STRICTER THAN THE OLYMPICS WHICH WILL LET THEM BE IN THE OPENING CEREMONY AS NEUTRAL ATHLETES WITHOUT THEIR COUNTRY FLAT BEFORE. -- BECAUSE OF THE WAR IN UKRAINE. >>>. DORITOS SAYS IT IS CUTTING TIES WITH THE TRANSGENDER INFLUENCER. A PARTNER WITH IN SPAIN IS PARKED A BIG BOYCOTT CAMPAIGN. ONLINE, IT IS STATEMENT. THE DORITOS PARENT COMPANY, PEPSICO, SAID IT WASN'T BECAUSE OF THE BOYCOTT BUT CONTROVERSIAL POSTS THE INFLUENCER HAD MADE. >>>. A NEW STUDY SAYS ANCIENT STONE TOOLS FOUND IN UKRAINE ARE MORE THAN 1 MILLION YEARS, ARE MORE THAN 1 MILLION YEARS OLD AND MAY BE, ACCORDING TO ARCHAEOLOGISTS, THE EARLIEST EVIDENCE OF HUMANS IN YOUR THEY THINK THEY MIGHT'VE BEEN USED AS PRIMITIVE KNIVES TO CUT MEAT. >>>. COMING UP? THE NEW WARNING FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT, THE PRESS EVERY SUNDAY ON NBC. >>> NEWS LIVES IN THE NOW. >>. LOOK AT THIS. >> LET'S BREAK DOWN WHAT WE KNOW >>. NEWS FOR THE GENERATION OF NOW IS NBC NEWS NOW. NOW IS NBC NEWS NOW >>>. NBC NEWS COVERS HUNDREDS OF INTERNATIONAL STORIES EVERY DAY BECAUSE IT CAN BE TOUGH TO READ OR WATCH OR LISTEN TO THEM. ALL OUR TEAMS AROUND THE WORLD HAVE DONE THAT. FOR YOU, HERE'S A LOOK AT WHAT THEY'RE WATCHING OUT OF MEXICO. LOOK AT THIS VIDEO OF A PICKUP TRUCK RAMMING INTO THE DOORS OF THE NATIONAL PALACE IN MEXICO CITY. TODAY IT IS WHERE THE PRESIDENT LIVES. THE GROUP SMASHED THE DOOR AND SEVERAL ENDED UP INSIDE THEIR DEMANDING ANSWERS FROM MORE THAN 40 STUDENTS WHO WENT MISSING MORE THAN A DECADE AGO. THERE ARE CALLS THAT THERE IS AN ALLEGED COVER. THE PRESIDENT SAID THE PLAN IS TO CREATE A PROVOCATION. >>>. POPE FRANCIS HAVING A TOUGH TIME CLIMBING THE STEPS BACK ONTO HIS POPE MOBILE TODAY. HE NEEDED A WHEELCHAIR. HE NEEDED A WHEELCHAIR. HE IS 87.. WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT HOW HE IS BEEN DEALING WITH THE FLU AND LINGERING HEALTH ISSUES. THE POPE ALSO HAD AN AIDE. READ HIS REMARKS, WHICH HE HAS DONE THE PAST FEW DAYS >>>. IN GERMANY IN NEW STUDY, OUT ON A MAN WHO GOT A COVID SHOT 200 PLUS TIMES. HE IS 62.. GUESS WHAT, AFTER ALL THE SHOTS, MULTIPLE HUNDREDS OF SHOTS, NO NEGATIVE HUNDREDS OF SHOTS, NO NEGATIVE HEALTH EFFECTS- IS IMMUNE RESPONSE. DO NOT GET ANY BETTER OR WORSE. A PROSECUTOR OPENED AN INVESTIGATION INTO NEVER GIVING OUT VACCINATION CARDS AND FRAUD, BUT NO CHARGES WERE FILED. TO BE CLEAR, RESEARCHERS SAY THEY DO NOT ENDORSE THE SO CALLED HYPER VACCINATION TO IMPROVE IMMUNITY. OTHER WORDS: DON'T TRY THAT AT HOME. >>>. THE STATE DEPARTMENT SAYING THAT AMERICA TO GET OUT OF HAITI AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF HOW DANGEROUS IT IS GETTING. THAT IS AS THE US GOVERNMENT URGES THE HAITIAN MINISTER TO SPEED UP HIS OWN RESIGNATION AND A TRANSITION TO DEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS, AS THE COUNTRY IS CLOSE TO THE BRINK OF THE CIVIL WAR. THE STATE DEPARTMENT SAYING A FEW HOURS AGO, THEY'RE NOT FEW HOURS AGO, THEY'RE NOT PUSHING >>. WE ARE NOT CALLING ON HIM, ARE PUSHING FOR HIM TO RESIGN, BUT WE ARE URGING HIM TO EXPEDITE THE TRANSITION TO AN EMPOWERED AND INCLUSIVE GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE THAT WILL MOVE WITH URGENCY TO HELP THE COUNTRY PREPARE FOR A MULTINATIONAL SUPPORT MISSION AND TO PAVE THE WAY FOR FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS >>. THE ADMINISTRATION IS TIPTOEING CAREFULLY. THE PRIME MINISTER, NOW ON AMERICAN SOIL IN PUERTO RICO, IS NOT ABLE TO FIGHT BACK BECAUSE THE AIRPORT IN HAITI IS TARGETED BY ASSAULT. GABE GUITERREZ JOINS US NOW. THE US IS IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS VERY DELICATE POWER STRUGGLE HERE. I THINK YOU HEARD IT A LITTLE BIT FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT. WORDS MATTER IN DIPLOMACY. IN THIS INSTANT, WORDS DEFINITELY MATTER TRUCK. THAT'S RIGHT. -- >>. Reporter, THAT'S RIGHT. THEY SAID: THEY'RE NOT PRESSURING THE PRIME MINISTER TO RESIGN. THEY JUST WANT HIM TO LEAVE A LITTLE FASTER. THEY ARE CHOOSING THEIR WORDS VERY CAREFULLY HERE. HERE IS SOME OF WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS ITINERARY HAD TO. HOUSE PRESS ITINERARY HAD TO SAY: >> WHERE DEADLY NOT PUSHING THE PRIME MINISTER TO RESIGN. THAT IS NOT HAT WE ARE DOING. WE HAVE UNDERSCORED THAT NOW IS THE TIME TO FINALIZE A POLITICAL ACCORD TO HELP SET HAITI ON THE PATH TO A BETTER FUTURE. THAT IS SOMETHING WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON SOME TIME. >>. Reporter. THE WHITE HOUSE WALKING THAT VERY FINE LINE. AS YOU SAID, THIS ALL COMES AS THE PRIME MINISTER IS NOW IN PUERTO RICO. THE WHITE HOUSE ALSO SAY: THEY'RE NOT HELPING THE PRIME MINISTER. AT THIS POINT, IT IS UNCLEAR WHEN HE PLANS TO RETURN TO HAITI. HE CAME TO POWER BACK IN 2021, FOLLOWING THE ASSASSINATION OF THE PRESIDENT. THIS IS THE ESCALATION. OVER THE WEEKEND, THERE WAS A PRISON BREAK IN THE COUNTRY. HAITI IS SLIDING FURTHER AND FURTHER INTO CHAOS AT THIS POINT >>. LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT CHAOS. WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE AIRPORT GETTING TARGETED. I THINK IT IS THE SAME ONE YOU VISITED WHEN HE WENT TO HAITI NOT TOO LONG AGO. THE CONCERN IS TIMING. IF THE SECURITY SITUATION KEEPS GETTING WORSE, IF THESE ATTACKS KEEP HAPPENING, THE SCOPE OF WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE, WHAT THE US COULD DO, GETS MORE AND MORE NARROW. >>. Reporter. EXACTLY, OPTIONS ARE LIMITED HERE. THE YOU HAS -- THE US HAS BEEN INVOLVED WITH HAITI EVEN SINCE THE 90s, FOLLOWING THE MILITARY COUP. THE US HAD TO GET INVOLVED THERE WITH A MULTINATIONAL FORCE. NOW THE QUESTIONS BECOME: WHAT OPTIONS THE US HAS? THE WHITE HOUSE HAS BEEN INSISTED. THEY WILL NOT SEND AMERICAN BOOTS ON THE GROUND TO HAITI BUT NOW THIS MULTINATIONAL SECURITY FORCE LED BY KENYA, WHEN WILL THAT TAKE EFFECT? WHAT OPTIONS DOES THE US HAVE IF THE PRIME MINISTER DOES NOT WANT TO GET OUT OF POWER? A LOT OF QUESTIONS REMAINING AT. A LOT OF QUESTIONS REMAINING AT THIS POINT BUT THE MAJOR QUESTION RIGHT NOW FOR THE US: HOW MUCH DOES IT PLAN TO GET INVOLVED? AND YOU KNOW WHEN WILL THESE KINGS? THESE ARE BEGINNINGS. IN HAITI, THE NOW CONTROL ABOUT 80% OF PORT-au-PRINCE. WILL THEY ACCEPT ANYTHING IN THE RESIGNATION OF THE PRIME MINISTER? >>> COMING UP A PLAN THAT. >>. IMPORTANT NEWS IS OUR ABOUT YOUR MONEY. >> MENTAL HEALTH- BIG PICTURE. WHY IS IT SO TOUGH RIGHT NOW? >> NEWS FOR THE GENERATION OF NOW IS NBC NEWS NOW. NOW IS NBC NEWS NOW. >>>. TODAY, TSA IS ROLLING OUT SOMETHING THAT COULD CHANGE: THE FUTURE OF CHECKPOINT AT THE AIRPORT. A SIX-MONTH PLAN. THAT IS KIND OF LIKE A SELF CHECKOUT AT THE GROCERY STORE. IT IS ONLY IN VEGAS FOR NOW AND ONLY FOR PEOPLE WITH PRE-CHECK FOR NOW. WE KNOW THE ROUTINE. TOM COSTELLO KNOWS THE ROUTINE. HE TRIED IT FOR HIMSELF. >> Reporter, YOU COME UP TO THE CHECKPOINT, TAKE YOUR CARRY-ON AND PUT IT IN. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, SIMPLY ASK THE OFFICER ON DEMAND. >> HOW MAY I HELP YOU TODAY? >> Reporter, SLIDE IT ONTO THE ROLLERS AND WALK RIGHT INTO THE SCANNER. PUT YOUR ARMS DOWN TO THE SIDE. IT LOOKS FOR ANYTHING THAT SHOULD NOT BE THERE. IT IS TELLING ME. I HAVE TO COME BACK OUT. I HAVE A MICROPHONE THAT IT HAS DETECTED OF COURSE. I HAVE THE TRANSMITTER AND SOMETHING. A LOT OF PEOPLE FORGET MY CELL PHONE. >> LOOK AT YOU. >> LOOK AT YOU. WHAT AN ACTIVE STAND UP YOU ARE SHOWING AND TELLING WILL COMES UP FOR ME. IS YOU KNOW YOU ARE AT THE GROCERY STORE DOING SELF CHECKOUT- 50/50 SHOT. YOU DON'T MAKE IT THROUGH EASILY. SOMETHING GOES WRONG. IS THIS GOING TO E HELPFUL? I AM A LITTLE SKEPTICAL. >>. Reporter. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THE TSA IS TRYING TO MODEL FROM THE OLD CHECKOUT EXPERIENCE AT THE LOCAL GROCERY STORE. DO YOU REMEMBER HOW TO SCAN YOUR BANANAS? I CAN NEVER REMEMBER THE CODE. >> IT SAYS ERROR. >>. Reporter. NOW, FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE IT DOWN, PAT THE THINKING IS THE SAME THING MIGHT BE TRUE IN THE TSA CHECKPOINT. IF YOU ARE PRE-CHECK, IF YOU FLY ALL THE TIME AND KNOW HOW TO MAKE THIS MOVE, THIS MAY BE FOR YOU. YOU MAY BE ABLE TO MAKE THIS WORK. I ASKED THE TSA CHIEF: IS THIS SOMETHING THEY CAN ROLLOUT NATIONWIDE, MAYBE NOT SO FAST. >>. DON'T EXPECT THIS TO BE. >>. DON'T EXPECT THIS TO BE WIDELY ROLLED OUT. WE ARE VERY EARLY IN THE PROCESS. PART OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS FIGURE OUT WHAT WORKS: WILL FACILITATE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE, AT THE SAME TIME MAKING SURE TO PROVIDE THE SECURITY WE PROVIDE. >>. Reporter. 2.5 MILLION PEOPLE GOING THROUGH TSA CHECKPOINT EVERY DAY. A LITTLE HEADLINE FOR YOU. IF YOU ARE GOING ON SPRING BREAK, TSA SAYS IT WILL BE EVEN BIGGER THAN LAST YEAR, WHICH WAS A RECORD WERE ALL USING PASSENGER VOLUMES UP 6% OVER LAST YEAR. >>. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY: TOM PACK YOUR PATIENCE. HAVE YOU HEARD THAT ONE BEFORE? >>. Reporter. THAT IS A. >> Reporter: THAT IS A TRADEMARK. >>. HERE IS A QUESTION. THE REASON WE GO THROUGH THESE CHECKPOINTS IS NOT TO ANNOY ALL OF US AND SLOW US DOWN. IT IS FOR SECURITY AND KEEP US SAFE ON THE PLANE. HOW DO THEY NAVIGATE THAT? WE ALWAYS SEE IMAGES EVERY YEAR OF THE CRAZY THINGS PEOPLE LEAVE AT CHECKPOINTS THAT ARE CONFISCATED SAFETY VERSUS SPEED. HOW DO THEY NAVIGATE THAT? >>. Reporter WAS ALSO AT HIS. >>. Reporter WAS ALSO AT HIS DOOR -- UNDERSCORE. IT WAS HELD UP AFTER 9/11.. THERE IS STILL CONFISCATING RECORD NUMBERS OF GUNS EVERY YEAR. THAT IS A BIG QUESTION. CAN THE STILL ACHIEVE EXPEDITION BUT AT THE SAME TIME HAVE A SECURE CHECKPOINT? THERE IS ALSO THIS GOING ON. THAT IS THE CONCERN ABOUT WHERE WE ARE AND THE COMPETITIVENESS IN TERMS OF OTHER COUNTRIES. AND HOW WILL YOU? -- WELL, THEY SCREEN PASSENGERS. WE ARE NUMBER 17 IN TERMS OF COMPETITIVENESS. THAT IS BASED ON, AMONG OTHER THINGS. HOW COULD THE AIRPORT IS? ARE THEY CRUMBLING? -- THIS IS NATIONWIDE. >>. BREAK IN IS PULLING UP THE AVERAGE BUT MAYBE ANOTHER AIRPORT PULLS THAT DOWN? >>. Reporter. THAT WAS AN EDITORIAL ON YOUR PART. I THINK IT IS A LITTLE GLITCHY. IT MAY BE TOO MUCH TO ASK A PASSENGERS RIGHT NOW. >>. WE WILL SEE >>. Reporter. IF YOU CAN'T, >>. Reporter. IF YOU CAN'T REMEMBER THE BANANA CODE, IF IT A CHANCE TO START FRESH, WE WANT TO WELCOME YOU INTO SHARE. A MOMENT THAT BRIGHTENS YOUR DAY BEUSE EVERYDAY, YOUR DAY BEUSE EVERYDAY DESERVES THE BEST START>>>. IN DEPTH REPORTING ON A TOPIC WE HAVE BEEN WATCHING TONIGHT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. TONIGHT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NUCLEAR POWER AND AI. THOSE TWO WORDS TOGETHER. FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE MAY FEEL A LITTLE SCARY NUKES AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. FOR OTHERS IT MAY BRING BACK FRIGHTENING MEMORIES OF DISASTERS LIKE THREE MILE ISLAND OR CHERNOBYL. BUT A NEW GENERATION OF ENTREPRENEURS AT A SILICON VALLEY WANT TO BUILD NEWER AND SAFER PLANS TO POWER THE FUTURE OF AI. >>. Reporter. THIS REMOTE SITE IN EASTERN IDAHO COULD SOON BE THE BIRTHPLACE OF A NEW NUCLEAR, THE BIRTHPLACE OF A NEW NUCLEAR AGE. >> THE REPROCESSING AND PREFABRICATION OF HIGHLY RADIOACTIVE FUEL >>. Reporter. THE IDAHO NATIONAL LAB IS A RESEARCH FACILITY WERE, IN THE 1970s, THE US GOVERNMENT EXPERIMENTED WITH A SAFER KIND OF NUCLEAR REACTOR. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PUT THERE EARLY RESEARCH REACTORS OUT HERE, BECAUSE IT IS FULL OF UNDERGROUND WATER AND, FRANKLY, THERE IS NO ONE OUT HERE. DECADES AFTER, THE PLANT STOPPED RUNNING. A SILICON VALLEY COMPANY WANTS TO BUILD A NEW VERSION, A 15 MEGAWATT REACTOR CALLED AURORA. THE REACTOR WILL USE LIQUID METAL AS COOLANT LEFT OVER NUCLEAR WASTE FROM THE GOVERNMENT AS FUEL. THIS IS A PLACE WHERE THEY RECOVER THE FUEL. >> THAT WE FABRICATE IT. >>. Reporter. THE CEO HAS BEEN WORKING IN NUCLEAR SINCE HE WAS 16 AND A VICIOUS HIS REACTOR POWERING A TOWN OR FACTORY. >>.

COMMISSION SAID THEY HAD NOT PROVIDED ENOUGH SAFETY INFORMATION. THE COMPANY IS WORKING TO SATISFY REGULATORS. >>. YOU HAVE TO USE PHYSICS, NEW MODELS AND ALL SORTS OF STUFF DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THEY ARE USED TO. A LOT OF THINGS THEY ARE USED TO DON'T APPLY. THEY ARE INSURING THIS MEET ADEQUATE SAFETY REQUIREMENTS. >>. Reporter. IN IDAHO FALLS, PEOPLE SEEM PRETTY COMFORTABLE WITH THE IDEA. >> I THINK IT IS GREAT. >>. Reporter, YOUR PRETTY COMFORTABLE WITH NUCLEAR POWER? >> OH YEAH. >>. Reporter, A GROWING NUMBER OF AMERICANS FEEL THE SAME, BUT CRITICS ARGUE NUCLEAR SALSA: PROBLEM FOR TECH CEOs AND NOT FOR HUMANITY. >> IF YOU WERE TO INTEGRATE GPT STYLE MODELS INTO SEARCH ENGINES, IT IS GOING TO COST FIVE TIMES AS MUCH, FIVE TIMES AS MUCH, ENVIRONMENTALLY AS STANDARD. I WANT TO SEE INNOVATION IN THIS COUNTRY. I JUST WANT THE SCOPE OF INNOVATION TO BE DETERMINED BEYOND YOU KNOW THE INCENTIVE, BEYOND YOU KNOW THE INCENTIVE STRUCTURES OF THESE GIANT COMPANIES. >>. Reporter. COULDN'T WE JUST CUT BACK ON ENERGY CONSUMPTION? WHY DO WE NEED MORE TO FEED OUR SOCIETY? MORE AND MORE POWER? >> YEAH, I WILL ANSWER THAT IN TWO WAYS. WE HAVE ALWAYS SEEN A DIRECT CORRELATION BETWEEN ENERGY ABUNDANCE AND ALL ASPECTS OF QUALITY OF LIFE NOT TO MENTION. WE ARE ALSO TRYING TO DECARBONIZE. WE'RE STILL SO FAR AWAY FROM ELECTRIFYING VEHICLES. THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY WE NEED TO DO THAT IS HUGE, SERVING HUMANITY'S INTERESTS. SERVING HUMANITY'S INTERESTS- ARE WE TRYING TO LIVE WITH MORE POWER, OR ARE WE TRYING TO LIVE WITH LESS? >>. THESE ARE DIFFICULT AND REALLY INTENSE QUESTIONS.

WE EXPECT THE PRESIDENT TO SPEAK ANY MOMENT, LIKELY FOLLOWING THE SAME THEMES, FROM HIS FIERY STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS, WHERE HE LAID OUT HIS PLAN OF ATTACK AGAINST FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AND HE MADE THE CASE THAT ANYONE HIS AGE IS NOT THE NUMBER PEOPLE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT. BUT RATHER FOU, AS IN FOUR MORE YEARS, HE WANTS IN THE WHITE HOUSE, WANTS IN THE WHITE HOUSE.

THEY BEAT EXPECTATIONS AND WE WILL TALK MORE ABOUT THOSE NUMBERS- PRETTY GOOD. WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT LATER ON IN THE SHOW AND YOU CAN SEE THE POLE HERE.

MONICA ALBA IS THERE ON THE GROUND IN PENNSYLVANIA TALKING TO VOTERS AND PART OF WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE CAMPAIGN WANTED TO ANSWER. TOM IS THAT QUESTION ON THE MINDS OF MANY AMERICANS. WHAT AGE BE A FACTOR? HOW WOULD THEY JUDGE HIS STAMINA? WHAT DID THEY THINK OF HIS IDEAS? DOES HE SEEM UP FOR ANOTHER FOUR YEARS? AND SO THOSE WERE SOME SNAPSHOTS ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE ARE THINKING TODAY. TOM >>. YOU KNOW I HEARD FOLKS TODAY KELLY SAYING HE NEEDS TO BRING THAT LEVEL OF ENERGY: PASSION ANGER, WHATEVER IT WAS. PASSION ANGER, WHATEVER IT WAS LAST NIGHT. HE NEEDS TO BRING THAT TO THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL AND EVERY SINGLE SPOT AND HE'S GOT HIS CABINET ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL RIGHT >>. Reporter. PART OF WHAT IS A TRADITIONAL OUTREACH THAT HAPPENED IN NON-CAMPAIGN YEARS, WHERE MEMBERS OF THE CABINET ARE TRYING TO WORK ON POLICY. OBVIOUSLY, EVERYTHING IS IN A HYPER LEVEL OF ATTENTION BEUSE. IT IS A CAMPAIGN YEAR AND AN UNUSUAL ONE ONE DURING AND AN UNUSUAL ONE ONE DURING A TIME OF DIVIDED POLITICS. YES, MEMBERS OF THE CABINET WHO WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR HELPING IMPLEMENT BIDEN'S POLICIES THAT HAVE BEEN ENACTED. THOSE ON THE PLAN FOR THE REMAINDER OF HIS CURRENT TERM AND IF THERE IS ANOTHER TERM, THEY ARE SPINNING OUT NOT ONLY TO BATTLEGROUND STATES BUT ALL DIFFERENT REGIONS OF THE COUNTRY, AND THEY ARE THERE TO TALK ABOUT ISSUES THAT FALL IN THEIR LANE. YOU'VE GOT THE ENERGY SECRETARY TALKING ABOUT CLIMATE ISSUES. YOU HAVE OUTREACH TO SPECIAL COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES THAT ARE IN THE BASE OF THE PRESIDENT, THOSE THAT ARE TALKING ABOUT SPECIFIC INFRASTRUCTURE, SPENDING ALL OF THOSE THINGS TO MAGNIFY THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE, NOT ONLY ON THE PERSONALITY ISSUES BUT THE IDEAS, POLICIES, SPECIFIC STEPS. THE ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO TAKE. THE ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO TAKE AND SAY THEY CAN TAKE IF THEY GET FOUR MORE YEARS, TOM. >>. KELLY O'DONNELL, THANK YOU. >>>. TONIGHT, FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP IS EXPECTED TO SIT DOWN WITH THE PRIME MINISTER OF HUNGARY, BRINGING TOGETHER THE TWO MEN MOST ASSOCIATED WITH THIS PARTICULAR BRAND OF CONSERVATISM ON THEIR RESPECTIVE CONTINENTS. THE HUNGARIAN PRIME MINISTER IS A LONGTIME ALLY OF FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP AND A TOLERATED PRESIDENT TRUMP AND A TOLERATED ALLY IN NATO, WHOM MR TRUMP BASHED THROUGH HIS PRESIDENCY. HE IS OFTEN COMPARED IT TO MR TRUMP, AMONG OTHER REASONS FOR ANTI-IMMIGRANT STATEMENTS AND POLICIES. VAUGHN HILLYARD IS FOLLOWING ALL OF THIS, FOR US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DON'T USUALLY GET VISITS FROM FOREIGN LEADERS, AND THE ORBAN IS WIDELY ACCUSED OF BEING AN AUTHORITARIAN, WHY MIGHT TRUMP BE SITTING DOWN WITH THEM NOW? >>. Reporter WELL TRUMP VIEWS VIKTOR ORBAN AS NOT ONLY A FOREIGN ALLY BUT ALSO ONE HERE DOMESTICALLY, I CAN TELL YOU AFTER HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH VOTERS ON THE GROUND. YOU HEAR FOLKS TALK ABOUT ORBAN BECAUSE, HONESTLY, TRUMP BRINGS HIM UP A LOT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL, SUGGESTING LEADERS AROUND THE COUNTRY NEED TO LOOK AT THE COMPARISONS BETWEEN THE TWO. TAKE A LOOK AT THEIR STANCE ON IMMIGRATION, FOR EXAMPLE. DONALD TRUMP SAYS: IMMIGRANTS POISON, THE BLOOD OF THE COUNTRY. ORBAN SAYS: WE DO NOT WANT TO BE A MIXED RACE. RUSSIA CAN DO WHATEVER THE HELL THEY WANT. DONALD TRUMP SAID LAST MONTH- AND OF COURSE, IN THE LAST MONTH YOU KNOW THE FINAL COUNTRY TO APPROVE SWEDEN BEING -- BECOMING A MEMBER OF NATO. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT DEMOCRACY, DONALD TRUMP REPEATEDLY MAKING HIS ELECTION DENIAL CLAIMS COMPARED TO VIKTOR ORBAN, WHO HAS ALSO BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT. HE NOW HAS A FOURTH TERM IN OFFICE BACK IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. IN JANUARY, DONALD TRUMP SAID ON STAGE THAT VIKTOR ORBAN WAS A GREAT LEADER, A STRONG LEADER, AND MAKING THE CASE. THAT IS WHY A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T LIKE HIM. DONALD TRUMP WENT ON TO SAY: ""IT IS NICE TO HAVE A STRONG MAN RUNNING YOUR COUNTRY"". OF COURSE DONALD TRUMP INTENDS TO BE A STRONG MAN. THE SAME WAY, VIKTOR ORBAN IS OVERSEEING LIBERAL DEMOCRACY HERE IN THE UNITED STATES TO TRY TO EMULATE HIM >>. HE HAS VIRTUALLY SQUASHED DEMOCRACY IN HUNGARY AND HE CONTROLS THE MEDIA BY THE WAY. YESTERDAY, SWEDEN OFFICIALLY JOINED NATO. AFTER ORBAN FINALLY LIFTED THAT BLOCK. IF MR TRUMP IS REELECTED, THERE IS ALREADY TALK. HE AND ORBAN COULD UNDERMINE NATO EVEN AS THE RUSSIA THREAT IS GROWING MORE SERIOUS >>. Reporter RIGHT AND WE HEARD JOE BIDEN STATUS AT THE STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS CONCERNS ABOUT DEMOCRACY AND THE ROLE THE US, DEMOCRACY AND THE ROLE THE US PLAYS OVERSEAS AND AS PART OF THE NATO ALLIANCE. SWEDEN IS THE 32nd MEMBER OF NATO, BUT IT WAS HUNGARY THAT WAS THE FINAL MEMBER COUNTRY TO HOLD UP APPROVING SWEDEN TO BECOME PART OF NATO. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE EU AND INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT FOR UKRAINE AIDED TO UKRAINE IN THEIR EFFORTS TO DEFEND THE COUNTRY FROM RUSSIA, THAT WAS JUST IN THE LAST MONTH. THAT FINALLY, UNDER PRESSURE, VIKTOR ORBAN AND HUNGARY, WAS THE FINAL EU COUNTRY TO SIGN OFF ON $50 BILLION IN AID ROLLING FROM THE EU TO UKRAINE. OF COURSE, DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF EXPRESSING CONCERN OR HESITANCY FROM THE US TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE AID TO UKRAINE. SO DONALD TRUMP USED ORBAN TO GET BACK IN THE WHITE HOUSE AS A LEADER ON THAT FRONT >>. ORBAN WAS VERY CLOSE TO VLADIMIR PUTIN. VAUGHN, THANK YOU. >>>. NEXT WEEK, THE HOUSE WILL VOTE ON A BILL THAT COULD GET TIKTOK AND IN THE US. IT IS A BIPARTISAN BILL AIMED TO GET TIKTOK'S PARENT COMPANY TO SELL THE OUT OR MAKE IT UNAVAILABLE IN THE UNITED STATES AND REMEMBER IT'S BASED OUT OF BEIJING. THE CHIEF CONCERN FROM LAWMAKERS AND CRITICS IS PROTECTING US DATA FROM THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT. IT IS A PRIVATE COMPANY NOT OWNED OR CONTROLLED BY THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT. THE BILLTHE SUPPORT OF THE HOUSE SPEAKER AND DVANCED OUT OF THE HOUSE ENERGY AND COMMERCE COMMITTEE WITH A 50-0 VOTE. TIKTOK IS TRYING TO FIGHT BACK, SENDING UP HIS NOTIFICATION TO USERS 18 AND OLDER, ASKING THEM TO CALL THEIR REPRESENTATIVES TO TELL THEM TO VOTE NO ON THE BILL. THAT SEEMS TO BE WORKING. WE ARE HEARING FROM LAWMAKERS WHO TELL OUR TEAM THEIR OFFICES HAVE BEEN FLOODED BY PHONE CALLS FROM ANG -- ANGRY CONSTITUENTS WHO LOVE TIKTOK. BRIAN CHEUNG JOINS US NOW. BRIAN, WHAT KIND OF IMPACT COULD THIS HAVE? IF YOU ARE A TEEN OR TWENTYSOMETHING, YOU LOVE TIKTOK? >>. Reporter. YES, AND THAT IS WHY SO MANY CONGRESSIONAL OFFICES WERE GETTING FLOODED WITH CALLS YESTERDAY BUT LET'S UNPACK. WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED HERE? THE BILL PASSED THE HOUSE COMMERCE COMMITTEE YESTERDAY AND WHAT IT PROPOSES TO DO IS TO FORCE THE HOLDING COMPANY, A CHINESE COMPANY, TO SELL TIKTOK WITHIN 180 DAYS OF THE ENACTMENT OF THE BILL, AND IT OFFERS NARROW PROFITS FROM THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH DO SO AS WELL, AND IT IS THE FIRST PRONG THAT WILL BE USED TO ESSENTIALLY FORCE BYTEDANCE TO SELL THE COMPANY, OR IT WILL BE BAND NATIONWIDE. THIS BIPARTISAN BILL WOULD. THIS BIPARTISAN BILL WOULD SUGGEST ONCE IT DOES FACE A FULL FLOOR VOTE, WHICH THE HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER SAYS WILL COME SOMETIME NEXT WEEK. IT COULD FACE FULL PASSAGE. TAKE A LISTEN TO WHAT REPRESENTATIVE JEFFRIES ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE HAD TO SAY REGARDING THE MOMENTUM OF THIS BILL >>. IT IS IMPRESSIVE IN NATURE AND IN ANY INSTANCE, BUT PARTICULARLY AS IT RELATES TO SOMETHING IN THE SOCIAL MEDIA SPACE WHICH HASN'T ALWAYS BEEN EASY FOR DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS TO FIND COMMON GROUND >>. Reporter THAT WAS TOP MINORITY LEADER, HAKEEM JEFFRIES, AND HE'S TALKING ABOUT THAT 50, 0 VOTE AS A COMMUNITY -- COMMITTEE. THAT JUST GOES TO SHOW THEY ARE ON THE SAME SIDE, AT LEAST ON THIS FRONT >>. TIKTOK IS UNDER WAY RIGHT NOW TO GET USERS ON ITS SIDE, MY GOSH, THEY ARE RUNNING TV. MY GOSH, THEY ARE RUNNING TV COMMERCIALS SHOWING NUNS USING TIKTOK. WHAT IS BYTEDANCE SAYING? >>. Reporter, THEY ARE TRYING TO GET THEIR USERS TO CALL THEIR CONGRESSPERSON TO SAY: VOTE THIS DOWN. IN A STATEMENT, TIKTOK, SAID THE FOLLOWING THERE IS A PREDETERMINED OUTCOME IN THE UNITED STATES AND THIS WILL DESTROY THE PEOPLE BUILDING LIVELIHOODS. WE SPOKE TO ONE PERSON WHO SAID: THEY'VE BUILT A WHOLE LIVELIHOOD AND THAT THEY PROMOTE TO THEIR THOUSANDS OF FOLLOWERS ON TIKTOK. SO TIKTOK IS LEANING INTO THOSE USERS TO SHOOT DOWN THIS LEGISLATION, WHETHER OR NOT. IT IS SUCCESSFUL. AGAIN, IT IS A BIPARTISAN PUSH HERE, ONCE IT GETS TO THE SENATE. WE HAVE HEARD THE WHITE HOUSE SEEMS TO BE IN SUPPORT OF THIS, BECAUSE WE HEARD THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL SAY THEY THINK THIS IS A GOOD STEP. SO WE WILL HAVE TO SEE HOW THIS DEVELOPS. TOM >>. REALLY AN AMAZING DEVELOPMENT. BY THE WAY, SOME OF THESE PEOPLE FROM TIKTOK GO WANT TO GET TV AND MOVIE ROLES. THANK YOU SO MUCH, BRIAN CHEUN. >>>. RIGHT, NOW A TORNADO WATCH IS IN EFFECT FOR PARTS OF THE SOUTH AS THEY BRACE FOR WHAT COULD BE A DANGEROUS EVENING, WITH SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS MOVING ACROSS THE REGION. 6 MILLION PEOPLE NOW AT RISK FROM THESE INTENSE STORMS THAT STRETCH FROM TEXAS TO GEORGIA. ON TOP OF THAT, 14 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE SAME AREA ARE UNDER FLOOD WATCHES. LET'S BRING IN METEOROLOGIST BILL KARINS LOTS GOING ON HERE WITH THAT WEATHER MAP. LAY IT OUT FOR US. LAY IT OUT FOR US. HOW MIGHT -- A SERIOUS MIGHT- THESE STORMS BE? >>. WE KNOW HOW UNUSUALLY WARM IT HAS BEEN THIS MARCH. IT IS LIKE AN APRIL WEATHER PATTERN. WE EXPECT THESE KINDS OF STORMS STARTING NOW. WE WILL TAKE THIS RIGHT THROUGH THE DAY TOMORROW AND WRITE UP THE EAST COAST. HERE IS THE TORNADO WATCH, BATON ROUGE AND SECTIONS OF ALABAMA. THIS GOES FROM 9:00 THIS EVENING. NOTICE THIS ONE LITTLE RED BOX OVER HERE. WE HAVEN'T HAD THAT MANY TORNADO WARNINGS BUT THIS IS A FLASH FLOOD WARNING JUST SOUTH OF JACKSON: 1 TO 2 INCHES OF RAINFALL IN THIS AREA. TORNADO WARNING COMING OUTSIDE HATTIESBURG TO THE SOUTH, INCLUDING THIS AREA. THAT IS RADAR INDICATED. THE STORM CANNOT PRODUCE A TORNADO AT ANY TIME AND THERE IS A LOT OF RAIN WITH US. THAT IS WHY WE HAVE A GOOD VISUAL. THIS IS WHERE THE TORNADO SIRENS ARE GOING OFF. WE WILL KEEP YOU POSTED AS WE GET UPDATES ON THAT STORM. THIS IS THE MAP. WE JUST SHOWED YOU THE RISK AS WE GO THROUGH THE REST OF TODAY, THIS AREA IN RED. IF WE DID GET TORNADOES. THIS IS WHERE THEY WOULD LIKELY HAPPEN LATER THIS EVENING. THIS WILL SPREAD INTO AREAS OF GEORGIA. SATURDAY EVENING, A CHANCE FOR HEAVY RAIN. I SHOWED YOU THE AREAS ALONG THE MISSISSIPPI THAT ARE JUST GETTING DRENCHED TONIGHT. THE RAIN MOVES FROM ATLANTA AND OVER TO COLUMBUS. 2 TO 4 INCHES OF RAIN, ISOLATED TOTALS UP TO 6 INCHES. ON SATURDAY, SEVERE WEATHER POSSIBLE IN THE SOUTHEAST, MORE WIND DAMAGE THAN TORNADOES BUT THAT DOES INCLUDE AREAS IN SAVANNAH AND CHARLESTON TO THE NORTH RAINY. SATURDAY EVENING, OUTSIDE OF NEW YORK CITY AND PHILADELPHIA UNDER A FLOOD WATCH TOM. NORTHERN NEW ENGLAND WILL GET SNOW OUT OF THIS TOO. SO WE GOT EVERYTHING HEADING UP THE EAST COAST: >> SNOW MID-MARCH IN NEW ENGLAND. OKAY, BILL. THANK YOU SO MUCH, BUDDY. >>> THE PROSECUTION ZEROING IN ON WHAT THE FATHER OF A MASSIVE SCHOOL SHOOTER DID NOT TELL DETECTIVES WHEN HE SAT DOWN WITH THEM TO HELP PIECE TOGETHER WHAT HAPPENED THAT DAY? >> HE NEVER TOLD YOU THAT HE BOUGHT THE MURDER WEAPON FOUR DAYS AGO, DID HE? HE NEVER SAID HE BOUGHT THE MURDER WEAPON FOUR DAYS AGO AS A GIFT FOR HIS SON >> HE DID NOT APPEAR. >> HE DIDN'T TELL YOU THE GUN WAS LOCKED UP, DID HE? >> HE DID NOT. >>. IN FACT, HE REFERRED TO THIS. >>. IN FACT, HE REFERRED TO THIS AS A DOODLE ON PAPER RIGHT. >> CORRECT >>. THAT WAS JAMES CRUMBLEY IN COURT TODAY, DAY FOUR IN THE RARE CASE WHERE A PARENT OF A MASSIVE SCHOOL SHOOTER IS ON TRIAL FOR HIS SON'S ACTIONS. HIS SON OPENED FIRE AT OXFORD HIGH SCHOOL IN 2021, KILLING FOUR STUDENTS- ALL OF THEM MISSED, I WOULD IMAGINE, BY THEIR FRIENDS AND FAMILY MEMBERS. JAMES CRUMBLEY IS FACING MANSLAUGHTER- ONE CASE FOR EACH OF THOSE STUDENTS. HIS WIFE, JENNIFER, WAS CONVICTED ON THE SAME CHARGES LAST MONTH. NBC'S MAGGIE VESPA JOINS US NOW WITH MORE >>. Reporter: TOM. WE HEARD FROM SEVERAL PEOPLE TODAY, AND CERTAINLY THE MOST IMPACTFUL WAS NUMBER ONE: THE MANAGER OF A LOCAL GUN STORE WHO SAID SHE WAS WORKING THE DAY. JAMES CRUMBLEY CAME INTO THE SHOP WITH HIS SON, ETHAN CRUMBLEY, TO SHOP FOR A GUN. SHE SAID THEY WALKED INTO THE STORE LOOKING AT DIFFERENT GUNS. SHE SAID HE WANTED TO BUY GUNS. SHE SAID HE WANTED TO BUY ONE FOR QUITE SOME TIME. IT CAME WITH A LOCK THAT JAMES CRUMBLEY FAILED TO USE, ALLOWING ASSIGNED ACCESS TO IT. THAT SEEMS PIVOTAL FOR THE PROSECUTION. WE HEARD FROM AN ANALYST WHO TALKED ABOUT TEXT MESSAGES. ETHAN CRUMBLEY SENT TO A FRIEND PARTICULARLY SAYING: HE ASKED HIS PARENTS FOR HELP WITH HIS MENTAL HEALTH AND TOLD HIS FRIEND, ACCORDING TO THE TESTIMONY THAT HIS FATHER GAVE HIM SOME PILLS AND TOLD HIM TO ""SUCK IT UP"". MULTIPLE TIMES WE HEARD THE DEFENSE PUSHING BACK ON THE PROSECUTION'S THEORY. HERE IS ONE SUCH MOMENT, SPECIFICALLY TIED TO THOSE TEXT MESSAGES. TAKE A LISTEN. >> IN APRIL OF 2021, YOU SAID HE ASKED HIS PARENTS TO GO TO THE DOCTOR, RIGHT >> YES, HE WAS TALKING ABOUT HEARING VOICES AND STUFF LIKE THAT. >>. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT WAS ABOUT. RIGHT IN EXHIBITING NOW. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT COULD BE. >>. HE SAID HE WAS HEARING VOICES AND HE WAS DYING INSIDE. >>. Reporter. WE SHOULD NOTE THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME, TOM, WE HAVE HEARD THE CROSS EXAMINATION OF ANY WITNESSES. TODAY STILL THE PROSECUTION'S CASE AT THIS POINT, BUT IT COULD GET HANDED OVER TO THE DEFENSE NEXT WEEK. >> MAGGIE, THERE WAS NEW INFORMATION THAT COULD LIMIT HIS JAIL COMMUNICATIONS. HE WAS ALLEGEDLY MAKING THREATENING STATEMENTS. WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT? >>. Reporter. YES, THAT CAME THROUGH OVERNIGHT. THE LOCAL SHERIFF'S OFFICE GAVE US INTEL ABOUT THESE THREATS. AT THE END OF THE DAY YESTERDAY, AFTER THE JURY LEFT THE ROOM. THE JUDGE ISSUED AN ORDER LEAVING JAMES CRUMBLEY COMMUNICATIONS BUT DECLINED TO SAY IN COURT WHY THEY WANTED THAT THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE LATER CLARIFIED, SAYING: JAMES CRUMBLEY HAS BEEN MAKING THREATS OVER THE PHONE AND VIA ELECTRONIC MESSAGES. THEY DIDN'T SAY WHO HE WAS THREATENING WHEN THIS HAPPENED, ANY OF THE CONTENT OF THE THREATS BUT THERE IS THE JUDGE'S ORDER SAYING HIS PHONE AND TABLET PRIVILEGES HAVE ESSENTIALLY BEEN REVOKED, EXCEPT FOR COMMUNICATIONS WITH HIS LAWYERS AND LEGITIMATE CLERGY. LONG STORY SHORT. HE IS EFFECTIVELY LARGELY CUT OFF, EFFECTIVELY LARGELY CUT OFF FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE TRIAL >>. AND THE TRIAL CONTINUES NEXT WEEK. MAGGIE, THANK YOU SO MUCH >>>. THE US MILITARY SAYS ONE OF HIS MOST TROUBLED AIRCRAFT IS CLEARED FOR TAKEOFF. THIS COMES MONTH AFTER. EIGHT AIRMEN WERE KILLED WHEN A HELICOPTER CRASHED OFF THE COAST OF JAPAN THE NOVEMBER ACCIDENT, MARCH, THE FOURTH FATAL CRASH OVER A TWO YEAR PERIOD, KILLING A TOTAL OF 20 MEMBERS OF THE SERVICE. THE MILITARY SAYS THE LATEST CRASH HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH A GEARBOX BUT ACKNOWLEDGES IT IS STILL NOT SURE WHY THE PART FAILED, DESPITE THAT THE MILITARY SAYS THE MARINES NAVY AIR FORCE WILL RESUME FLIGHTS WITH THE OFFSPRING OVER THE COMING MONTHS. COURTNEY- KUBE IS FOLLOWING THIS FOR US. TAKE US THROUGH THE INVESTIGATION, COURTNEY. HOW DID INVESTIGATORS DETERMINE WHAT CAUSED THE CHOPPER TO GO DOWN? >>. Reporter WHAT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER HERE, TOM WHILE. INVESTIGATORS HAVE DETERMINED THE MATERIAL FAILURE OF THIS V 22,. THEY ARE NOT SHARING THAT PUBLICLY, EVEN THOUGH THEY KNOW WHAT CAUSED THE PART THAT FAILED, THAT CAUSED THIS CRASH OFF THE COAST OF JAPAN IN NOVEMBER. THEY DO NOT KNOW WHY THE PART IS THERE. THE PART THAT FAILED IS AN ISSUE WITHIN THE GEAR BOX AT THE TOP OF THE AIRCRAFT. IF YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE V 22 OSPREY, THAT IS WHERE THE ROTOR IS WHERE IT TILTS UP. A NUMBER OF OFFICIALS FAMILIAR WITH THE INVESTIGATION WERE TOLD THAT IS WHAT FAILED. AGAIN, INVESTIGATORS DON'T KNOW WHY THAT PART FAILED, DESPITE THAT THERE WAS A THREE MONTH LONG INVESTIGATION LEADING MILITARY OFFICIALS TODAY TO SAY THEY BELIEVE, BASED ON WHAT THEY KNOW AND BASED ON THE PROCEDURES PUT IN PLACE THAT THEY CAN PUT THE AIRCRAFT SAFELY BACK UP IN THE AIR. HERE IS HOW THEY DESCRIBED THE PROCESS AND WHAT THEY WERE WILLING TO SAY ABOUT IT. THEY SAY IT WAS A DATA-DRIVEN APPROACH, PRIORITIZING THE SAFETY OF THE MAINTENANCE AND PROCEDURAL CHANGES TO ADDRESS THE FAILURE AND ALLOW FOR A SAFE RETURN, AGAIN NOT SPECIFYING WHAT THAT FAILURE WAS: TOM >>. I AM GUESSING. THE REASON FOR THAT THERE ARE MILITARY SECRETS. YOU DON'T WANT TO ADVERTISE WHAT YOUR VULNERABILITY IS WITH A PARTICULAR PIECE OF EQUIPMENT THAT YOU RELY ON EVERY DAY. THAT, SAID, IS THE OSPREY THAT HAS HAD SO MANY PROBLEMS. COURTNEY, IS IT TOO BIG AND TOO IMPORTANT TO FAIL FOR THE MILITARY? >>. Reporter. THERE IS NO QUESTION. THIS IS A CRITICAL AIRCRAFT FOR THE MARINE CORPS DAVE THOUGHT ABOUT 350 OF THEM. IT IS SO IMPORTANT THAT, IN FACT NBC NEWS FIRST REPORTED BACK IN JANUARY, THEY ACTUALLY PUT A NUMBER OF THEM BACK UP IN THE AIR. DESPITE THIS GROUNDING FOR WHAT THEY CALLED OPERATIONAL NECESSITY. THE MARINES ARE QUICK TO POINT OUT. WHEN THEY PUT THE AIRCRAFT BACK UP IN THE AIR IN DJIBOUTI AND OTHER LOCATIONS, THEY STARTED IMPLEMENTING THESE NEW PROCEDURES, INCLUDING MORE MAINTENANCE CHECKS, INCLUDED PILOT REFRESHERS. YOU CAN SEE ON THE SCREEN. THIS IS WHAT THE MARINES ARE CALLING EGG CRAWL WALK RUN APPROACH TO SLOWLY PHASING THE AIRCRAFT BACK IN. SINCE THEY PUT THEM BACK UP IN THE AIR IN DJIBOUTI, THERE HAVE NOT BEEN ANY SAFETY ISSUES, TOM. >>. COURTNEY KUBE. THANK YOU SO MUCH. >>> COMING UP. THE US GOVERNMENT SAID NO, IT DID NOT COVER-UP THE EXISTENCE OF UFOs, WHAT THOSE PEOPLE HAVE REALLY BEEN SEEING IN THE SKIES. DON'T BELIEVE YOUR LYING EYES. >>>. PLUS, LITERALLY MOVED A LAKE MILES AWAY. THAT IS WHEN WE COME BACK. >>. I LOVE THAT. >>>. ONE OF THE WORLD'S BIGGEST COMPANIES SAYS JOBS CAN'T SEEM TO KICK RUSSIAN SPIES OUT OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT MICROSOFT. THE COMPANY SAYS RUSSIAN HACKERS, KNOWN AS MIDNIGHT BLIZZARD, HAVE GAINED ACCESS TO DIGITAL SECRETS INCLUDING SOURCE CODES, BASICALLY THE SCRIPT FOR MICROSOFT'S PROGRAMS, SCRIPT FOR MICROSOFT'S PROGRAMS AND INTERNAL EMAILS. THE HACKING GROUP HAS TIES TO RUSSIA'S VERSION OF A NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY AND IS THOUGHT TO BE BEHIND THE BIGGEST PACKS IN US HISTORY. THIS STORY WAS JUST POSTED TO NBCNEWSCOM. ONE WOULD THINK MICROSOFT HAS PRETTY ROBUST SECURITY PROTOCOLS IN PLACE. WHY IS IT STRUGGLING TO KICK RUSSIA -- RUSSIANS- OUT OF THE SYSTEM? >>. YOU ARE NOT THE ONLY ONE ASKING THAT. CRITICS ARE POINTING TO THE FACT. THIS IS A COMPANY, ONE OF THE MOST SOPHISTICATED TECH COMPANIES IN THE WORLD. AT THE SAME TIME, THIS IS RUSSIA'S A TEAM, THE GROUP BEING ACCUSED HERE. IN CYBER TERMS, HACKING GROUPS ARE KNOWN AS PERSISTENT THREATS. AND THESE GUYS ARE PERSISTENT PER MICROSOFT'S DESCRIPTION. THEY HAVE BEEN CONSTANTLY TRYING TO GET IN >>. AND WHY ARE THE HACKERS SPECIFICALLY TARGETING MICROSOFT? DO WE KNOW THAT? >>. I SPOKE WITH THE VICE PRESIDENT AT CROWDSTRIKE AND HE POINTED OUT: LOOK, IT'S MUCH OF A IWORK AND ALL KINDS OF NATO GOVERNMENTS AROUND THE WORLD. IF YOU WANT TO LOOK AT RUSSIA AS AN ELECTION INTERFERE. IT'S A LOT OF INTELLIGENCE. >>. KEVIN, THANK YOU SO MUCH. A LOT GOING ON THERE. THANKS VERY MUCH, KEVIN. >>> LET'S GET YOU OVER TO THE FIVE THINGS YOUR TEAM MAY WANT TO KNOW ABOUT TONIGHT. NUMBER ONE: A DEADLY CRASH IN WISCONSIN SHUT DOWN PART OF THE HIGHWAY THERE TODAY, POLICE SAY A SEMI TRACTOR AND A TRAILER HIT A VAN AT AN INTERSECTION. AT LEAST ONE PERSON DIED. POLICE ARE INVESTIGATING AND WILL GIVE US MORE DETAILS AS THEY BECOME AVAILABLE. >>> THREE CHARGED WITH CAPITAL MURDER AFTER THE DEATHS OF AN AMERICAN COUPLE WHEN THEY WERE THROWN OFF THEIR YACHT IN THE CARIBBEAN, THREE INMATES ESCAPED FROM PRISON. THEN HIJACKED THE YACHT AND PROBABLY TOSSED THOSE. TWO PEOPLE OVERBOARD. POLICE SAY IT IS UNLIKELY THE COUPLE SURVIVED. >>> GEORGE SANTOS- YOU MAY REMEMBER HIM, THE ONE, KICKED OUT OF CONGRESS AND CHARGED WITH CAMPAIGN DONORS. HE SAYS HE WILL RUN AGAIN AND FACE OFF IN THE LONG ISLAND. DISTRICT SANTOS PLEADED NOT GUILTY TO LYING TO CONGRESS AND USING CAMPAIGN DONATIONS FOR PERSONAL EXPENSES. HIS FELONY TRIAL IS SET FOR SEPTEMBER. AFTER THE PRIMARY >>> NUMBER FOUR. A UNITED AIRLINES PLANE ROLLED OFF THE RUNWAY. AFTER LANDING FROM MEMPHIS, 160 PEOPLE WERE ON BOARD. NO ONE HURT. THE FAA IS INVESTIGATING. ONE PLANE HAD TO MAKE AN EMERGENCY LANDING. AFTER, FLAMES SHOT OUT OF THE ENGINE. ANOTHER PLANE HAD A TIRE RIGHT. ANOTHER PLANE HAD A TIRE RIGHT- THERE FALL OFF AFTER LEAVING SAN FRANCISCO FOR JAPAN. THAT IS NOT SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN. >>>. STRONG WINDS IN DEATH VALLEY LITERALLY BLEW LIKE 2 MILES. YES, YOU HEARD THAT RIGHT- 40 MILE AN HOUR. WINDS PUSHED THE LAKE NORTH, MOVED BACK TO ITS INITIAL SPOT BUT IT IS NOW SHALLOWER AND MUDDIER. THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE WON'T LET PEOPLE BOAT THERE ANYMORE, AT LEAST FOR NOW. >>>. WHEN WE COME BACK, THE BIGGEST NAME IN COLLEGE BASKETBALL IS GETTING READY FOR HER BIGGEST GAME TONIGHT. HOW CAITLIN CLARK'S SURGING POPULARITY IS DRIVING SOLD-OUT CROWDS TO THE BIG TEN WOMEN'S TOURNAMENT >>> PLUS WHY. VIDEOS ABOUT GOVERNMENT JOBS ARE GETTING MILLIONS OF VIEWS FROM JOBSEEKERS ON TIKTOK COMING UP. >>> WE'RE BACK AND THE NEW JOBS. >>> WE'RE BACK AND THE NEW JOBS REPORT OUT TODAY SHOWED MORE JOBS WERE ADDED IN FEBRUARY THAN EXPECTED, SHOWING PRETTY GOOD SIGNS OF JOB MARKET. THAT IS STRONG. HOWEVER, THAT GOOD NEWS IS COLLIDING WITH OTHER POTENTIALLY WORRISOME NEWS. LAYOFFS IN FEBRUARY HIT THE HIGHEST LEVEL FOR THAT MONTH SINCE THE FINANCIAL CRISIS IN 2009.. AND NUMBERS LIKE THAT CONCERN ANYBODY LOOKING FOR A JOB. HOWEVER, GEN Z AND YOUNG MILLENNIALS- THEY FOUND A LITTLE HACK. IF YOU WILL TO GIVE THEM SOME JOB SECURITY. NBC'S JULIE TSIRKIN HAS THAT STORY. >>. Reporter, IF YOU ARE ON SOCIAL MEDIA, CHANCES ARE. YOU'VE SEEN HIS VIDEOS ALL OVER YOUR FOR YOU PAGE JOB CUTS. NO MATTER THE INDUSTRY CAN BE FOUND ALL OVER THE HEADLINES. SO TO AVOID BEING JUST ANOTHER ONE OF THE 160,000 LAYOFFS ALONE, GEN Z AND MILLENNIALS FOUND A HACK CALLING IT QUITS ON THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND GOING PUBLIC MANY LOOKING TO LOCKDOWN. GOVERNMENT JOBS FOR SECURITY >>. THINK OF THE BENEFITS YOU ARE NOT GOING TO GET LAID OFF VERSUS THE PRIVATE SECTOR. >>. Reporter. 77% OF THE CLASS OF 2024 SAY THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO APPLY TO A JOB THAT PROMISES STABILITY, AND THAT IS WHAT A GOVERNMENT JOB OFFERS. >>. WE HAVE TO HAVE A GOVERNMENT. IF WE DON'T, OUR SOCIETY IS IN TROUBLE AND OUR DEMOCRACY AS WELL. IT IS NOT THAT YOUR JOBS ARE FOREVER, NECESSARILY BUT CERTAINLY. THE ORGANIZATION IS THERE. >>. Reporter. SALARIED WORKERS IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR HOLD THEIR JOBS FOR THREE MORE YEARS ON AVERAGE THAN IN PRIVATE, AND THE YOUNGER GENERATION IS BEGINNING TO NOTICE GOVERNMENT JOBS. HASHTAG ON TIKTOK HAS 23 MILLION VIEWS. >>. I NEED TO START APPLYING TO JOBS WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. >>. Reporter. FEDERAL JOBS RECEIVED TWICE AS MANY APPLICATIONS. THE PAYCHECK IS PROBABLY SMALLER AND, ON AVERAGE, FEDERAL WORKERS EARNED 22% LESS THAN PRIVATE SECTOR WORKERS WITH SIMILAR ROLES. BUT FOR MANY, THE BENEFITS ARE THE SELLING POINTS: GOOD HEALTH INSURANCE, RETIRING EARLY WITH A PENSION AND, AFTER A DECADE, STUDENT LOANS ARE WIPED CLEAN. FOR MANY A PERK- NEARLY 70% SAY, WILL INFLUENCE THEIR DECISIONS. AND OF COURSE, THERE IS THE WORKLIFE BALANCE. >>. YOU DO YOUR JOB FROM 9:00 UNTIL 5:00 AND ENJOY YOUR LIFE AFTER WORK AND DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO. >>. Reporter. LESS THAN 8% OF FEDERAL WORKERS ARE YOUNGER THAN 30 AND NEARLY HALF ARE OVER 50.. >>. THE CHALLENGE THOUGH THE LEADERS IN GOVERNMENT DON'T PRIORITIZE: CREATING THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE, ENSURING THAT THE MANAGERS KNOW HOW TO MANAGE GEN Z AND MILLENNIAL, AND MAKING SURE THE PROCESS ITSELF IS NOT OVERLY ONEROUS. >>. Reporter. THE LONG PROCESS CAN BE A BIG TURNOFF >>. I TOLD THEM IT WILL TAKE A MINUTE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY A MINUTE? FIVE OR SIX MONTHS: THEY GET VERY DISCOURAGED. YOU JUST HAVE TO BE PATIENT BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU WILL GET A SECURE JOB WHERE YOU WILL NOT GET LAID OFF. >>. ALL RIGHT, LET'S BRING A JULIE TSIRKIN WITH MORE ON THIS. YOU KNOW, GOVERNMENT JOBS ARE KIND OF A HOT BUTTON ISSUE UP THERE ON THE HILL. HOW DOES POLITICS PLAY INTO ALL THIS? >>. Reporter. OF COURSE IT DOES, TOM. THAT IS A HOT BUTTON ISSUE. UNDER PRESIDENT BIDEN, CERTAINLY LOOKING FOR THE GOVERNMENT MIGHT SOUNDED A GOOD IDEA. THE JOBS REPORT THAT CAME OUT TODAY- 52,000 OF THOSE JOBS WERE GOVERNMENT JOBS. THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE MONTHLY AVERAGE WE'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST YEAR. BUT HERE IS THE THING FORMER: PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, WHO WILL LIKELY BE THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE FOR PRESIDENT, FACING OFF AGAINST BIDEN. HE IS PROMISING TO/GOVERNMENT JOBS AND GOVERNMENT SPENDING SOMETHING. YOU SEE REPUBLICANS HAMMERING DEMOCRATS ABOUT. CONSTANTLY, THE SENATE IS PASSING THE FUNDING BILLS, AN AREA IN WHICH REPUBLICANS ARE CONSTANTLY SAYING: LET'S SPEND LESS, SHRINKING THE AMOUNT OF JOBS AND THE GOVERNMENT WORKFORCE IN THAT SPACE. CERTAINLY YOU CAN SEE A CHANGE HAPPEN WHEN IT COMES TO THE NOVEMBER ELECTION. BUT FOR NOW THIS IS AN INDUSTRY. HE IS LOOKING TO JOIN IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR. USE OTHERS VIDEOS ON TIKTOK. THOSE YOUNGER KIDS ARE LOOKING FOR THAT SAFETY AND SECURITY THOSE PUBLIC JOBS OFFER >>. THE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE ON TIKTOK BECAUSE THEY WANT A GOVERNMENT JOB. YET THE GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO SHUT DOWN TIKTOK. HAS ANYBODY CAUGHT THAT PSYCHO? >>. Reporter. THAT'S TRUE. THAT IS A GOOD POINT, TOM. >>. JULIE TSIRKIN, THANK YOU. >>> YOU EVER FIND. THERE IS TOO MUCH NEWS TO KEEP TRACK OF. YOU ARE IN LUCK. OUR TEAMS HAVE BOILED DOWN SOME OF THE HEADLINES FROM THE REGION AND THIS IS WHAT THEY TELL US IS GOING DOWN. WE CALL THIS SEGMENTS. THE LOCAL IN THE NORTHEAST POLICE ARRESTED A FORMER CONVICT TURNED CRIMINAL JUSTICE ADVOCATE. AFTER THEY FOUND A HUMAN TORSO IN A NEW YORK APARTMENT. THE SUSPECT PREVIOUSLY SPENT 25 YEARS IN PRISON FOR ATTEMPTED MURDER AND RECENTLY SPOKE OUT ABOUT TURNING HIS LIFE AROUND. HE IS PLEADING, NOT GUILTY TO MULTIPLE CHARGES, INCLUDING MURDER. >>>. FROM THE NORTHEAST BUREAU, FIREFIGHTERS BATTLED A MASSIVE FIRE IN NEW JERSEY AT WHAT IS BELIEVED TO BE A FORMER CARDBOARD WAREHOUSE. HUGE, SMOKE AND FLAMES THERE, NOBODY INJURED AND THE CASE IS UNDER INVESTIGATION. >>> A FORMER JACKSONVILLE JAGUARS EMPLOYEE USED TEAM MONEY TO MAKE A LIFE OF LUXURY. REMEMBER PATEL PLEADED GUILTY IN DECEMBER TO STEALING $20 MILLION FROM THE TEAM. PROSECUTORS SAY HE SPEND IT ON THINGS LIKE A PUTTER USED BY TIGER WOODS PRIVATE JETS. PATEL'S LAWYERS CLAIM HIS ACTIONS WERE FUELED BY HIS GAMBLING ADDICTION AND HE IS SET TO BE SENTENCED NEXT WEEK. >>>. IN JUST UNDER AN HOUR, THE BIGGEST STAR IN COLLEGE BASKETBALL WILL HIT THE STAGE AGAIN. KATELYN CLARK WILL START IN MINNEAPOLIS WITH HER IOWA HAWKEYES AGAINST PENN STATE AT THE BIG TEN'S WOMEN'S BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT. FOR THE RECORD, WE CHECKED THE TICKET WEBSITES AND THE MEN'S TOURNAMENT HAS THOUSANDS OF UNSOLD TICKETS BUT FOR THE WOMEN'S- SOLD OUT FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER. THE BIG TEN EXPECTED THIS YEAR'S CROWD TO MORE THAN DOUBLE LAST YEAR'S RECORD ATTENDANCE- PRETTY MUCH, ALL OF IT. THANKS TO CLARK, THE SPORTS ALL-TIME LEADING SCORER, MALE OR FEMALE SURPASSING PETE. JUST THIS WEEK SHAQUILLE BREWSTER IS FOLLOWING ALL OF THIS FOR US. ARE YOU GOING TO GET A SEAT TONIGHT? IF YOU ARE IN CHICAGO, YOU ARE NOT IN MINNEAPOLIS. >>. Reporter. I WISH, I WISH. >>. CLARK IS BOOSTING POPULARITY AND TV NUMBERS AS WELL RIGHT. >>. Reporter. THAT IS EXACTLY RIGHT. LOOK THE GAME WE SAW WHERE KATELYN CLARK BROKE THAT SCORING RECORD. THAT WAS A RECORD-SETTING GAME. THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME WE SAW THAT. MANY PEOPLE WATCHING COEGE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL SINCE 1999. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE OTHER SPORTS, IT'S COMPETING WITH. LOOK AT THE SMOKESCREEN. SHE IS IN GOOD COMPANY BECAUSE THE OTHER SPORTS ON THE LIST: HOLIDAY GAMES, IN-STATE TOURNAMENT GAMES, THE MARCH 3rd GAME- 3.39 MILLION VIEWERS. TOM, IT IS NOT JUST TV. THE BIG TEN CONFERENCE QUARTERFINALS IS HAPPENING. TONIGHT I WAS LOOKING AT LOCAL COVERAGE. THERE AGAIN, I AM NOT IN MINNEAPOLIS. I WISH I WAS GIVEN A TICKET, BUT I AM NOT THAT LUCKY. A LOCAL REPORTER SAID THERE WERE FANS LINING UP OUTSIDE AND INSIDE THE STADIUM FROM EARLIER THAN 6:00 AM TODAY AND TIPOFF IS 5:30 PM TONIGHT. SO A LOT OF EXCITEMENT THERE IN MINNEAPOLIS AS PEOPLE ARE EXCITED FOR THIS GAME >>. I WON'T EVEN DO THAT FOR THE ROLLING STONES AND I LOVE THE ROLLING STONES. THERE IS THIS SAYING A BASKETBALL THAT IT IS A TEAM SPORT. WE KNOW CLARK REACHED THE TITLE LAST YEAR, BUT LOST COULD HER SUCCESS ALONE LIFT IOWA TO A CHAMPIONSHIP >>. Reporter LOOKING AT WHAT WE SAW LAST YEAR. THE ANSWER IS N IOWA, LOST TO LSU, DESPITE THE CAITLIN CLARK GETTING 30, 31 POINTS IN THAT GAME. LET'S LOOK AT WHAT OUR RIENDS AT FANDUEL ARE SAYING RIGHT NOW ABOUT THIS OVERALL NCAA WOMEN'S TOURNAMENT. YOU CAN SEE THE SOUTH CAROLINA GAMECOCKS. THEY ARE THE FAVORITE TO WIN THE TITLE THERE BUT LSU AND IOWA ARE NOT TOO BUT LSU AND IOWA ARE NOT TOO FAR BEHIND THEM LOOK. ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN THIS GAME THAT WE WILL SEE IOWA AND CAITLIN CLARK PLAY TONIGHT BECAUSE WE ARE IN THAT SINGLE ELIMINATION SERIES OR TIMING OF THIS TOURNAMENT. IT COULD POTENTIALLY BE CAITLIN CLARK 'S FINAL COLLEGE BASKETBALL GAME. WE KNOW SHE SAID SHE WOULD ENTER THE WNBA OR AT LEAST ENTER THE DRAFT. WE WILL BE SHOCKED IF SHE DOESN'T MAKE IT INTO THE LEAGUE, BUT IT COULD POTENTIALLY BE HER FINAL GAME IF SHE DOES LOSE. >>> BACK NOW WITH TONIGHT'S. >>> BACK NOW WITH TONIGHT'S ORIGINAL, WITH IN-DEPTH REPORTING ON TOPICS WE KEEP AN EYE ON HERE. TONIGHT IT IS THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN GAZA GROWING WORSE BY THE HOUR. THE PORT PRESIDENT BIDEN ANNOUNCED LAST NIGHT: WE ARE JUST LEARNING IT COULD TAKE 60 DAYS BEFORE IT IS FULLY OPERATIONAL. THAT ACCORDING TO TWO SENIOR US OFFICIALS. THE US WAS HOPING THE FLOATING DOCK COULD HELP WITH FOOD AND SUPPLIES ARRIVING FROM THE MEDITERRANEAN, ARRIVING DIRECTLY IN GAZA IN THE MEANTIME. THE SITUATION FOR CIVILIANS GROWING MORE DIRE BY CIVILIANS GROWING MORE DIRE BY THE DAY, BY THE HOUR. MANY CHILDREN NOW YOUNGER THAN THE WAR ITSELF. NBC'S MEAGAN FITZGERALD HAS MORE >>. Reporter. AGONY AND DEVASTATION GRIPPING GAZA IS DEEPENING, BUT IT IS THE MOST VULNERABLE. WE ARE PAYING THE HEAVIEST PRICE: THE INNOCENCE OF CHILDREN STRIPPED AWAY AS THOUSANDS BECOME CASUALTIES OF THIS WAR. THOSE WHO HAVE SURVIVED SO FAR ARE LEFT WITH IMMEASURABLE TRAUMA, TRAUMA >>. FOR OVER 100 YEARS WE WORKED ON ALL OF THE CRISES IN THE WORLD AND THIS IS THE WORST SITUATION, ESPECIALLY FOR CHILDREN >>. Reporter. A SITUATION, SO DIRE. CHILDREN ARE FORCED TO EAT ANIMAL FEED, GROUND UP INTO PATTIES, CAGES FOR ANIMALS TURNED INTO BEDS FOR CHILDREN, TRAPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF UNSPEAKABLE HORRORS. AS THE UN WARNS, GAZA IS ON THE BRINK OF FAMINE. THE GAZA HEALTH MINISTRY SAYS AT LEAST 20 PEOPLE HAVE DIED- OVER A DOZEN OF THEM CHILDREN- IN OVER A WEEK, FROM DEHYDRATION AND STARVATION. FOR THE KIDS, LUCKY ENOUGH TO ESCAPE. LIKE THIS WOMAN AND HER FIVE KIDS. LIFE GOES ON. WE FIRST MET THE FAMILY IN CAIRO JUST HOURS AFTER THEY ESCAPED GAZA, WHEN AMERICANS WERE ALLOWED TO LEAVE. >> HOW HAS IT BEEN SINCE YOU CAME BACK TO THE UNITED KINGDOM? >> SURREAL, IT IS DIFFICULT TO ADJUST TO NORMAL LIFE. WE ARE JUST STRUGGLING TO GET BACK TO SOME TYPE OF NORMALCY. I WOULD SAY ALL OF THE FAMILY WE LEFT BEHIND IS CONSTANTLY HARD >>. Reporter. SURVIVOR'S GUILT HAUNTS HER FAMILY, ESPECIALLY HER 10-YEAR-OLD TWIN BOYS. >> YOU MENTIONED YOU DIDN'T WANT TO GO TO THE PARK. WHY NOT? >> BECAUSE I FEEL BAD FOR MY FAMILY IN GAZA, BECAUSE IF THEY TRIED TO GO OUTSIDE, THEY COULD TRIED TO GO OUTSIDE, THEY COULD BE HURT AND STUFF, AND I FEEL THAT. >>. Reporter. THEIR OLDER COUSIN WAS THEIR BEST FRIEND. THE FAMILY SAYS HE DIED IN AN ISRAELI DRONE STRIKE THE DAY AFTER CHRISTMAS, WHILE WALKING ON A STREET IN GAZA. IT WAS HIS 13th BIRTHDAY >>. IT RIPS YOUR HEART OUT. THEY SHOULD BE KIDS AND THEY SHOULD PLAY. >>. Reporter. MORE THAN 1 MILLION CHILDREN IN GAZA NEED MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT, BUT WITH ALMOST NO ACCESS TO SPECIALIST DOCTORS. MAKESHIFT TRAUMA TENDS -- TENTS ALLOW KIDS TO BE KIDS. IF EVEN FOR A MOMENT, THE CHRONIC EXPOSURE TO VIOLENCE MAY BE ON THE SEAS OF AGGRESSION. SAYING. THE PARENTS OF THESE KIDS SAY THEY ARE SCARED BECAUSE THEY SEE WHAT IT IS LIKE FOR THEM, THAT THERE ARE FEWER ALTERNATIVES TO ARMED RESISTANCE AND IT'S DIFFICULT TO KEEP THE KIDS AWAY FROM THAT PATH, BECAUSE SO MANY HOPES HAVE BEEN DESTROYED. TRAUMA PSYCHOLOGISTS HAVE TURNED THIS INTO A TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER >>. I WANT TO REVENGE BEFORE MY PARENTS. I AM WRITING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT HASN'T BEEN DISCUSSED OR SPOKEN ABOUT: THE SUICIDE PALESTINIAN KIDS WERE COMMITTING BEFORE 2023.. WHY? IT IS BECAUSE THEY HAVE STRIPPED EVERYTHING GOOD OUT OF LIFE. >>. Reporter FOR EMILY'S OLDEST DAUGHTER, NORA, FOR HER HEALING IS LIVING HER LIFE AS THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN WILL NEVER GET THE CHANCE. >>. I DO MY BEST AND I WORK MY HARDEST FOR THEM. I AM NOT GOING TO WASTE THE OPPORTUNITY THAT I HAVE. I'VE GOT MY EDUCATION >>. Reporter UNICEF SAYS THERE ARE 17,000 KIDS IN GAZA THAT HAVE LOST ONE OR BOTH OF THEIR PARENTS OR HAVE BEEN SEPARATED FROM THEM. THESE KIDS ARE NOW ORPHANS, AND THE CONCERN HERE. THAT NUMBER WILL ONLY GROW AS THE WAR RAGES ON. >>>. THAT IS A WRAP FOR THIS HOUR, BUT THE NEWS CONTINUES RIGHT BUT THE NEWS CONTINUES RIGHT NOW. >>>. WE NEVER QUIT AND WE ARE BACK AT THE TOP OF THE HOUR. WE ARE KICKING IT OFF WITH THE FIERY PRESIDENT BIDEN TAKING HIS VISION FOR THE STATE OF OUR UNION ON THE ROAD RIGHT NOW. HE IS SPEAKING AT A KEY BATTLEGROUND STATE AND WE ARE AT THE WHITE HOUSE WITH WHAT HIS SUPPORTERS ARE SAYING ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE LAST NIGHT AND WHAT THEY EXPECT GOING FORWARD. >>> THE BACKLASH AGAINST TIKTOK. CONGRESS CURING UP FOR A VETO. CONGRESS CURING UP FOR A VETO -- VOTE RATHER TO BEND. THAT IS UNLESS. IT CUTS TIES WITH ITS CHINESE PARENT COMPANY, HOW USERS ARE FIGHTING BACK, TRYING TO SAVE TIKTOK AT HOME. >>> TORNADO WATCH ACROSS THE SOUTH. MILLIONS ARE FACING DANGEROUS WEATHER AND WE WILL SHOW YOU WHERE IN A FEW MINUTES. >>>. THE PENTAGON IS GIVING THE THUMBS UP FOR THE HELICOPTER INVOLVED IN A SERIES OF DEADLY CRASHES.

HOW CAITLIN CLARK IS FEELING A NEW GENERATION OF FANS COMING UP LATER IN THE SHOW. >>> I'M TOM COSTELLO IN FOR HALLIE JACKSON. >>> HITTING THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL LESS THAN 24 HOURS AFTER A SPEECH THAT MANY THINK MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE POLITICAL LIFE REP THAT HE NEEDED. YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE PRESIDENT TALKING OUTSIDE OF HIS ADOPTED HOME CITY OF PHILADELPHIA. ALREADY WE ARE HEARING HIM TO THE SAME THINGS FROM HIS FIERY STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS LAST NIGHT, WHERE HE LAID OUT HIS PLAN OF ATTACK AGAINST FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP AND MADE THE CASE THAT HIS AGE 81, IS NOT THE NUMBER TO FOCUS ON RATHER, IT IS FOUR. HE WANTS FOUR MORE YEARS IN THE WHITE HOUSE. THIS TAKES OFF A WEEK OF CAMPAIGNING FOR HIM AND THE VICE PRESIDENT GOING THROUGH ALL OF THE CRITICAL THAT THEY NEED TO WIN IN NOVEMBER. HERE THEY ARE: WE HAVE GOT ARIZONA, NEVADA, WISCONSIN, MICHIGAN, NEW HAMPSHIRE AND PENNSYLVANIA. AS YOU SEE, WE ARE TOLD TO EXPECT THE SAME THING, EXPERIENCE THAT YOU ONLY GET WITH AGE GOING AFTER MR TRUMP AND REPUBLICANS FOR THE JANUARY 6th INSURRECTION, AND WHAT HE SAYS IS IN ACTION, IN CONGRESS, ON MULTIPLE LEVELS, SHARPENING HIS MESSAGE ON REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS AS WELL, AND TALKING UP WHAT HE SAYS IS AMERICA'S ECONOMIC COMEBACK. HE WILL LIKELY BE WRITING A WAVE OF GOOD JOBS NUMBERS OUT TODAY AND BEATING EXPECTATIONS. WE WILL TALK MORE ABOUT THE NEW STATS IN A MOMENT. THERE THEY ARE, THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS STILL NEAR A LOW. THEY ARE REACTING MOSTLY POSITIVELY, WITH NEARLY TWO THIRDS SAYING THEY HAD A POSITIVE REACTION. MONICA SPOKE WITH REPORTERS IN PHILADELPHIA WHO ARE THRILLED. THEY SAY, WITH THE SPEECH: >> I WAS SO HAPPY. >>. IT WAS AWESOME AND POWERFUL. HE GOT HIS POINT ACROSS >>. HE SITS, STRONG AND LOOKS LIKE A PRESIDENT. THAT IS WILL BE NEEDED >>. THOSE WERE DEMOCRATS- REPUBLICANS- PROBABLY HAVE A DIFFERENT GROUP. SO FAR, WE ARE HEARING HIM USE A LOT OF THE SAME LINES THAT HE USED ON JANUARY 6th: REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS. TALK US THROUGH WHAT YOU ARE HEARING >>. THE PRESIDENT IS STARTING TO SPEAK TO THE VERY FRIENDLY, CROWD AND SUBURBAN PHILADELPHIA, AFTER A VERY ENTHUSIASTIC INTRODUCTION BY FIRST LADY, DR JILL BIDEN, WHERE SHE DELIVERED HER SHARPEST CRITICISM, YET IN REGARDS TO FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP AND WHAT HE DID DURING HIS FIRST TERM IN OFFICE. THE PRESIDENT, AFTER THAT INTRODUCTION, IMMEDIATELY DID NOT WASTE ANY TIME GOING AFTER HIS PREDECESSOR. HE SAYS THAT FREEDOMS ARE GOING TO BE ON THE BALLOT IN 2024.. HE IMMEDIATELY TALKED ABOUT JANUARY 6th AND THE FORMER PRESIDENT'S ROLE ON THAT DAY. THEN HE STARTED TALKING ABOUT HIS GUESTS AT THE STATE OF THE UNION LAST NIGHT, DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE FALLOUT OF THE REVERSAL OF ROE V WADE ON FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS THREE SUPREME COURT WHILE IN OFFICE. TAKE A LOOK AT HIS COMMENTS. >>. PENNSYLVANIA, I HAVE A MESSAGE FOR YOU. SEND ME THE CONGRESS THAT CAN SUPPORT THIS. RIGHT. I PROMISE YOU THAT WE TAKE BACK CONGRESS AND RESTORE ROE V WADE AS THE LAW OF THE LAND. >>. THE TEAM SAYS THAT THIS IS MUCH OF WHAT WE CAN EXPECT, MOVING FORWARD AS THE PRESIDENT TRIES TO CONTINUE THIS MOMENTUM AND STARTED AFTER HIS STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS LAST NIGHT. AS HE SAID, HE IS TRYING TO SPEND ARGUMENTS ABOUT AGE, MENTAL FITNESS AND HIS ABILITY TO WORK THE CROSS AND GET LEGISLATION PASSED ALSO TO SAVE AMERICANS MONEY AND SPREAD THAT ECONOMIC MESSAGE. THE TEAM SAYS THAT THIS IS MUCH OF WHAT WE CAN EXPECT TO SEE FROM THE PRESIDENT AS THE GENERAL ELECTION CAMPAIGN KICKS INTO HIGH GEAR >> WHEN THE CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN PRAISING THE FUNDRAISING THIS WEEKEND, PARTICULARLY SINCE NIKKI HALEY DROPPED OUT OF THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY. WHAT IS THE LATEST NOW ON HOW THIS HAS ALL GONE AND HOW THE FUNDRAISING HAS GONE SINCE LAST MAY. >>. THE TEAM IS VERY PLEASED WITH HOW THEY ADDRESS LAST NIGHT THE HOURS DURING THE STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS FOR THE BEST FUNDRAISING HOURS SINCE THE CAMPAIGN WAS LAUNCHED LAST APRIL, SITTING HISTORIC RECORDS, AND THEY ALSO ANNOUNCED TODAY THAT THEY WILL BE LAUNCHING A NEW SIX WEEKLONG $30 MILLION CAMPAIGN AD IN BATTLEGROUND STATES AND, AS YOU MENTIONED AT THE TOP, THIS TRAVEL BY THE PRESIDENT, VICE PRESIDENT, AS WELL AS THE ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS OVER THE NEXT COMING WEEKS >>. HAS THE MESSAGE SUNK IN THAT HE NEEDS TO BE AS ROBUST, ENERGETIC AND PASSIONATE AND ANGRY OR WHATEVER? >>. THE MESSAGE HAS DEFINITELY SUNK IN AMONG WRITING AND THE QUESTION IS WHETHER VOTERS WILL ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND THAT AND REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN HOW THEY WILL TURN OUT, BECAUSE THE GENERAL ELECTION WILL BE A GAME OF TURNOUT, AND HOW THE BIDEN TEAM CAN GALVANIZE VOTERS AND GET THEM EXCITED AND ENTHUSIASTIC AND A TO GO OUT AND VOTE. SO THE PRESIDENT COULD BE AS ENTHUSIASTIC AS HE WANTS. WHETHER THEY ACCEPT AND ACT ON IT IS A BIG QUESTION. >>. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >>>. TONIGHT, FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP IS EXPECTED TO SIT DOWN WITH THE PRIME MINISTER OF HUNGARY, A MEETING AT THE SCENE, THE TWO MEN MOST ASSOCIATED WITH CONSERVATISM- EXTREME VERSION OF IT- ON THEIR RESPECTIVE CONTINENTS. THE HUNGARIAN PM IS A LONG TIME ALLY OF FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP AND AN ALLY IN NATO. MR TRUMP BASHES AND CONTINUES TO BASH THROUGHOUT HIS CAMPAIGN OFTEN COMPARED TO MR TRUMP. AMONG OTHER REASONS HIS ANTI-IMMIGRANT STATEMENTS AND POLICIES. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DON'T USUALLY FROM FOREIGN LEADERS AND IS WIDELY ACCUSED OF BEING AN AUTHORITARIAN. WHAT WOULD TRUMP BE SITTING DOWN WITH HIM NOW. >>. DONALD TRUMP VIEWS HIM AS NOT ONLY A FORMER ALLY BUT WHEN YOU'RE DOMESTICALLY, I CAN TELL YOU FROM CONVERSATIONS ON THE GROUND YOU HEAR FOLKS TALK ABOUT HIM, BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP BRINGS HIM UP QUITE OFTEN ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL, ATTESTING THAT IN MANY WAYS, LEADERS AROUND THE COUNTRY NEED TO EMULATE THE HUNGARIAN LEADER. IF YOU JUST LOOK AT SOME OF THE COMPARISONS BETWEEN THE TWO COME IN. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE COMMENTS ON IMMIGRATION, FOR EXAMPLE, DONALD TRUMP SUGGESTING THAT IMMIGRANTS POISON THE BLOOD OF THE COUNTRY. SUGGESTING QUOTE: WE DO NOT WANT TO MET BECOME IN A MIXED RACE. ON NATO, DONALD TRUMP SUGGESTED THAT RUSSIA CAN DO WHATEVER THEY WANT AND PAY MORE TOWARDS THEIR NATIONAL DEFENSE OF COURSE. IN THE LAST MONTH, THE FINAL COUNTRY TO APPROVE SWEDEN BEING A MEMBER OF NATO. THEN, WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING AT DEMOCRACY, DONALD TRUMP REPEATEDLY MAKING HIS ELECTION DENIAL, CLAIMS IN COMPARED TO WHO HAS BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT AND IS SERVING A FOURTH TERM IN OFFICE. HAVING VIKTOR ORBAN COME TO FLORIDA IS VERY TELLING. HE WAS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE IN JANUARY WHEN DONALD TRUMP SAID FROM THE STATES THAT VIKTOR ORBAN WAS A GREAT AND STRONG LEADER AND MAKING THE CASE. THAT IS WHY A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T LIKE HIM. DONALD TRUMP WENT ON TO SAY- QUOTE: IT'S NICE TO HAVE A STRONG MAN RUNNING YOUR COUNTRY. DEMOCRATS HAVE EXPRESSED FEAR, AND DONALD TRUMP INTENDS TO BE A STRONG MAN IN MUCH OF THE WAY THATHAS SEEN OVER LIBERAL DEMOCRACY AND HAVING A LEADER IN THE US TO TRY TO EMULATE HIM >>. IT IS PRETTY MUCH A ONE PARTY STATE RIGHT NOW, AND HE ALSO CONTROLS THE MEDIA. BY THE WAY, JUST YESTERDAY SWEDEN OFFICIALLY JOINED NATO AFTER AND HUNGARY LIFTED UP LOCK. IF MR TRUMP IS RE-ELECTED, THERE IS TALK THAT HE AND VIKTOR ORBAN COULD UNDERMINE NATO. THIS IS THE RUSSIAN THREAT IS MORE SERIOUS >>. YOU HEARD IN THE STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS CONCERNS ABOUT THE STATE OF DEMOCRACY BUT ALSO THE ROLE THAT THE WEST PLEASE OVERSEAS AS PART OF THE NATO ALLIANCE. SWEDEN IS NOW THE 32nd MEMBER OF NATO, BUT IT IS HUNGARY WHO IS THE FINAL COUNTRY HOLDING UP APPROVAL OF SWEDEN TO BECOME PART OF NATO. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE EU AND INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT FOR AID TO UKRAINE AND THEIR EFFORTS TO DEFEND THE COUNTRY FROM RUSSIA, IT WAS JUST IN THE LAST MONTH THAT FINALLY, UNDER PRESSURE THAT VIKTOR ORBAN AND HUNGARY, WAS THE FINAL EU COUNTRY TO SIGN OFF ON $50 BILLION IN AID. SIGN OFF ON $50 BILLION IN AID GOING FROM YOU TO UKRAINE. OF COURSE, DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF EXPRESSING CONCERN OR HESITANCY FROM THE US AND CONTINUING TO PROVIDE AID. SO, DONALD TRUMP USED VIKTOR ORBAN- IF YOU WERE TO GET BACK TO THE WHITE HOUSE AS A LEADER ON THAT FRONT >>. VIKTOR ORBAN WAS VERY CLOSE TO VLADIMIR PUTIN. THANK YOU >>>. NEXT WEEK, THE HOUSE IS SET TO VOTE ON A BILL THAT COULD GET TIKTOK BAND IN THE UNITED STATES. THAT HAS A LOT OF USERS OF THE APP VERY UPSET. IT IS A BIPARTISAN BILL AIMING TO GET THE PARENT COMPANY TO SELL THE APP OR MAKE IT UNAVAILABLE IN THE UNITED STATES. REMEMBER THEY ARE BASED OUT OF BEIJING UNDER TRUE CONCERN FOR LAWMAKERS IN THE UNITED STATES, AND CRITICS ARE PROTECTING US DATA FROM THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT. IT IS A PRIVATE COMPANY AND NOT OWNED OR CONTROLLED BY THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT. THEY GOT SUPPORT OF THE HOUSE SPEAKER AND JUST ADVANCED OUT OF THE HOUSE ENERGY AND CONGRESS COMMITTEE WITH A 15-0 VOTE. TIKTOK IS TRYING TO FIGHT BACK, SENDING OUT THIS NOTIFICATION TO USERS WHO ARE 18 AND OLDER, ASKING THEM TO CALL THEIR REPRESENTATIVES TO TELL THEM TO VOTE NO ON THE BILL. THAT SEEMS TO BE WORKING. WE ARE HEARING FROM LAWMAKERS WHO TELL OUR TEAM THAT THEIR OFFICES HAVE BEEN FLOODED WITH PHONE CALLS FROM ANGRY CONSTITUENTS. NBC'S BRIAN CHEUNG JOINS ME TO THROUGH THE BILL AND THE KIND OF IMPACT THAT IT COULD HAVE. TO UNDERSCORE THIS: IF YOU ARE A TEENAGER OR TWENTYSOMETHING, THEN YOU LOVE TIKTOK >>. THAT IS WHY SO MANY OF THESE CONGRESSIONAL OFFICES ARE GETTING FLOODED WITH CALLS. LET'S UNPACK EXACTLY WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED. THIS BILL PASSED THE HOUSE OF COMMONS COMMITTEE YESTERDAY, THE FOURTH HOLDING COMPANY, WHICH IS THE COMPANY KNOWN AS ISRAELI, TO SELL TIKTOK WITHIN 180 DAYS OF THE ENACTMENT. IT ALSO OFFERS A PROCESS FOR THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH AND IT IS THE FIRST PRONG THAT WOULD BE USED IN THIS LAW TO ENFORCE ISRAELI TO SELL THE COMPANY. IF THEY DON'T DO THAT IN SIX MONTHS, THE BEEN GOOD BE NATIONWIDE. THE BIPARTISAN BILL WOULD SUGGEST BANDS FROM THE COMMITTEE, AND ONCE IT DOES FACE A VOTE WHICH THE HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER SAYS WILL COME SOMETIME NEXT WEEK, THEN THEY COULD FACE PAUL -- FULL PASSAGE. TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE IN REGARDS TO MOMENTUM >>. IT IS IMPRESSIVE IN NATURE BUT PARTICULARLY AS IT RELATES TO SOMETHING IN THE SOCIAL MEDIA SPACE WHICH HAS NOT ALWAYS BEEN EASY PREY FOR DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS TO FIND COMMON GROUND >>. THAT WAS MINORITY LEADER TALKING ABOUT 50 -0 VOTE OF THE COMMITTEE. IT JUST SHOWS THAT THEY ARE ALL APPEARING ON THE SAME SIDE. ON THIS FRONT >> WE WENT AND THE CAMPAIGN THAT TIKTOK IS UNDERWAY TO GET USERS ON ITS SIDE. THEY ARE RUNNING TV COMMERCIALS SHOWING NUNS USING TIKTOK. WHAT ELSE IS BYTEDANCE SAYING? >> THE FULL BLITZ FROM THE COMPANY TRYING TO GET THEIR USERS TO CALL THEIR CONGRESSPERSON AND SAY: BUT THIS DONE IN A STATEMENT. TIKTOK DID SEE THE FOLLOWING. THEY HAVE A PREDETERMINED OUTCOME AND A TOTAL BAN AFTER TALK. TIKTOK WILL DESTROY PEOPLE AND THEIR LIVELIHOODS. SOME PEOPLE BUILD A WHOLE LIVELIHOOD OUT OF SELLING TRINKETS THAT THEY REALLY PROMOTE THROUGH THEIR THOUSANDS OF FOLLOWERS ON TIKTOK. TIKTOK IS TRYING TO LEAD INTO THOSE TYPES OF USERS, TO TRY THE POLITICAL RHETORIC TO SHOOT DOWN THIS TYPE OF LEGISLATION AND WHETHER OR NOT IT IS SUCCESSFUL, IS A BIPARTISAN PUSH. IF IT PASSES THE HOUSE AND GETS TO THE SENATE. WE HAVE HEARD THAT THE WHITE HOUSE SEEMS TO BE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BECAUSE. WE HEARD THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL SAY THAT THEY THINK IT IS A GOOD STEP >>. THAT REALLY, IS AN AMAZING DEVELOPMENT. SOME OF THESE TIKTOK USERS GO ON TO GET TV AND MOVIE RULES. THIS HAS TAKEN ON A LIFE OF ITS OWN, THANK YOU. >>>. TO THE SKY AS WE GO RIGHT NOW, A TORNADO WATCH IN EFFECT FOR PARTS OF THE SOUTH AS THEY BRACED FOR WHAT COULD BE A DANGEROUS EVENING WITH SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS MOVING ACROSS THE REGION. 6 MILLION PEOPLE ARE AT RISK FROM INTENSE STORM. LOOK AT THAT. IT IS STRETCHING ALL THE WAY FROM TEXAS TO GEORGIA. ON TOP OF THAT, 14 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE SAME AREA UNDER FLOOD WATCHES. NBC NEWS'S BILL KARINS IS WATCHING ALL OF THIS. IT HAS BEEN AN HOUR SINCE WE TALKED. GIVE US THE LATEST. >>. ONE HOUR AGO, WE HAD A TORNADO WARNING IN EFFECT AND IT WAS RADAR INDICATED AND HAS SINCE FALLEN APART. THEY MAY HAVE NEVER BEEN ON THE GROUND, WHICH IS GREAT. WE HAVE OUR TORNADO WATCH AND TORNADOES ARE POSSIBLE. SO, AND 10:00 THIS EVENING, WE HAVE SEVEN MISSISSIPPI, IN ALABAMA, WITH FLASH FLOODING. THAT IS BY FAR THE BIGGEST LIFE THREATENING RISK. WITH THE NEW FLASH FLOOD WARNING. WE HAVE A THUNDERSTORM WARNING AND NOW THEY ARE UNDER FLASH FLOOD WARNINGS AND IT HAS ALL OF ALABAMA AND SOUTH GEORGIA. SOUTH CAROLINA HAS SPOTS IN THE FLASH FLOOD WATCH, ADDITIONALLY EASY TO THREE INCHES, AND SOME OF IT IS DONE. TOMORROW MORNING AND COULD GET UP TO ONE HALF FOOT OF RAIN. TOMORROW WAS SHOT IN THE MID- ATLANTIC AND SEVERE STORM AS POSSIBLE IN THE SOUTHEAST. LATELY. THAT RAIN AND SNOW IS PUSHING TO THE NORTHEAST IS THE SEVERE RISK. SAVANNAH, CHARLESTON, MYRTLE BEACH, LYMINGTON AND GEORGIA PUT A FLASH FLOOD WATCH FOR PHILADELPHIA OUTSIDE OF NEW YORK CITY IN THE SUBURBS, THEN FROM THERE TO NEW HAMPSHIRE AND INTO SOUTHERN MASSACHUSETTS. WE GET A LOT OF RAIN INTO SATURDAY EVENING AND OVERNIGHT HOURS AT ABOUT 1 TO 1.5 INCHES AND AT THE HIGHEST OF ELEVATION IT WILL SNOW TOMORROW EVENING AND THE PLOWABLE PRETTY CAN ALMOST DRAW THE MOUNTAINS. THESE ARE THE WHITE MOUNTAINS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND GOING DOWN TO THE SPINE OF VERMONT AND UPSTATE, NEW YORK. THEN A LITTLE UPSTATE, NEW YORK. THEN A LITTLE BIT IN THE CASTLE HILLS. THEY WERE THINKING THAT SKI SEASON WAS GOING TO AN EARLY BUT THIS MAY EXTEND IT >>. YOU KNOW WHAT ALWAYS AMAZES ME: THERE IS NEVER ANY WEATHER IN CANADA. IT IS BEAUTIFUL UP THERE WITH NO PROBLEM, IT IS ONLY DOWN HERE. >>. MY CANADIAN FRIENDS ALWAYS ROLLED THEIR EYES AT OUR WEATHER MAP >>. I HAVE ARGUED FOR THEM, BUT I GET OUT ROLLED. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >>>. IN THE MICHIGAN COURTROOM, THE PROSECUTION ZEROING IN ON WHAT THE FATHER OF A MASS SCHOOL SHOOTER DID NOT TELL DETECTIVES WHEN HE SAT DOWN WITH DETECTIVES TO HELP PIECE TOGETHER. WHAT HAPPENED THAT DAY? TAKE A LISTEN. >> WHAT THEY DIDN'T TELL YOU. HE NEVER TOLD YOU THAT HE BOUGHT THE MURDER WEAPON FOUR DAYS AGO >> HE DID NOT. >> HE DIDN'T SAY THAT HE BOUGHT IT FOR HIS SON >> HE DID NOT. >> HE DN'T TELL YOU THAT THE GUN WAS LOCKED UP >> HE DID NOT. >> PICTURES SENT HOME THAT DAY HE WAS DOODLING ON PAPER >> CORRECT. >> THAT MAN RIGHT. THERE IS JAMES CRUMBLEY IN COURT TODAY AND D4 OF A RARE CASE WHEN THE PARENT OF A MASS SCHOOL SHOOTER IS ON TRIAL FOR THEIR CHILD'S ACTIONS. HIS SON OPENED FIRE AT OXFORD HIGH SCHOOL IN NOVEMBER 2021, KILLING FOUR STUDENTS. AS YOU KNOW, THEIR FAMILIES AND FRIENDS MISS THEM. TERRIBLY, JAMES CRUMBLEY IS FACING CHARGES OF INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER AGAINST AND ONE FOR EACH OF THOSE FOR STUDENTS. A JURY CONVICTED HIS WIFE ALREADY, WHO IS ON THE SAME CHARGES. WHAT ELSE DID YOU HEAR TODAY? THAT STOOD OUT TO YOU IN COURT? >>. WE HEARD FROM SEVERAL WITNESSES, INCLUDING THE MANAGER OF A LOCAL GUN STORE, WHERE AUTHORITIES SAY THAT JAMES COMPLETE HAS TO BACK TO THIS. THEY SAY THAT IT WOULD BECOME THE MURDER WEAPON AND GOING SHOPPING AT THE GUN STORE WITH HIS SON AND BRINGING EVEN IN THERE WITH HIM ABOUT THE CABLE THAT CAME WITH THE GUN, WHICH AUTHORITIES SAY THAT CRUMBLEY DIDN'T USED TO SECURE IT, ALLOWING HIS SON TO GET A HOLD OF IT AND BRING IT TO SCHOOL THAT DAY. ONE THING THAT STOOD OUT TO US IS A LOT OF CROSS-EXAMINATION AND PUSHING BACK FOR THE FIRST TIME FROM THE DEFENSE. THIS IS DAY TWO OF TESTIMONY, SO IT'S A FIRST FOR THEM. IN EXCHANGE. THAT REALLY STUCK OUT WAS A COMPUTER CRIMES ANALYST WHO TESTIFIED ABOUT DIFFERENT TEXT MESSAGES THAT ETHAN HAD SENT A CLOSE FRIEND OF HIS. IN ONE CASE THEY TESTIFIED THAT ETHAN TEXTED HIS FRIEND AND ASKED PARENTS TO GET HELP FOR HIS MENTAL HEALTH BUT HIS FATHER TOLD HIM TO TAKE PILLS"". SUCK IT UP. HERE IS HOW JAMES CRUMBLEY'S DEFENSE ATTORNEY TRIED TO POKE HOLES IN THAT TESTIMONY. >>. IN APRIL OF 2021, YOU TESTIFIED ABOUT MR CRUMBLEY'S SON TELLING HIS FRIEND: I WILL ASK MY PARENTS TO GO TO THE BATHROOM WRITE. >>. HE WAS TALKING ABOUT HEARING VOICES AND STUFF LIKE THAT >>. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT WAS. IN REVIEWING THE EXHIBIT WE HAVE, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT, DOCTOR, HE WAS ASKING TO SEE >>, FROM THE WORDS PRIOR TO THAT- WHERE HE IS HEARING VOICES AND FEELS LIKE HE IS DYING INSIDE. I DO NOT KNOW >>. THERE ARE A LOT OF EXCHANGES LIKE THAT TODAY. ANOTHER NOTE, AND WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS PROPERTY: THE 47-YEAR-OLD FATHER THAT DEFENDED HIM IN THIS CASE IS FINDING HIMSELF IN LEGAL HOT WATER OF A DIFFERENT KIND. AFTER. THE JUDGE AT THE END OF THE DAY YESTERDAY GRANTED THE PROSECUTION'S REQUEST TO BASICALLY RESTRICT JAMES CRUMBLEY'S COMMUNICATION FROM INSIDE DEAL, BASICALLY SAYING THAT HE CANNOT ONLY COMMUNICATE WITH HIS LAWYER AND WITH THE COURT CALLS LEGITIMATE CLERGY- ALL OF THIS STEMS ACCORDING TO THE LOCAL SHERIFF'S OFFICE- FROM THREATS THAT JAMES CRUMBLEY MADE VIA PHONE AND WHAT THEY CALL ELECTRONIC MESSAGES. HE WOULDN'T SAY WHO OR WHEN THAT HAPPENED BUT BASICALLY, AS A RESULT, JAMES CRUMBLEY IS LARGELY CLOSED OFF TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE TRIAL. >>. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR STAYING ON TOP OF IT >>>. THE US MILITARY SAYS TONIGHT THAT ONE OF THE MOST TROUBLE AIRCRAFT ARE AGAIN CLEARED FOR TAKEOFF. IT COMES MONTHS AFTER, EIGHT AIRMEN WERE KILLED WHEN A 22 HELICOPTER CRASHED OFF THE COAST OF JAPAN. IT MARKED THE FOURTH FIDDLED CRASH JUST OVER A TWO-YEAR PERIOD, KILLING A TOTAL OF 20 SERVICEMEMBERS. THEY SAY THAT THE LATEST CRASH HAVE SOME TO DO WITH THE GEARBOX, BUT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT IS STILL NOT SURE WHY A PART FAILED. DESPITE THAT THE MILITARY SAYS THAT THE MARINES NAVY AND AIR FORCE WILL RESUME FLYING THE OSPREY OVER THE COMING MONTHS. COURTNEY QB HAS BEEN BREAKING DOWN THE INVESTIGATION, COURTNEY, WHAT KIND OF APPROACH IS THE MILITARY TAKING GOING FORWARD TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE HELICOPTER, PLANES, VEHICLES, SAVED, APPLY >>. ABSOLUTELY UNIQUE. THE MILITARY HAS NOT COMPLETED THE INVESTIGATION INTO THE MOST RECENT CRASH. THE MILITARY GROUNDED ALL ACROSS FOR ABOUT THREE MONTHS. THEY HAVE DETERMINED, WITH THE MATERIAL FAILURE WAS SO BASICALLY WHAT THE PART WAS THAT FAILED CAUSING THAT FATAL CRASH BUT, ACCORDING TO A NUMBER OF MILITARY OFFICIALS, THEY HAVE NOT DETERMINED WITH FULL CERTAINTY WHAT CAUSED IT TO CRASH. THE MILITARY IS NOT EVEN SAYING THAT PART. YET NBC NEWS HAS BEEN REPORTING THAT FOR A NUMBER OF WEEKS, THE SERVICES HAVE IMPLEMENTED A NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL PROCEDURES- THAT IS BEFORE THE AIRCRAFT GOES UP AND THE MECHANICS ON THE GROUND- WITH ADDITIONAL CHECKS TO MAKE SURE THE AIRCRAFT IS SAVED. APPLY IN ADDITION TO THAT THEY WILL RE-TRAIN THE TRAINER AND GO THROUGH SOME OF THE TO GET THEM REQUALIFIED OR READY AGAIN TO GO BACK IN THE AIR. THE OVERALL PROCESS BEFORE WE SEE THE ENTIRE FLEET BACK UP IN THE AIR WILL PROBABLY TAKE UNTIL SUMMER, FOR THE MILITARY IS CALLING IT A PHASED APPROACH TO GET THEM BACK IN THE AIR. THE REALITY IS THAT THE ARE ACKNOWLEDGING SOME LIMITATIONS ON THE AIRCRAFT GOING FORWARD. THEY ARE NOT IDENTIFYING EXACT WHAT THOSE LIMITATIONS ARE. >> UNDERSTOOD 22 PEOPLE KILLED OVER TWO YEARS. THERE HAVE BEEN PROBLEMS WITH THE OFFSPRING GOING BACK 20 YEARS OR MORE. AND I'M JUST WONDERING. WHY IS THE PENTAGON STICKING WITH THE OSPREY WHEN IT'S GOT JUST A TROUBLED HISTORY. DO THEY NEED IT THAT BADLY? I TALKED TO FAMILY MEMBERS WHO HAVE A KID WHO BUYS TOPPERS AND PLANES. THEY DON'T WANT THAT KID FIGHTING OSPREY. >>. THAT IS A DIFFERENT ANSWER FOR DIFFERENT SERVICES. THE AIRPORT ONLY HAS A HANDFUL OF THEM AND THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MAINTAIN OPERATIONS WITHOUT A HICCUP, AND THE MARINE CORPS IS A DIFFERENT CASE. THEY HAVE ABOUT THEIR HUNDRED 50 OF THESE AND THEY ARE THEIR MAIN. PEOPLE MOVER WHEN IT COMES TO A VOTER AIRCRAFT. SO IT IS A HELICOPTER AND TURNED INTO A PLANE HIM UP AT THIS IS THEIR MAIN, AND IT HAS HAD A REAL IMPACT, OPERATIONALLY, TO THE POINT THAT THERE, MARINE CORPS IS IN MID-JANUARY OUT OF OPERATIONAL NECESSITY AND THEY STARTED PUTTING SOME OF THEM BACK IN THE AIR AND IMPLEMENTING NEW SAFETY, IMPLEMENTING NEW SAFETY PROCEDURES, AND SINCE THEN IT HAS BEEN SIX WEEKS WHERE THEY HAVE NOT SEEN ANY SAFETY CONCERNS BUT THEY WOULD ARGUE THAT THEY NEEDED ON A DAY-TO DAY BASIS >>. I CAN THROW ANY QUESTION AT YOU AND YOU KNOW THE ANSWER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, COVERING IT ALL FROM THE PENTAGON >>> COMING UP SURPRISE MOVE FROM THE FDA AND WHY THEY ARE DELAYING APPROVAL. >>> A BIG CHANGE FOR STUDENTS TAKING THE SAT THIS WEEKEND. YOU WILL WANT TO STAY TUNED FOR THAT >>>. WE ARE BACK ON ONE OF THE >>>. WE ARE BACK ON ONE OF THE WORLD'S BIGGEST COMPANIES THAT CANNOT SEEM TO GET RUSSIAN SPIES OUT OF THE COMPUTER SYSTEM.

THE HACKING GROUP ALLEGEDLY HAS TIES TO RUSSIA'S VERSION OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY AND IS THOUGHT TO BE ONE OF THE BIGGEST TAX IN US HISTORY. KEVIN COLLIER IS ON THE STORY. >>. ONE WOULD THINK THAT MICROSOFT HAS ROBUST SECURITY PROTOCOLS. WHY ARE THEY STRUGGLING TO KICK RUSSIANS OUT OF THE SYSTEM? >>. YOU ARE NOT THE ONLY ONE ASKING THAT. A LOT OF CRITICS ARE POINTING TO THE FACT THAT THIS IS A COMPANY OF ONE OF THE MOST SOPHISTICATED TECH COMPANIES IN THE WORLD THAT YOU WOULD MAYBE WANT BETTER THE SAME TIME. THIS IS RUSSIA'S TEAM AND THE GROUP IS BEING EXCUSED HERE AND IT IS EQUIVALENT OF THE US, AN ESSAY AND, IN CYBER TERMS, THE HACKING GROUPS AS ADVANCED, PERSISTENT THREAT THE EARLY PERSISTENT AND HAVE BEEN DOGGING AT IT. PER MICROSOFT'S DESCRIPTION. THEY ARE CONSTANTLY TRYING TO GET IN. >>. WHY ARE THE HACKERS SPECIFICALLY TARGETING MICROSOFT? DO WE KNOW THAT? >>. I SPOKE TO THE VICE PRESIDENT AT CROWD STRIKE AND HE POINTED OUT THAT MICROSOFT HAS ENORMOUS GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS WITH THE US GOVERNMENT AND ALL KIND OF NATO GOVERNMENTS AND GOVERNMENTS AROUND THE WORLD. IF YOU WANT TO LOOK AT RUSSIA AS A UNCIAL ELECTION INTERVIEWER, THAT IS A LOT OF INTELLIGENCE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. A LOT GOING ON THERE WITH MICROSOFT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, KEVIN. >>>.

NOW A NEW JOBS REPORT SHOWS THAT MORE JOBS WERE ADDED IN FEBRUARY THAN EXPECTED, WITH 275,000 NEW JOBS, SHOWING SIGNS OF A STRONG JOBS MARKET. THE GOOD NEWS GROUP, JOB GROWTH, IS THAT THERE ARE SOME WORRISOME NEWS AS WELL. LAYOFFS IN FEBRUARY HIT THE HIGHEST LEVEL FOR THAT MONTH SINCE THE FINANCIAL CRISIS BACK IN 2009.. NUMBERS LIKE THAT ARE CONCERNING FOR ANYONE LOOKING FOR JOBS. GENERATION Z AND JENNIFER MILLENNIAL'S HAVE FOUND A HACK, IF YOU WILL TO GIVE THEM SOME JOB SECURITY. JULIE TSIRKIN HAS THE STORY >>. IF YOU ARE ON SOCIAL MEDIA, YOU HAVE SEEN THESE VIDEOS ALL OVER YOUR FOR YOU PAGE >>. I'M GETTING LAID OFF TODAY >>. JOB CUTS, NO MATTER THE INDUSTRY, CAN BE FOUND ALL OVER THE HEADLINES, SO AVOID BEING ANOTHER ONE OF THE 160,000 LAYOFFS THIS YEAR. ALONE, GENERATION Z AND MILLENNIAL'S FALL -- CALL IT A QUICK AND GOING PUBLIC. MANY ARE LOOKING TO LOCKDOWN GOVERNMENT. JOBS FOR SECURITY >>. BESIDES THE BENEFITS BUT ALSO ONE OF THE REASONS, BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT GOING TO GET LAID OFF VERSUS THE PRIVATE SECTOR >>. Reporter. 70% OF THE CLASS OF 2024 SAY THAT THEY ARE LIKELY TO APPLY TO A CHILD. THAT PROMISES STABILITY. >>. WE HAVE TO HAVE A GOVERNMENT. IF WE DON'T, OUR SOCIETY IS IN TROUBLE. IT IS NOT THAT YOUR JOBS ARE FOREVER NECESSARILY, BUT THE ORGANIZATION IS THERE. >>. SALARY WORKERS HOLD THEIR JOB FOR THREE MORE YEARS ON AVERAGE THAN IN PRIVATE. THE YOUNGER GENERATION IS BEGINNING TO NOTICE GOVERNMENT. JOBS ON TIKTOK HAVE MORE THAN 23 MILLION VIEWS. >>. NEED TO STOP APPLYING FOR JOBS >>. Reporter. FEDERAL JOBS RECEIVED TWICE AS MANY APPLICATIONS. THE PAYCHECK IS PROBABLY SMALLER. ON AVERAGE, FEDERAL WORKERS EARNED ABOUT 22% LESS THAN THE PRIVATE SECTOR WORKERS WITH SIMILAR RULES FOR MANY.

HOW DOES POLITICS PLAY INTO ALL OF THIS? >>. IT DEFINITELY IS A HOT BUTTON ISSUE. UNDER PRESIDENT BIDEN, CERTAINLY WORKING FOR THE GOVERNMENT, MIGHT SOUND LIKE A GOOD IDEA. THE STOCK THAT CAME OUT TODAY- 52,000 OF THOSE JOBS WERE GOVERNMENT JOBS, WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE MONTHLY AVERAGE THAT WE HAVE SEEN. HERE IS THE THING TRAGEDY FIVE- WHO IS LIKELY TO BE THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE FOR PRESIDENT SPACING OFF AGAINST BIDEN, PROMISING TO SLASH GOVERNMENT JOBS AND SPENDING WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT YOU SEE REPUBLICANS HAMMERING DEMOCRATS ABOUT CONSTANTLY AND THE SENATE IS PASSING THE GOVERNMENT FUNDING BILLS. THIS IS AN AREA IN WHICH REPUBLICANS ARE CONSTANTLY SAYING LET'S SPEND LESS, AND POTENTIALLY SHRINKING THE AMOUNT OF JOBS IN THE GOVERNMENT WORKFORCE. THIS IS HAPPENING WHEN IT COMES TO THE NOVEMBER ELECTION. BUT YOU HEARD BRANDON SAY THAT THIS IS AN INDUSTRY THAT HE IS LOOKING TO JOIN IN TERMS OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR. HE SAW THOSE VIDEOS ON TIKTOK AND THEY ARE LOOKING FOR THAT STABILITY AND SECURITY THAT THE PUBLIC SECTOR JOBS CAN OFFER >>. THERE IS SOME IRONY: THE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE ON TIKTOK BECAUSE THEY WANT A GOVERNMENT JOB. THE GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO SHUT DOWN TIKTOK >>. THAT'S A GOOD POINT. >>. THANK YOU SO MUCH. >>>. ARE YOU WATCHING THE BIGGEST STAR IN COLLEGE BASKETBALL HITTING THE COURT ON THE BIGGEST STAGE, CAITLIN CLARK KICKING UP FOR A TITLE TO CHASE THE NIGHT STARTING IN MINNEAPOLIS THE IOWA HAWKEYE'S TAKE ON PENN STATE AS THE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT. FOR THE RECORD THAT WE CHECKED, THE MEN TOURNAMENT STILL HAS THOUSANDS OF UNSOLD TICKETS FOR THE WOMEN SOLD OUT. GIRL POWER- THAT IS FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER IN THE BIG TEN EXPECTS THIS YEAR'S CROWD TO MORE THAN DOUBLE LAST YEAR'S RECORD ATTENDANCE- PRETTY MUCH. ALL OF IT IS THANKS TO CLARK. NOW THE FOURTH ALL-TIME LEADING SCORER. MALE OR FEMALE ARE SURPASSING JUST THIS WEEK. SHAQUILLE BREWSTER FOLLOWING ALL OF THIS FROM CHICAGO, DRIVING THIS INSANE BURST OF POPULARITY IN THE WOMEN'S GAME AND THE TV NUMBERS ARE RIVALING >>. WE HAVE SOME FIRM NUMBERS WHO MATCH REALLY, WHAT MOST OF US KNEW ALREADY. THAT CAME YOU WERE REFERENCING. WE SAW CAITLIN CLARK BEAT THE RECORD FOR SCORING. IT RIVALED BOTH NBA GAMES AND SOME OF THE BIGGEST GAMES OF THE YEAR. LOOK AT THE COMPANY. IT'S IN YOU SEE BOTH GAINS HAPPENED DURING THE HOLIDAYS AND IT WAS THE FIRST EVER NBA SEASON TOURNAMENT FINAL. THEN YOU HAVE THAT COMPETITIVE GAME WITH CAITLIN CLARK. IT'S NOT JUST ON TV WHERE YOU SEE A LOT OF THE EXCITEMENT. I HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING LOCAL COVERAGE OF THE BIG TEN TOURNAMENT HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IN MINNEAPOLIS. YOU HAVE PEOPLE LINING UP AROUND THE STADIUM AND ARENA FROM 5:30 AM THIS MORNING AND BECAME JUST STARTED IN THE PAST. COUPLE OF MINUTES. PEOPLE ARE PUMPED UP. THIS IS NOT EVEN THE CHAMPIONSHIP. IT IS THE CONFERENCE SEMI FINALS. SO PEOPLE ARE PUMPED UP AND CAITLIN CLARK HAS A LOT TO DO WITH IT >>. I ALWAYS LOVED COLLEGE BASKETBALL OR FOOTBALL, BECAUSE IT IS WRONG AND THERE IS PASSION AND ENERGY. TALK TO ME ABOUT WHETHER HER SUCCESS, BECAUSE IT TAKES A TEAM EFFORT. CAN IOWA GET THERE TO THE CHAMPIONSHIP AND HER SUCCESS ALONE? LIFT THEM TO THE CHAMPIONSHIP >>. IT'S POSSIBLE. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE ROOTING FOR THAT. SHE HAD A GREAT YEAR LAST YEAR AS WELL. THEY CAME UP SHORT AGAINST LSU. LOOK AT WHAT PEOPLE ARE BETTING ON. THAT IS A GOOD SENSE. OUR FRIENDS AT FANDUEL ARE LOOKING AT THE NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT. YOU CAN TO THE SOUTH CAROLINA GAME WITH THE FAVORITES, BUT LSU SOME INTERESTING NUGGETS. THERE WITH IOWA WILL BE THE SOUTH CAROLINA GAME BY FOUR POINTS LAST YEAR, THEN THE QUARTERFINALS. SO ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE ROOTING FOR IT. RIGHT NOW IOWA IS PLAYING AND THEY ARE UP 8-0.. >>. THANKS, HAVE A GREAT WEEKEND. >>>. NBC NEWS COVERED HUNDREDS OF INTERNATIONAL STORIES EACH DAY AND WE CAN'T GET ALL OF THEM ON AIR, BUT IT IS TOUGH TO READ, WATCH AND LISTEN TO EVERYTHING. OUR TEAMS AROUND THE WORLD HAVE BROKEN DOWN A FEW. HERE IS WHAT THEY ARE WATCHING. >>> BREAKING NEWS FROM NIGERIA: GUNMEN ATTACKING A SCHOOL AND KIDNAPPING MORE THAN 200 STUDENTS. ADOPTIONS LIKE THIS HAVE BEEN COMMON IN NIGERIA FOR THE LAST DECADE, OR SO. THE STATE GOVERNOR PROMISES TO GET THE STUDENTS BACK. NO GROUP HAS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACK. PARENTS ARE BLAMING THE ATTACK ON A LACK OF SECURITY IN THE AREA. >>> THE COUNTRY OFFICIALLY INSCRIBING THE RIGHT TO ABORTION IN THIS CONSTITUTION. ON INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY. THE GOVERNMENT HELD A SPECIAL PUBLIC CEREMONY TODAY TO SEAL THE AMENDMENT. THAT COMES AS FRANCIS PREVACID AND -- PRESIDENT SAYS HE WANTED TO BE AT THE RIGHT EUROPEAN LEVEL. >>>. FROM AUSTRALIA, A BUNCH OF KANGAROOS ON A GOLF COURSE. HUNDREDS OF THEM ARE INTERRUPTING A GAME AND WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHERE THEY CAME FROM OR WHERE THEY ARE GOING. A GOLFER BEHIND THE CAMERA SAY: >> NEWS FOR THE GENERATION OF NOW IS NBC NEWS NOW. NOW IS NBC NEWS NOW. >>>. BACK WITH JEANETTE ORIGINAL, WITH IN-DEPTH REPORTING ON TOPICS THAT WE KEEP AN EYE ON AROUND HERE TONIGHT: THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN GAZA GOING WORSE BY THE HOUR. THE TEMPER REPORTS THAT TIKTOK ANNOUNCED LAST NIGHT IT COULD TAKE UP TO 60 DAYS TO BE FULLY OPERATIONAL. THAT IS ACCORDING TO TWO SENIOR US OFFICIALS. THE US WAS HOPING THAT THE FLOATING DOCK COULD HELP WITH FOOD AND SUPPLIES ARRIVING FROM THE MEDITERRANEAN DIRECTLY INTO GAZA. THEY ARE GOING MORE DIRE BY THE DAY. HOUR AND CHILDREN MANY YOUNGER THAN THE WAR ITSELF. MEAGAN FITZGERALD HAS MORE >>. Reporter. THE AGONY AND DEVASTATION IS DEEPENING. IT IS THE MOST VULNERABLE. WE ARE PAYING THE HEAVIEST PRICE. THE INNOCENCE OF CHILDREN STRIPPED AWAY AS THOUSANDS BECOME CASUALTIES OF THE WAR. THOSE WHO HAVE SURVIVED SO FAR ARE LEFT WITH IMMEASURABLE TRAUMA. >>. THIS IS BY FAR THE WORST SITUATION THAT INVOLVES CHILDREN. >>. Reporter. SO DIRE THAT STARVING CHILDREN ARE FORCED TO EAT ANIMAL FEED, CAGES FOR ANIMALS TURNED INTO BEDS FOR CHILDREN, TRAPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF UNSPEAKABLE HORRORS, AS THE ONE FRANTICALLY WARNS THAT GAZA IS ON THE BRINK OF FAMINE. THE GAZA HEALTH MINISTRY SAYS AT LEAST 20 PEOPLE HAVE DIED, AND OVER A DOZEN OF THEM ARE CHILDREN, IN JUST OVER ONE WEEK FROM STARVATION AND DEHYDRATION. FOR THOSE KIDS, LUCKY ENOUGH TO ESCAPE. LIKE EMILY AND HER FIVE KIDS, LIFE GOES ON. FIRST MET THE FAMILY JUST HOURS AFTER THEY ESCAPED GAZA WHEN AMERICANS WERE ALLOWED TO LEAVE. >> COMPACTING AND I CAN COME. >>. DIFFICULTY ADJUSTING TO NORMAL LIFE AND STRUGGLING TO GET BACK TO SOME TYPE OF NORMAL IT IS CONSTANTLY ON OUR MIND >>. Reporter. SURVIVOR'S GUILT HAUNTS HER ENTIRE FAMILY, ESPECIALLY FOR THE BOYS. >> I THOUGHT YOU'D WANT TO GO TO THE PARK >>. I FEEL THAT FROM A FAMILY IN GAZA, BECAUSE THEY CAN'T GO OUTSIDE AND THEY GET HURT AND STUFF, I FEEL BAD >>. Reporter. THEIR OLDER COUSIN WAS THERE BEST FRIEND. THE FAMILY SAID THAT HE DIED IN AN ISRAELI DRONE STRIKE THE DAY AFTER CHRISTMAS, WHILE WALKING ON A STREET IN GAZA. ON A STREET IN GAZA. IT WAS HIS 13th BIRTHDAY. MORE THAN 1 MILLION CHILDREN IN GAZA NEED MENTAL HEALTH REPORT WITH ALMOST NO ACCESS. THESE MAKESHIFT TRAUMA TENTS ARE MEANT TO BE A SAFE SPACE FOR KIDS TO JUST BE KIDS, OR EVEN JUST A MOMENT. THE UN SAYS THAT THE CHRONIC EXPOSURE TO VIOLENCE MAY BE THROWING THE SEEDS OF AGGRESSION. THE PARENTS OF THESE KIDS SAY THEY ARE SCARED BECAUSE THEY SEE WHAT IT'S LIKE FOR THEM. THERE ARE FEW ALTERNATIVES TO RESISTANCE AND IT'S DIFFICULT TO KEEP THE KIDS AWAY FROM THAT PATH, BECAUSE SO MANY HAVE HELPED THAT HAD BEEN DESTROYED A CONTINUOUS TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER >>. THAT WILL FEEL IN THE HEARTS THAT I WANT TO AVENGE FROM APPEARANCE. I AM WRITING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT HASN'T BEEN DISCUSSED OR SPOKEN ABOUT. THE PALESTINIAN KIDS WERE COMMITTING BEFORE THE WAR IN COMMITTING BEFORE THE WAR IN 2022.. THEY HAVE BEEN STRIPPED OF EVERYTHING GOOD IN LIFE >>. Reporter FOR EMILY'S OLDEST DAUGHTER, FOR HER HEALING IS LIVING HER LIFE. THAT THE THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN WILL NEVER GET THE CHANCE >>. I DO MY BEST. I AM ABLE TO LIVE. I WILL NOT. I AM ABLE TO LIVE. I WILL NOT WASTE THE OPPORTUNITY I HAVE FOR RIGHT NOW. UNICEF SAYS THAT THERE ARE 70,000 KIDS IN GAZA HAVE LOST ONE OR BOTH PARENTS OR SEPARATED FROM THEM. THESE KIDS ARE NOW ORPHANS. THE CONCERN HERE IS THAT THE NUMBER WILL ONLY GROW AS THE WAR IS ON.",[52]
261,VkmaGkfjjPA,This Morningâ€™s Top Headlines â€“ March 7 | Morning News NOW,NBC News,2024-03-07 14:19:49+00:00,">>. THE QUESTION IS: CAN I FIT INTO A DeLOREAN GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US ON THIS THURSDAY? I AM JOE FRYER >> AND I AM SAVANNAH GUTHRIE. THE WEAPONS SUPERVISOR FOUND GUILTY FOR HER ROLE IN THE FATAL SHOOTING OF HALYNA HUTCHINS. >>. THE JURY DELIBERATED FOR JUST UNDER THREE HOURS THE TRIAL THAT CENTERED ON THE 2021 SHOOTING FINDING HER GUILTY OF TWO COUNTS OF INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER. THE JURY RETURNS A NOT GUILTY VERDICT ON EVIDENCE TAMPERING AND SHE FACES UP TO THREE YEARS IN PRISON. HER LAWYERS SAY THEY WILL APPEAL THE VERDICT AND THE PROSECUTION SAID SHE ACTED IRRESPONSIBLY ON THE SET OF RUST. >>. THIS IS AN INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER CHARGE BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T KNOW THERE WERE LIVE ROUNDS ONSET AND THE REASON SHE DIDN'T KNOW WAS THROUGH- HER OWN NEGLIGENCE, HER OWN RECKLESSNESS. >>. DANNY CEBALLOS JOINS US NOW TO BREAK IT ALL DOWN. IT TOOK JUST TWO ND HALF HOURS TO REACH THIS VERDICT. ARE YOU SURPRISED AT ALL OR IS THIS WHAT YOU EXPECTED? >>. I AM NOT SURPRISED. THE ONLY EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMEONE SAW A WHITE BAG OF POWDER AND IT WAS NEVER TESTED. I AM NOT SURPRISED ON THE VERDICT. IF THERE WAS A CASE TO BE MADE, THE STRONGEST CASE IS ALWAYS AGAINST THE ARMOR BUT THE STATE CASE ACTUALLY ENDED UP BEING STRONGER THAN I EXPECTED. THEY HAD A LOT OF PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE, A LOT OF TESTIMONIAL EVIDENCE, A LOT OF STATEMENTS FROM THE DEFENDANTS AND OTHERS- WHICH, BY THE WAY, THIS ENTIRE CASE WAS BUILT AGAINST THE ARMOR, MOSTLY ON STATEMENTS SHE GAVE THAT WERE ON BODY CAMERA: VIDEO FROM BELIZE OR WHEN SHE CAME FROM BELIZE OR WHEN SHE CAME DOWN -- TO INTERVIEW. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE CASE. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE CASE WAS MADE AGAINST THE ARMOR. SHE DID HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY. EVEN IF OTHER PEOPLE SHARE THAT RESPONSIBILITY- NOT A HUGE SURPRISE. IF THERE IS A GUILTY VERDICT, IT WILL BE AGAINST HER. >>>. TELL US HOW THE PROSECUTION LAID OUT THE CASE. >>. YOU JUST SAW A GREAT EXAMPLE. WE ARE NOT SAYING THAT SHE POTENTIALLY PUT THE LIVE ROUNDS ONSET. THAT IS WHAT NEGLIGENCE IS TO HER NEGLIGENCE. THEY INTRODUCED PHOTOGRAPHS OF GUNS BEING USED NEGLIGENTLY ON THE SET. THEY DID A GOOD JOB OF INTRODUCING THAT EVIDENCE. WHERE I THINK THEY DID NOT DO A GREAT JOB IS THAT THEY PROMISED IN THE OUTSET: WE WILL SHOW YOU WHERE THESE LIVE ROUNDS CAME FROM. ALSO, WHO ELSE COULD THEY HAVE COME FROM BUT THE ARMORER? WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE, THEY DID MAKE A GOOD POINT THAT THESE ROUNDS, BLANKS AND LIVE ROUNDS OR SOMETHING THAT THEY ARMORER SHOULD HAVE KNOWN IF SHE WAS CHECKING BUT DUE TO NEGLIGENCE, THE LIVE ROUNDS ENDED UP TRAGICALLY IN THE FIREARM CAPABLE OF SHOOTING IT. >> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE MOMENT BEFORE THE CLOSING ARGUMENTS. >> SHE CANNOT ANTICIPATE. IT WAS NOT FORESEEABLE. MANAGEMENT WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR SAFETY FAILURES. THERE IS ZERO EVIDENCE OF COCAINE, NO TESTING. I GO BACK TO THE IDEA THAT HANNAH IS A SCAPE GOAT. THEY DO HOPE SHE GETS CONVICTED. THEY ARE ALL EXONERATED AND CAN MOVE FORWARD. >> THE JURY DID NOT BUY THAT. >> THE JURY DID NOT BUY THAT ARGUMENT. CAN I MAKE MY SECOND PSA? IF YOU WATCHED THIS AND THE FULTON COUNTY HEARINGS IN GEORGIA LAST WEEK, YOU SAW PEOPLE COMMIT THE CARDINAL SIN, WHICH IS THE POWERPOINT DURING CLOSING WITH LOTS OF WORDS ON IT, AND WHAT YOU SAW WAS HIM READING FROM THAT POWERPOINT. YOU'RE ASKING A JURY TO READ WHILE YOU READ ALONG. AND SHOULD I READ? SHOULD I LISTEN? SHOULD I LISTEN TO YOU READING? I THINK THIS IS A CARDINAL SIN AND YOU SHOULD NOT DO IT. LOOK AT THAT CADENCE- NOT VERY DYNAMIC. YOU END UP READING A BOOK FROM A PULPIT, NOT EXCITING. THAT IS MY SECOND AND FINAL PSA. BUT THE DEFENSE'S ARGUMENTS WERE REALLY THAT OTHER PEOPLE DID THIS. THIS WAS OTHER PEOPLE'S RESPONSIBILITY AND ULTIMATELY, IN THE END THE STATE HAD THE STRONGER CASE, SHOWING THAT IF EVEN OTHER PEOPLE WERE RESPONSIBLE, THEY CONCEDED THAT. THAT IS A VERY EFFECTIVE TOOL COMING UP HERE TO SAY IT WAS A BUNCH OF OTHER PEOPLE'S RESPONSIBILITY. THOSE ARE ALL GOOD POINTS BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, THE ARMORER- HER NAME MEANS SHE IS INVOLVED IN- HAS PRIME RESPONSIBILITY. THIS ALL RAISES THE QUESTION OF ALEC BALDWIN, NOW CHARGED WITH INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER AND HAS PLED NOT GUILTY, SAYING HE DID NOT PULL THE TRIGGER. WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENCES? >>. FIRST, THE GUILTY VERDICT AND AN ACQUITTAL WOULD'VE BEEN GOOD FOR ALEC BALDWIN. THE STATE'S CASE IS WEAK AGAINST THEIR STRONGEST SUBJECT BUT THE ALEC BALDWIN TEAM HAS GOTTEN A FIRST LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE ALL AROUND. IT IS A PLUS FOR ALEC OLD ONE. HIS CASE IS DIFFERENT AND HE DID NOT HAVE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY AND THE OPERABILITY OF HOW THE FIREARM WORKS. THE BEST EVIDENCE IS HIS STUPID STATEMENTS THAT HE GAVE ONE, THAT HE WOULD NEVER POINT A GUN AT ANYONE. TWO, THAT HE WOULD NEVER PULL THE TRIGGER. THOSE WERE TWO DUMB THINGS TO SAY IN. THEY WILL BE EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM. >>>. TONIGHT, ON CAPITOL HILL, PRESIDENT BIDEN WILL DELIVER HIS HIGH-STAKES STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS AS A REMATCH TAKES SHAPE AGAINST THE PRESUMPTIVE GOP NOMINATION, DONALD TRUMP. >>. THE PRESIDENT HOPES TO WIN OVER DOLLARS AND GIVE HIS ELECTION CAMPAIGN A SHOT IN THE ARM, HIGHLIGHTING ACCOMPLISHMENTS OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS AND LAYING OUT THE CHOICE FACING VOTERS IN NOVEMBER. WE ARE JOINED BY MONICA ALBA AND RYAN NOBLES. GOOD MORNING TO BOTH OF YOU. >>. MONICA, THIS IS ABOUT THE STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS. WHAT DO WE KNOW? ABOUT WHAT WE CAN >> TONIGHT >>. THE STAKES ARE HIGH, THE SPEECH IS VERY LONG AND SOME OF THE MOMENTS THAT MIGHT BE A KEY TAKE AWAY ARE THE UNPREDICTABLE ONES THINGS THAT THE WHITE HOUSE CANNOT PLAN FOR, BUT DISCUSS HOW TO HANDLE, IF THEY DO TAKE PLACE, SOME OF THOSE SPONTANEOUS MOMENTS AND EVERY ACTION FROM THE CHAMBER BUT IN TERMS OF CONTENT, THIS IS REALLY PRESENT, A BONDS OPPORTUNITY. THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS TO TRY TO PUT EVERYTHING HE FEELS HE HAS ACCOMPLISHED IN ONE BUCKET AND FRAME, WHY HE WANTS TO DO THAT IN ANOTHER FOUR YEARS, FOR HIS REELECTION, IN A SEPARATE BUCKET. AND TRY TO MARRY THOSE TWO SCENES. AND DISCUSSED THAT IN THIS LARGER CONTEXT, DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY. HERE'S A LITTLE BIT MORE OF WHAT WE CAN. >> FROM THAT KIND OF MESSAGE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY YESTERDAY >> YOU WILL HEAR THE PRESIDENT LAYOUT THE HISTORIC ACHIEVEMENTS HE HAS DELIVERED ON FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND HIS VISION FOR THE FUTURE. THE PRESIDENT WILL OUTLINE AN AGENDA. THAT IS ABOUT CONTINUING TO BUILD ON THE PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. THE PRESIDENT HAS ALWAYS BEEN AN OPTIMISTIC PERSON AND, EVEN IN THE FACE OF CHALLENGES, HE WILL SHARE WHY HE IS HOPEFUL ABOUT THIS COUNTRY'S FUTURE. A MAJOR THING YOU WILL SEE IS THE PRESIDENT TALKING ABOUT LOWERING COSTS FOR AMERICANS- EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY NOT BE FEELING ALL OF THE EFFECTS OF THAT- AND ALSO TALKING ABOUT HIS ECONOMIC PLAN, WHILE OF COURSE TRYING TO NOT STIR THE ISSUE OF THE OTHER SIDE OF THE REPUBLICANS. THAT HE IS GOING TO BE DISCUSSING WITHOUT MENTIONING NECESSARILY THE NAME OF HIS GENERAL ELECTION OPPONENT OF COURSE, PRESIDENT TRUMP. >>. THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO DELIVER THIS SPEECH BEFORE A DIVIDED CONGRESS. THIS IS GOING TO BE MY JOHNSON'S FIRST STATE OF THE UNION. HE WILL BE RIGHT BEHIND THE PRESIDENT IN VIEW OF THE CAMERAS THE ENTIRE TIME. WHAT HAS HE BEEN SAYING ABOUT THIS? >>. SPEAKER JOHNSON BELIEVES THERE IS A DIFFERENT VISION FOR AMERICA BETWEEN REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS ON DISPLAY IN THE CHAMBER, WHERE MAYBE ONLY HALF OF THE AUDIENCE IS STANDING AND APPLAUDING CERTAIN POINTS DURING THE SPEECH. BUT JOHNSON DID A PRE BATTLE YESTERDAY, WHERE HE LAID OUT THE BIG DIFFERENCES HE SEES BETWEEN THE REPUBLICAN VISION AND THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION VISION. TAKE A LISTEN TO HOW HE RESPONDED: >>. IF YOU HAD TO DESCRIBE IN ONE WORD WHAT YOU BELIEVE HE STATE OF THE UNION IS, YOU HEARD THE WORD CRISIS, CATASTROPHE, I THINK, MAYBE A SUMMARY OF DECLINED. I SAY THAT WITH GREAT SADNESS, AND WE ALL DO, BECAUSE THIS PRESIDENT IS AN ADMINISTRATION THAT WE ARE INDISPUTABLY IN DECLINED >>. REPUBLICANS ARE TAKING A DIFFERENT PICTURE OF WHAT THE STATE OF THE UNION IS: AN PRESIDENT BIDEN. WHAT HE HOPES TO DO IS DEMONSTRATE THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT HIS ADMINISTRATION ISN'T ABLE TO GET OVER THE FINISH LINE, OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS, WHILE REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO ARGUE THAT -- AND THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS- THIS WILL BE HIS FINAL REASONS. THIS WILL BE HIS FINAL STATE OF THE UNION WHICH WOULD HAVE PROVIDED, WHICH WOULD HAVE PROVIDED ESSENTIAL FUNDING AND BORDER SECURITY. I THINK HE IS GOING TO SAY SOMETHING LIKE: WE PUT THIS ON THE TABLE IN THE MONTHS AFTER NEGOTIATIONS AND AT THE END OF THE DAY, BECAUSE OF SOME COMMENTS HE MADE OR ALLUDED TO FROM THE FORMER PRESIDENT. SO I THINK HE IS GOING TO BE CLEAR ABOUT THAT EVEN, THOUGH WE ARE REPORTING THAT HE IS NOT EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE ANY KIND OF EXECUTIVE ACTION WHEN IT COMES TO THE IMMIGRATION. HE COULD POSSIBLY DO THAT AT A LATER DATE, BECAUSE I AM TOLD BY SOURCES THAT THEY CAN DO NOTHING WHEN IT COMES TO THE BORDER. THERE IS SOMETHING THAT WILL HAVE TO HAPPEN IF THEY CANNOT GET CONGRESS TO ACT. >>>. AFTER THE SPEECH, WE WILL HEAR THE REPUBLICAN RESPONSE DELIVERED BY KATIE BRENT. WHAT SHOULD WE KNOW ABOUT HER? >>? SHE IS CERTAINLY A RISING STAR IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, A 42-YEAR-OLD MOTHER, ONE OF THE YOUNGEST MEMBERS OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE, AND SHE IS SOMEONE WHO IS ARTICULATE AND SOMEONE REPUBLICANS REALLY BELIEVE CAN SHARE. WHAT THEY BELIEVE IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE REPUBLICAN AGENDA AND THE DEMOCRATIC AGENDA. OF COURSE, THE RESPONSE TO THE STATE OF THE UNION IS OFTEN A SOUGHT-AFTER SPOT BUT IT S ALSO AN ENORMOUS CHALLENGE. IT IS DIFFICULT TO REPLICATE THE POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE OF WHAT HAPPENS INSIDE OF THE CHAMBER WITH A SPEECH THAT IS USUALLY DELIVERED IN A QUIET ROOM, DIRECTLY TO CAMERA AND WITHOUT THE ENERGY THAT YOU SEE INSIDE THE CHAMBER. BUT MANY BELIEVE THAT KATIE BRITT IS UP TO THE TASK, A VERY BRIGHT FUTURE. SHE HASN'T SPENT A LOT OF TIME BEHIND -- IN THE SPOTLIGHT. SHE HAS WORKED BEHIND THE SCENES. THIS IS HER MOMENT TO INTRODUCE HERSELF TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC >>. NOW THAT WE HAVE THE PRESUMPTIVE NOMINEE, WHAT EXACTLY HE SAYS MAY NOT BE REMEMBERED BY A LOT OF VOTERS, A LOT OF PEOPLE AT HOME? HOW HE SAYS IT, HIS PERFORMANCE AND HIS DEMEANOR MIGHT BE AS QUESTIONS OF HIS AGE LINGERED. HOW MUCH OF A CONCERN AND FOCUS IS THAT TONIGHT? >>. THE WHITE HOUSE WOULD SAY THAT YOU WILL SEE A VERY ENERGIZED PRESIDENT TONIGHT PUTTING SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS TO REST. A SPEECH: THAT IS A TELEPROMPTER SPEECH. HE HAS BEEN PRACTICING IT FOR SEVERAL DAYS. FOR YEARS THE PRESIDENT HAS TALKED ABOUT THIS. HE STRUGGLES WITH A STUTTER AND HAS ISSUES WITH HIS DELIVERY BECAUSE THEY PUT ALL OF THE PREP INTO THIS. THEY DON'T THINK THAT WILL BE AN ASPECT TO IT. WHERE THEY WILL COUNTER IS TO SEND THE PRESIDENT ON THE ROAD. HE WILL BE IN PHILADELPHIA TOMORROW, IN ATLANTA ON SATURDAY AND AFTER THE STATE OF THE UNION: THERE WILL BE A MASSIVE TRAVEL BLITZ. WE WILL SEE THE PRESIDENT OUT THERE ENGAGING WITH VOTERS IN A WAY WE HAVEN'T SEEN IN RECENT WEEKS. >>>. FOR MORE ON THE STATE OF THE UNION, WE ARE JOINED BY THE FORMER SPEECHWRITER FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA: GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. STATE OF THE UNION: THE STAKES ARE ALWAYS HIGH, ESPECIALLY IN ELECTION-YEAR, WHEN PRESIDENT BIDEN LOOKS AT THE POLLS AND WANTS TO BE DOING BETTER. WHAT DO YOU >> TO SEE? >>. FIRST OF ALL, THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME THIS MORNING. I THINK AS A SPEECHWRITER, ESPECIALLY IN A TEAM OF ONE OF EIGHT. IT IS A BIG NIGHT, BUT ALSO MORE THAN ONE NIGHT, BECAUSE FOR US- THE SPEECHWRITING OFFICE FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA- WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT THE STATE OF THE UNION, ALMOST AS A GUIDE FOR THE NEXT 3 TO 6 MONTHS. THAT WAS A WAY FOR US AND PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE GOVERNMENT TO THINK ABOUT IT AND THE UPCOMING ELECTION >>. WALK US THROUGH. WHAT IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW, MAYBE WHAT IS GOING ON OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS? HOW DO YOU INTERACT WITH THE PRESIDENT ABOUT THIS? >>. EVERY PRESIDENT IS DIFFERENT, BUT I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS YOU HEARD FROM PRESIDENT BIDEN STEAM IS THAT THE PRESIDENT IS INVOLVED IN HIS OWN STATE OF THE UNION. HE HAS SPEECHWRITERS AND THEY ARE WORKING TOGETHER, BUT THIS USUALLY COMES DOWN TO THE PRESIDENT TALKING TO THAT PERSON AND GOING BACK AND FORTH AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. HOW DO I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS? BECAUSE IT IS VERY RARE THAT WE KNOW THAT MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WILL BE WATCHING THIS SPEECH USUALLY. WE ARE WATCHING CLIPS OF 30 SECONDS OR LESS. LAST YEAR, 27 MILLION AMERICANS WATCHED THE STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS AND THAT BIG OF AN AUDIENCE IS HARD TO GET, EVEN FOR A PRESIDENT. THESE DAYS >>. YOU ARE THE WRITER AND THE WORDS ARE IMPORTANT, BUT WE CANNOT IGNORE WHAT THE POLLS ARE TELLING US, THAT PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT HIS AGE. HOW IMPORTANT IS THE PERFORMANCE TONIGHT >>. I THINK THE PERFORMANCE IS IMPORTANT, BUT PART OF THE WHITE HOUSE, JOB, IS THAT WE NEED TO GET PAST THEODORE CRITICISM. THIS IS ULTIMATE -- ULTIMATELY NOT ABOUT JOE BIDEN OR TRUMP, IT IS ABOUT US AND WHAT OUR NEXT YEARS WILL LOOK LIKE. AND I THINK WHAT YOU WILL SEE PRESIDENT BIDEN TONIGHT IS LAYOUT THE VISION FOR THE NEXT FOUR YEARS. THE QUESTION IS, WHAT ARE THE REST OF US? GOING TO EXPERIENCE AND THE OTHER THING? I WOULD LOOK SO -- FOR SOME OF THOSE UNSCRIPTED MOMENTS. THERE WAS A LOT OF HECKLING FROM MEMBERS OF CONGRESS. I DON'T KNOW WHEN THIS BECAME NORMAL, BUT SOMEHOW IT DID. THE WIND WAS AT HIS BEST LAST YEAR. THE SPEECH WAS GOOD AND I THINK THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS TO PUT CHARITABLY SOME OF HIS REPUBLICAN FRIENDS THINK HE IS NOT CAPABLE OF. I THINK YOU WILL BE DEMONSTRATING THAT. I THINK JOE BIDEN HAS BEEN DOING THIS FOR A LONG TIME BUT THE ABILITY TO SHOW POISE AND THE UNSCRIPTED MOMENT CAN BE JUST AS POWERFUL AS THE THING THAT THE SPEECHWRITERS HAVE BEEN WORKING ON FOR MONTHS. >>. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US THIS MORNING. WE WILL BRING YOU THE STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS AND THE ACCENTS OF LIVE COVERAGE GETS UNDERWEIGHT -- UNDERWAY TONIGHT AT 8:00 PM. >>> ALABAMA'S GOVERNOR HAS SIGNED A NEW BILL INTO LAW. SIGNED A NEW BILL INTO LAW PROTECTING PROVIDERS IN CASE. AN EMBRYO IS DESTROYED. >>. THE NEW BILL WILL ALLOW CLINICS TO RESTART TREATMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN ON HOLD. CRITICS SAY THE LAW DOESN'T GO FAR ENOUGH. BUT AT LEAST TWO FERTILITY CLINICS IN THE STATE ARE PREPARED TO RESUME TREATMENTS AS SOON AS THIS WEEK. >>> CEASE-FIRE TALKS AIMED AT HALTING THE WAR IN GAZA AND RELEASING HOSTAGES AS WELL AS PALESTINIAN PRISONERS HAS STALLED WITHOUT A BREAKTHROUGH. >>> TALKS WOULD CONTINUE TO TRY TO REACH A DEAL BY SUNDAY. INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE IS MOUNTING ON ISRAEL TO ALLOW MORE AID INTO GAZA. THE COORDINATOR FOR THE TERRITORY SAYS THEY ARE LOOKING. WE HAVE TO USE THIS MILITARY SITE TO COME FROM THE CROSSING POINT ALL THE WAY UP TO THE NORTH AND INTO THE NORTH, NORTH AND INTO THE NORTH. >>. RALPH SANCHEZ JOINS US. IS THERE ANY CHANCE THAT A DEAL? IS THERE ANY CHANCE THAT A DEAL WILL BE REACHED BY THE WEEKEND? >>. Reporter. IT S NOT CLEAR WHEN WE WILL NEXT SEE NEGOTIATORS BACK TO THE TABLE. IT SOUNDED LIKE BOTH SIDES WERE PRETTY MUCH AT ZERO POSITIONS. YOU WILL REMEMBER ISRAEL- EGYPT- WENT TO PARIS AND HAMMERED OUT A FRAMEWORK THAT WAS PRESENTED TO HAMAS AND THE HOPE WAS THAT THEY WOULD SAY YES TO IT. HAMAS CAME BACK WITH A COUNTER PROPOSAL AND A LOT OF THE ORIGINAL POSITIONS, INCLUDING DEMANDS TO END THE WAR ENTIRE REALLY --, ENTIRELY- AND TO REMOVE ALL FORCES FROM THE GAZA STRIP, SOMETHING IT IS NOT WILLING TO DO FOR THOSE PALESTINIAN CIVILIANS DESPERATELY SHORT OF FOOD, AND THE HOSTAGES STILL BEING HELD. NO SIGN OF A BREAKTHROUGH AT THIS POINT. >>. MANY RELIEF AGENCIES SAY ISRAEL IS BLOCKING AID GETTING INTO GAZA. TALK TO US ABOUT THIS GROWING PRESSURE ON ISRAEL TO LET MORE AID IN AND HOW ISRAEL IS RESPONDING. >>. Reporter. SO THE PRESSURE ON ISRAEL IS TO GET MORE AID INTO GAZA BUT ALSO TO MAKE SURE THE CONDITIONS EXIST INSIDE THE STRIP SO THAT AID CAN BE DISTRIBUTED. YOU HEARD FROM THAT A AND REPRESENTATIVE EARLIER. THE BIG PROBLEM IS NORTHERN GAZA, WHERE, ACCORDING TO HUMANITARIAN GROUPS, MILITARY RESTRICTIONS AND A COMPLETE COLLAPSE OF LAW AND ORDER ARE MAKING IT VERY DIFFICULT TO GET THAT AIDE OUT. I ASKED A SPOKESMAN ABOUT HIS RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT A CAN BE DISTRIBUTED STAFF. DO YOU ACCEPT ISRAEL AS FAILING IN THAT RESPONSIBILITY? >>. I CANNOT ADDRESS THAT, BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT, IN TERMS OF SECURING THE CONVOYS THEMSELVES, THAT IS SOMETHING THE NATIONAL ORGANIZATION IS RESPONSIBLE FOR. THERE ARE WAYS TO SECURE THESE IN THE SAME WAY THAT NATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS DO SO- MANY ORGANIZATIONS. WHERE THEY HAVE TO DELIVER HUMANITARIAN AID, IT IS THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO DO SO. IN THIS SITUATION AS WELL >>. YOU HAVE HEARD ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS SAYING ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS SAYING AGAIN, AGAIN --, AGAIN AND AGAIN. THAT THE PRESIDENT NEEDS TO REPEAT TONIGHT: >> 3500 NEW SETTLEMENTS IN THE OCCUPIED WEST BANK AND THAT IS CONSIDERED ILLEGAL UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW. TELL US ABOUT THIS, EXPLAIN IT TO US. AND WHAT IS THE REACTION FROM THE UNITED STATES? >>. Reporter FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT, WE ARE HEARING RELATIVELY STANDARD LANGUAGE. THEY ARE CRITICIZING THIS DECISION, SAYING THE SETTLEMENTS ARE A BARRIER TO A TWO-STATE SOLUTION. THEY ARE SAYING THIS IS CONTRARY TO INTERNATIONAL LAW. BUT WHAT WE SEE ARE THE SETTLEMENTS GET BIGGER AND BIGGER AND THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION SO FAR DECIDING NOT TO TAKE ANY ACTUAL MEASURES TO PUNISH OR SANCTION THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT FOR THE SETTLEMENT EXPANSIONS. WE HAVE SEEN THE ADMINISTRATION PUT SANCTIONS ON INDIVIDUAL SETTLERS IN THE WEST BANK ACCUSED OF COMMITTING ACTS OF VIOLENCE AGAINST THE PALESTINIAN CIVILIANS, BUT NO ACTION AGAINST THE SETTLEMENTS THEMSELVES. THERE HAD BEEN SOMETHING OF A PAUSE ON SETTLEMENTS BUT THIS RIGHT-WING GOVERNMENT UNDER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU DETERMINES TO KEEP IT. TO KEEP IT. >>> ANGIE LASSMAN >>. YESTERDAY IT WAS ALL ABOUT THE RAIN THE WHOLE THIRD OF THE EASTERN PART OF OUR COUNTRY. TODAY WE HAVE A COUPLE OF SPOTS PICKING UP ADDITIONAL RAIN BUT THE SYSTEM IS ON ITS WAY OUT, STRETCHING OUT INTO THE CAROLINAS DRIER CONDITIONS FROM HERE THROUGH THE REST OF YOUR DAY, THOSE NORTHERN PORTIONS OF NEW ENGLAND WHERE WE ARE DEALING WITH A LITTLE BIT MORE RAIN AND IT WILL START TO WRAP UP BY LUNCH TIME BUT BECAUSE OF THIS, WE ARE STILL DEALING WITH A COUPLE OF FLOOD. WATCH IS FOR PARTS OF NEW HAMPSHIRE AND MAINE. ALL OF THE OTHERS HAVE EXPIRED. NOW WE WILL WATCH FOR THE MIDDLE OF THE COUNTRY. TODAY WE WILL PICK UP SOME ADDITIONAL SNOW ACROSS THE ROCKIES. WE HAVE SOME RAIN TO DEAL WITH AND SOME STRONG STORMS FOR THE LATER PART OF TODAY AND EVEN AFTER DARK. AS WE LOOK AHEAD TO TOMORROW, WE START TO SEE THIS SYSTEM RAMPING UP ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES, THE MIDWEST. HEAVY RAIN AND STRONG STORMS ACROSS THE SOUTH AS WELL. THE SYSTEM ISN'T DONE. THE SYSTEM ISN'T DONE BY SATURDAY, A LITTLE FARTHER TO THE EAST AND WE HAVE SOGGY CONDITIONS ON TAP AND THE POTENTIAL OF A COUPLE OF MORE STRONG STORMS ACROSS THE SOUTH THIS AFTERNOON AND THIS EVENING. 6 MILLION PEOPLE UNDER THIS RISK OF SEEING STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS. WHAT DO WE HAVE AS FAR AS IMPACT HAIL, WITH THE GREATEST CHANCE OF OCCURRING ABOUT AN INCH AS POSSIBLE WIND GUSTS A TORNADO OR TWO TOMORROW AND MUCH LARGER AREA AFTERNOON AND EVENING- WE COULD BE TALKING NOCTURNAL TORNADOES: 20 MILLION PEOPLE ARE AT RISK OF THIS, INCLUDING MAJOR CITIES LIKE DALLAS, JACKSON, MOBILE AND NEW ORLEANS, ALL INCLUDED TOMORROW, AND WE HAVE HEAVY RAIN FOUR TO EIGHT INCHES, WIDESPREAD AN INCH TO TWO.",[52]

HAVE A GREAT WEDNESDAY. >>> BREAKING RIGHT NOW ON MORNING NEWS NOW DROPPING OUT. NBC NEWS HAS LEARNED NIKKI HALEY IS ENDING HER PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN TODAY AFTER A DISAPPOINTING SUPER TUESDAY. THE STATE IS SET FOR A 2024 REMATCH BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP AND JOE BIDEN SCOTT. IT HAS BEEN AN AMAZING DAY AND INCREDIBLE PERIOD OF TIME. >>. WE HAVE TEAM COVERAGE WHEN THE LATEST SUPER TUESDAY RETURNS ON WHAT HAPPENS NEXT. >>> STILL NO DEAL TO END THE FIGHTING IN GAZA WITH RAMADAN JUST DAYS AWAY. WE WILL BRING THAT THE LATEST OF THE NEGOTIATIONS AS THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS GROWS. >>>. THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION IS CRACKING DOWN ON CREDIT CARD FEES- WHAT IT MEANS FOR YOUR WALLET. >>> BAD FOUNDATION IF YOU WEAR MAKEUP WHILE WORKING OUT WHAT A NEW STUDY FOUND ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF SWEATING WITH PRODUCTS ON YOUR SKIN. >>> LET'S GET RIGHT TO THIS BREAKING NEWS. IN THE RACE FOR THE WHITE HOUSE FORMER UN AMBASSADOR WILL END HER CAMPAIGN. ACCORDING TO KEY SOURCES. >> THE NEWS COMES AFTER MILLIONS OF PEOPLE CAST VOTES ON SUPER TUESDAY, WITH A DOMINATING NIGHT FOR DONALD TRUMP. NIKKI HALEY LOST EVERY STATE EXCEPT VERMONT, WHICH WAS ONLY HER SECOND WIN IN 2024.. SHE ALSO CAME OUT ON TOP IN THE DC PRIMARY THIS LAST WEEKEND- DC PRIMARY THIS LAST WEEKEND, SHE HAS SET TO MAKE REMARKS. >>> DONALD TRUMP THINKING, LOOKING FORWARD TO THE GENERAL ELECTION. >>. THEY TELL ME THAT THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ONE LIKE THIS, NEVER BEEN ANYTHING SO CONCLUSIVE. NOVEMBER 5th IS GOING TO BE DOWN AS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT DAY IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. >>>. ADAM SCHIFF AND REPUBLICAN STEVE GARVEY WILL ADVANCE TO THE GENERAL ELECTION. IN THE CALIFORNIA SENATE RACE, UNDER CALIFORNIA ROLLS, THE TOP TWO VOTE GETTERS ADVANCED TO THE VOTE GETTERS ADVANCED TO THE GENERAL ELECTION. WE HAVE TEAM COVERAGE AHEAD THIS MORNING, RECAPPING SUPER TUESDAY WITH SENIOR POLITICAL MARK MURRAY. LET'S START ON DANIEL ISLAND IN SOUTH CAROLINA. LET'S GET TO THAT BREAKING NEWS ABOUT NIKKI HALEY'S CAMPAIGN. WHAT CAN YOU TELL US? >>. Reporter. GOOD MORNING, BEFORE THE SUN WAS UP IN SOUTH CAROLINA, WE WERE ABLE TO CONFIRM THE NEWS THAT NIKKI HALEY, LATER THIS MORNING, WILL BE ENDING HER BID FOR PRESIDEN. THIS IS AFTER SUPER TUESDAY, WHICH WAS A DIFFICULT NIGHT FOR THE HALEY CAMPAIGN, AND YOU ALSO HAVE TO IMAGINE THAT TRUMP WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE HAD A CLEAN SWEEP OF THESE SUPER TUESDAY STATES. AND THERE IS HALEY NOTCHING THAT WHEN BACK IN VERMONT. THAT MAKES HALEY THE FIRST WOMAN TO WIN TWO REPUBLICAN PRIMARY CONTEST. INITIALLY, SHE MADE HISTORY BY WINNING THE FIRST ONE IN DC OVER THE WEEKEND EVEN AS SHE LEAVES THE RACE, LEAVING A LEGACY FOR WOMEN TO COME BEHIND HER BUT FOR HALEY THIS MORNING I AM TOLD SHE IS NOT LIKELY TO ENDORSE IN THE SPEECH WE >> HER TO GIVE. AROUND 10:00 IN THE BUILDING BEHIND ME INSTEAD, ONE PERSON PUT IT TO US TO INVITE THE VOTERS AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE AN UPHILL CLIMB FOR THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE SOME OF THOSE FOLKS SAID THEY WOULD NEVER BE IN THE MARKET FOR TRUMP. >>. WHAT CAN WE >> TO SEE FROM HIM IN THE COMING DAYS? >>. Reporter. CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT THIS IS A PERSON WHO IS NOW SITTING THERE WITH THE NOMINATION WELL IN HAND? HE NO LONGER HAS ANY RIFLE. IT HAS BEEN CLEAR THAT. THAT HAS CHAGRINED HIM OVER THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS. HE COULD NOT WAIT TO PIVOT INTO THE GENERAL ELECTION POSTURE, LEADING TO SOME OF THE NAME- CALLING THAT HAS BECOME SO CHARACTERISTIC OF HIM FOCUSING ON HIS ONLY RIVAL, NIKKI HALEY. NIKKI WAS VERY CRITICAL OF THE FORMER PRESIDENT IN THESE WAITINWEEKS, ATTACKING HIM ON EVERYTHING, FROM HIS MORAL FIBER ON THE WORLD STAGE TO HIS MENTAL FITNESS. THOSE ARE ATTACKS AS SHE LEAVES THE RACE. THOSE ARE NOT GOING ANYWHERE BECAUSE SHE PROVIDED A REAL ECHO CHAMBER FOR THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN. TO AMPLIFY THE ATTACKS, THE CALL COMING FROM INSIDE THE GOP HOUSE CRITICIZING THE FORMER PRESIDENT, MADE IT LESS PARTY, NONAFFILIATED, AND MUCH MORE WHERE THEY CAN TAKE IT TO THE GENERAL ELECTION AND SAY: NOT JUST DEMOCRATS ARE SAYING THAT STUFF, BUT THE PEOPLE WHO RAN AGAINST HIM AND SERVED IN HIS ADMINISTRATION. AT ONE POINT >> YOU MENTIONED THAT WE DON'T. >>. HALEY, TO HAVE AN ENDORSEMENT, WALK US THROUGH THE TIMELINE TO THAT DEBATE STAGE, WHERE EVERYONE PUT THEIR HANDS UP TO WHERE SHE MIGHT BE NOW AND WHAT MIGHT BE GOING ON IN HER HEAD AS SHE TRIES TO FIGURE OUT HER NEXT STEP >>. Reporter. HERE IS THE PROBLEM WITH THE GOP LOYALTY PLEDGE, WHICH IS JUST A PIECE OF PAPER. IT IS NOT BINDING. THERE IS NOTHING THE RNC CAN DO TO ENFORCE IT. AS HALEY POINTED OUT OVER THE WEEKEND, SHE HAD TO SIGN THAT PAGE TO GET ON THE DEBATE STAGE. I WILL ALSO NOTE THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP NEVER SIGNED A PAGE LIKE THAT. TRUMP IN 2016,, DURING THE PRIMARY, WHEN I WAS COVERING IT, WAS SAYING THAT HE MIGHT NOT SUPPORT THE NOMINEE IF IT WAS ANYONE OTHER THAN HIM SOUND FAMILIAR. HE NOW HAS THE PARTIES FORCING THEMSELVES TO ASK OTHER CANDIDATES IF THEY WOULD ENDORSE THE PERSON WHO WOULD WIN, KNOWING FULL WELL. THE ONLY REASON THEY ARE ASKING IS BECAUSE OF THE GUY THAT IS ULTIMATELY GOING TO WIN THE NOMINATION. SOME REAL CIRCULAR LOGIC AT THE RNC. BUT HALEY NOW SAYING: I AM GOOD, SINCE THE PAPER IS NOT BINDING AND THE DEBATE IS OVER, I AM GOING TO DO WHAT I WANT TO DO AND WHAT SHE DOESN'T WANT TO DO IS ENDORSE TRUMP. >>. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US THIS MORNING. >>>. MARK MURRAY, WHAT ARE YOUR BIG TAKEAWAYS FROM LAST NIGHT? >>. Reporter. IT WAS A DOMINANT PERFORMANCE BY DONALD TRUMP ON SUPER TUESDAY. TRUMP ENDED UP WINNING 14 OUT OF THE 15 STATES IN THE CONTEST LAST NIGHT AND HIS ONLY LOSS WAS IN THE VERMONT PRIMARY. HE ENDED UP WINNING 94% OF THE DELEGATES THAT HAVE BEEN AWARDED SO FAR ON SUPER TUESDAY. AND AS YOU END UP SEEING NIKKI HALEY'S EXIT FROM THIS CONTEST THIS MORNING, THAT IS ABOUT A 1000 DELEGATE LEAD OVER NIKKI HALEY. NIKKI HALEY ENDED UP TELLING CHRISTIAN WALKER ON MEET THE PRESS THAT SHE WOULD CONTINUE TO STAY IN THE CONTEST AS LONG AS IT REMAINED COMPETITIVE. I THINK WE GOT OUR ANSWER LAST NIGHT. >>. AT THIS POINT, WE KNOW NIKKI HALEY, GOT 20, 30 WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. THESE ARE DEMOCRATS INTERESTED IN HER INDEPENDENCE AND STRESSED IT IN HER. WHO DO YOU THINK IT'S HER VOTE AS WE MOVE TO THE GENERAL ELECTION? >>. Reporter. IT IS GOING TO BE ABOUT HALF, AND DONALD TRUMP ENDED UP HAVING A DOMINANT PERFORMANCE AMONG SELF DESCRIBED REPUBLICANS. NIKKI HALEY DID VERY WELL, AS WE HAVE SEEN IN PREVIOUS CONTEST WITH MODERATES AND LIBERALS- AS WELL AS POLITICAL INDEPENDENCE BUT THERE IS A CLUE IN THE EXIT POLL THAT WE ENDED UP GETTING LAST NIGHT ABOUT WHO THESE NIKKI HALEY VOTERS ARE. IN VIRGINIA, FOR EXAMPLE, WE ENDED UP FINDING 51% OF NIKKI HALEY'S VOTERS APPROVE OF PRESIDENT BIDEN'S JOB PERFORMANCE, VERSUS 47% WHO SAY THEY DISAPPROVE. THAT 50-50 SPLIT IS A GOOD INDICATION ON THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO VOTE FOR JOE BIDEN- WHO MIGHT ALREADY BE JOE BIDEN VOTERS BEFORE THIS PRIMARY SEASON BEGAN- VERSUS THOSE REPUBLICANS- AGAIN ABOUT HALF- WHO ARE REPUBLICANS AND DONALD TRUMP NEEDS TO WIN BACK. >> FORMER. PRESIDENT TRUMP TALK TO HIS STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES. >>. Reporter. SAVANNA. AGAIN, THE PATTERN THAT WE ENDED UP SEEING LAST NIGHT WAS THAT HE DID SO WELL AMONG CONSERVATIVES AND REPUBLICANS. PRIMARY VOTER, AND THOSE ARE THE BEDROCK. THOSE ARE THE LETTERS YOU WANT. THOSE ARE THE LETTERS YOU WANT TO DO WELL WITH. IN A REPUBLICAN PRIMARY, THEY MAKE UP THE BULK OF THE VOTERS AND AS HE ENDED UP DOING IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND IOWA AND SOUTH CAROLINA, HE IS DOING VERY WELL LAST NIGHT IN NORTH VIRGINIA AND --. VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA WHERE HE DID NOT DO THAT WELL IS AMONG MODERATES AND INDEPENDENT. THAT HAS BEEN NIKKI HALEY'S LANE IN THIS RACE. SHE DID VERY WELL AND THAT IS AN INDICATION OF THE WORK HE HAS TO DO AT LEAST WITH HE REPUBLICANS WHO ARE OPEN TO VOTING FOR HIM COME NOVEMBER >>. WE PIVOT TO THE GENERAL ELECTION. LET'S FOCUS ON PRESIDENT BIDEN. IS THERE ANY CLUE ON HOW HE MIGHT DO IN NOVEMBER? HE DID NOT HAVE A STRONG CHALLENGER LIKE NIKKI HALEY BUT THERE WERE SOME OTHER PEOPLE ON THE BALLOT. WHAT DID WE LEARN? >>? Reporter. I THINK HE IS CRUISING HIS PARTY'S NOMINATION AND HE HAS VERY LITTLE COMPETITION. THERE WERE SOME STATES WHERE HE ENDED UP GETTING ALMOST ALL OF THE VOTES. THERE WAS A CONTEST IN MINNESOTA WHERE HE ENDED UP GETTING 70% AND YOU END UP HAVING UNCOMMITTED HIM GETTING A SIZABLE SHARE OF THAT VOTE. AND IN THE CONTEST, LIKE AMERICAN SAMOA, HE ENDED UP LOSING TO A NOAME, TO THE PERSON WHO WE HAVE NEVER EVEN HEARD OF CALLED JASON PALMER LAST NIGHT. INSTANCES OF MINORITY VOTERS. JOE BIDEN HAS CRUISED HIS PARTY'S NOMINATION. THE PARTY HAS DECIDED HE IS GOING TO BE THERE NOMINEE. WE WILL HAVE A GENERAL ELECTION OVER THE NEXT EIGHT MONTHS. >>. MARK MURRAY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >>>. THIS MORNING THERE IS A MAJOR SHAKEUP THAT COULD DETERMINE CONTROL OF THE SENATE. KYRSTEN SINEMA, AN INDEPENDENT ANNOUNCED SHE IS NOT RUNNING FOR REELECTION. >>. IN A BLISTERING VIDEO SHE POSTED ON ASK TOUTING HER ACCOMPLISHMENTS. WELL, SHE WAS IN OFFICE BEFORE BLAMING HER DECISION NOT TO RUN AGAIN ON THE CURRENT TOXIC POLITICAL, THE CURRENT TOXIC POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT >>. IT IS ALL OR NOTHING. >>. JULIE JOHNSTON IS NOW. HOW MUCH OF A SURPRISE IS IT THAT KRISTEN CINEMA IS NOT GOING TO RUN AGAIN AND WHERE DOES THIS LEAVE THE ARIZONA SENATE RACE >>. Reporter. IT WAS SOMEWHAT OF A SURPRISE TO THOSE ON CAPITOL HILL AND EVEN HER COLLEAGUES BUT THE FACT THAT SHE DECIDED NOT TO RUN IS NOT REALLY A SURPRISE TO THOSE OF US WHO HAVE COVERED HER AND WATCHED HER CLOSELY. I WAS TOLD BY SOME SOURCES THAT THE BIPARTISAN BILL WAS REALLY THE LINCHPIN TO DECIDE WHETHER SHE IS GOING TO CONTINUE FORWARD AND HAVE SOMETHING TO FORWARD AND HAVE SOMETHING TO RUN ON IN THE STATE, IN DEMOCRATS, OR WHETHER SHE IS GOING TO BOW OUT, BECAUSE SHE HAS SEEN THE WRITING ON THE WALL AND CERTAINLY THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED. IN THIS SITUATION, THE RACE IS EFFECTIVELY BETWEEN REPUBLICAN CARRIE LAKE, WHO WAS ON CAPITOL HILL YESTERDAY AND TOLD ME SHE HAS OTHER ENDORSEMENTS COMING- AND THE DEMOCRAT, WHO IS A MEMBER OF THE HOUSE AND HAS KNOWN HER FOR SOME TIME. I DID TALK TO LAKE YESTERDAY AT THE CAPITOL AND HERE IS WHAT SHE HAD TO SAY: >> WE DISAGREE ON PROBABLY EVERY POLICY. I APPRECIATE A COUPLE OF VERY STRONG POINTS. >>. CARRIE LAKE HAS HAD SOME VERY DISCOURAGING COMMENTS ON KRISTEN, CINEMA AND OTHERS BUT SHE DID SAY ONE OF THE THINGS SHE FEARS IS THE FILIBUSTER GOING AWAY. NOW THAT SHE IS OUT AND THAT IS SOMETHING. THAT THE SENATOR HAS ALSO VOTED TO PROTECT THE FILIBUSTER. CERTAINLY THIS WILL CHANGE. WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN THAT VERY COMPETITIVE RACE. >>. THAT WAS A WAY RACE DOWN TO TWO PEOPLE. HOW IS IT GOING? >>. JOHN, HE SAID HE HAS DECIDED TO RUN FOR THE NUMBER TWO POSITION, THE ONE WHO COUNTS THE VOTES AND ALSO VERY IMPORTANT. SO THAT LEAVES THIS. AND TOOK AWAY RACE BETWEEN JOHN CORNYN AND JOHN KUHN. HOWEVER, WE ARE LIKE NINE MONTHS AWAY FROM THIS DECISION EVEN HAPPENING. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT OTHERS COULD JUMP IN THE RACE. RICK SCOTT HAD JUMPED IN AND WHO IS CURRENTLY THE GUY IN CHARGE OF SENATE REPUBLICANS INTO CONGRESS. SO THERE'S A LOT THAT CAN HAPPEN. BUT RIGHT NOW IT IS BETWEEN THOSE TWO GUYS AND THEY ARE TRYING TO VOTE LOCKUP SUPPORT >>. JOHN VERSUS, JOHN VERSUS JOHN, YOU POINT OUT THAT THIS WILL NOT HAPPEN UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTION. SO HOW MUCH COULD THE ELECTION AND THE RESULTS, WHETHER TRUMP WINDSOR LOSES AND WHETHER THE REPUBLICANS TAKE CONTROL OF THE SENATE OR NOT, HOW MUCH DID JAZZ --. DOES THAT INFLUENCE? >>. IT DOES INFLUENCE. JOHN CORNYN AND JOHN KUHN. THEY HAD A TOUGH RELATIONSHIP BUT HE REALLY SEES THE WRITING ON THE WALL THAT THIS GUY IS GOING TO BECOME THE PARTY'S NOMINEE AND IF HE BECOMES PRESIDENT, THE MINORITY LEADER CERTAINLY HAS TO WORK WITH HIM. SO THAT WHEN HAVE SOME AFFECTS ALSO INTERESTING. I ASKED CARRIE LAKE THIS QUESTION YESTERDAY. SHE IS NO FAN OF McCONNELL. SHE SAYS SHE HAS NO PREDICTION YET. BUT SHE DID SAY THOSE VYING TO BE LEADER WILL COME OUT IN THE COMING DAYS. AND THAT COULD BE TELLING, BECAUSE SHE IS IN ALIGNMENT WITH TRUMP. AGAIN, TRUMP CAN ALWAYS PUT HIS THUMB ON THE SCALE, AS HE IS KNOWN TO DO, AND DECIDE THE LEADERS THAT WAY BUT WE HAVE A LOT OF TIME >>>. TURNING NOW TO THE WAR IN GAZA. AND HAMAS SAYS IT IS PUSHING AHEAD WITH CEASE-FIRE TALKS IN CAIRO. >>. WHILE THE MILITANT GROUP HAS BEEN LOCKED IN, ISRAEL DID NOT SEND A DELEGATION UNDER THIS SIX WEEK CEASE-FIRE DEAL BEING DISCUSSED. THERE WOULD BE A RELEASE OF HOSTAGES AND PALESTINIAN PRISONERS AND AN INCREASE IN AID TO GAZA'S STARVING POPULATION >>. WE KNOW THERE IS AN URGENCY TO GET THE DEAL DONE BEFORE THE START OF RAMADAN. SPECIFICALLY, WHERE DO THINGS STAND THIS MORNING AND WHAT IS THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION SAYING >>? Reporter. WE ARE CERTAINLY HEARING THE URGENCY FROM THE WHITE HOUSE, FROM THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION. OFFICIALS TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT BIDEN HAD TO SAY. >>. WE ARE IN THE HANDS OF HAMAS RIGHT NOW. THE ISRAELIS HAVE BEEN COOPERATING. WE WILL KNOW IN A COUPLE OF DAYS WE NEED TO CEASE-FIRE. THERE HAS GOT TO BE A CEASE-. THERE HAS GOT TO BE A CEASE- FIRE BECAUSE RAMADAN. IF THIS CONTINUES INTO RAMADAN, IT COULD BE VERY, VERY DANGEROUS STOCK. RAMADAN STARTS ON MARCH 10th. JUST A COUPLE OF DAYS AWAY. THE DELEGATION IN CAIRO SAYS NO AGREEMENT HAD BEEN MET YESTERDAY AND, POINTING A FINGER THIS MORNING, THEY DID NOT BOTHER TO SEND A DELEGATION TO CAIRO. WE ARE NOT HEARING THE SAME KIND OF URGENCY ABOUT HOSTAGE RELEASE NEGOTIATIONS >>. THE URGENCY OUTSIDE OF THAT SEEMS TO BE COMING FROM THE LEVEL OF STARVATION IN GAZA, WHICH IS WHY SO MANY PEOPLE WANT TO SEE A CEASE-FIRE, A CONVOY TURNED AWAY BY ISRAELI FORCES, AND ALSO A DAMNING NEW REPORT BY EXPERTS ACCUSING ISRAEL OF INTENTIONALLY STARVING PEOPLE IN GAZA, TARGETING A CONVOY'S. WHAT MORE CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THAT AND HOW ISRAEL IS RESPONDING? >>. Reporter. LANGUAGE ABOUT THOSE EXPERTS WHICH I WILL GET TO REMEMBER. THE WORLD FOOD PROGRAM PAUSED THE CONVOYS TO THE NORTH OF GAZA, WHERE ORGANIZATIONS, THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF MALNUTRITION AND SEVERE STARVATION ARE HAPPENING NOW. THEY PAUSED THOSE CONVOYS BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT GET THOSE TRUCKS SAFELY IN. A 14-TRUCK CONVOY WAS TURNED BACK BY THE MILITARY AT THE ONE BECAUSE IT CHECKPOINT. BECAUSE IT CHECKPOINT -- GAZA CHECKPOINT. THE ONLY WAY IS AIRDROPS AND OTHER OPTIONS BY C. THOSE ARE LAST RESORT. AND FROM THAT PANEL I WANT TO READ ONE LINE TO YOU FROM THESE UN EXPERTS. THEY SAY: ISRAEL IS INTENTIONALLY STARVING THAT GAZAN PEOPLE AND IT IS TARGETING CIVILIANS SEEKING AID. ISRAEL MUST END ITS CAMPAIGN OF STARVATION AND TARGETING CIVILIANS- AND THAT IS A DIRECT QUOTE- REALLY QUESTIONING ISRAEL'S COMMITMENT. >>. ISRAEL'S WAR CABINET MINISTER IS IN THE UNITED STATES MEETING WITH OFFICIALS OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS. WHAT CAME OUT OF THOSE TALKS? >>? Reporter. HE HAS BEEN IN THE UNITED STATES, THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN SPEAKING WITH THE SAME MESSAGE FROM THE SECRETARY OF STATE, BLINKEN FROM THE PRESIDENT: GET MORE AID. WHY IS ISRAEL PUTTING UP OBSTACLES AND ALL SIGNS OF THE WHITE HOUSE UPPING PRESSURE ON THE GOVERNMENT? EVEN THOUGH GIFT IS A MEMBER OF THE WAR CABINET AND HE IS AN INFLUENTIAL VOICE. HE IS NOT THE FINAL VOICE. HE IS HERE IN LONDON AND EXPECTED TO HAVE A MEETING WITH DAVID CAMERON. THE UK, SIMILARLY, HAS RUN OUT OF PATIENCE AND WE HEARD HIM YESTERDAY. HE IS VERY STRONG LANGUAGE PREVIEWING HIS MEETING OF TODAY, BUT THE FACT THAT HE IS IN THE UNITED STATES ARE NOW IN THE UK WAS NOT THROUGH THE BENJAMIN NETANYAHU GOVERNMENT, BENJAMIN NETANYAHU GOVERNMENT, OR THROUGH THE FOREIGN MINISTE. THAT REALLY SUGGESTS AND POINTS TO THE FACT THAT THE UK AND THE UNITED STATES ARE GETTING EXASPERATED. >>>. THE SOGGY WEATHER IS HERE TO STAY ON THE EAST COAST, BUT FLOOD WATCH IS FOR 30 MILLION PEOPLE STRETCHING FROM NEW PEOPLE, STRETCHING FROM NEW JERSEY TO MASSACHUSETTS. >>. UMBRELLAS ARE NEEDED AND WE HAVE ALREADY HAD A LINE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WORKING THROUGH SOUTH FLORIDA. THAT IS MOVING OUT, BUT WE HAVE LEFT OVER LINGERING RAIN ACROSS PARTS OF THE SOUTHEAST IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS, PLACES LIKE ATLANTA ALREADY PICKING UP A COUPLE OF INCHES OF RAIN AS WE LOOK FROM THE MID- ATLANTIC TO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY. WE HAVE ALREADY BEEN SOGGY FOR THE BETTER PART OF THE MORNING HOURS AND YOU CAN SEE IT HAS BEEN PRETTY QUIET ACROSS THE NORTHEAST SO FAR. THIS MOISTURE WILL START TO LIFT AND WE WILL BE DEALING WITH SOME BUSY CONDITIONS, ESPECIALLY ALONG THE I-95 CORRIDOR AS WE GET INTO THE REALLY IMPORTANT COMMUTE TIME. 30 MILLION PEOPLE, INCLUDING THOSE IN NEW YORK, BOSTON, ALL INCLUDED, WITH THE MAJOR CITIES, BEING IMPACTED BY THE POTENTIAL OF FLASH, FLOODING AND PLENTY OF MOISTURE WILL LIFT INTO THE AREA. WE HAVE A CHANCE FOR SOME IMPRESSIVE RAINFALL RATES: ONE OR TWO INCHES PER HOUR, A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, PROLONGED RAIN, NOT HARD FOR US TO SEE, THAT FLOODING, ESPECIALLY IN THE VULNERABLE AREAS. THIS EVENING YOU CAN SEE THIS RAIN WILL BE AROUND EVEN WELL. PAST THE AFTERNOON, COMMUTE WELL INTO THE EVENING. WE WILL STILL BE DEALING WITH THE RAINFALL FOR PORTIONS OF VIRGINIA. THAT IS SOMETHING WE HAVE TO WATCH FOR, AND THE MODERATE TO HEAVY RAIN WILL BE FROM VIRGINIA TO MAINE. THIS RAIN WILL STICK AROUND FOR THE FIRST HALF OF THE DAY FOR SOME LOCATIONS AND EVENTUALLY MOVE OUT. THAT SYSTEM MOVES OFFSHORE AND IT WILL BE LOOKING BETTER, BUT NOT. BEFORE WE DEAL WITH THAT EARLY RAIN FOR THE FIRST HALF OF THE DAY WE WILL SEE SOME DRIER CONDITIONS AND WE WILL GET THE MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS. RAINFALL TOTALS FROM ONE TO TWO INCHES UP TO THREE INCHES ACROSS THE NORTHEAST, THE FLASH FLOODING IS GOING TO BE SOMETHING WE CONTINUE TO HAVE AS A POTENTIAL, NOT JUST TODAY BUT INTO TOMORROW TOO >> GOT IT. >>>. MUCH MORE TO COME LATER THIS HOUR OVERDUE. WE WILL TELL YOU ABOUT A NEW CAP ON CREDIT CARD LATE FEES. THAT COULD SAVE CUSTOMERS MILLIONS OF DOLLARS >>> MORE LEGAL TROUBLE FOR THE DISGRACED SENATOR BOB MENDEZ. >> THAT WASN'T ME. >>. YOU GOTTA SEE THIS >>. STAY TUNED. NOW, WEEK NIGHTS AT 8:00 EASTERN 5:00, PACIFIC ON NBC NEWS NOW >>>. BOB MENENDEZ IS FACING NEW CHARGES THIS MORNING, ALLEGING THAT HE AND HIS WIFE HAVE OBSTRUCTED JUSTICE IN A BRIBERY CASE. HE NOW FACES A TOTAL OF EIGHT FEDERAL CHARGES >>. PROSECUTORS HAVE ALLEGED THAT HE AND HIS WIFE MAY HAVE USED POLITICAL INFLUENCE TO POCKET HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN BRIBES, INCLUDING CASH, GOLD BARS, USE TOWARD A HOME, MORTGAGE AND LUXURY VEHICLE. MENENDEZ SAYING YESTERDAY: I AM INNOCENT AND I WILL PROVE IT. NO MATTER HOW MANY CHARGES, THEY CONTINUE TO PILE ON BOTH. HE AND HIS WIFE HAVE PLED NOT GUILTY. >>> WHAT MORE CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THE NEW CHARGES? >>. Reporter. GOOD MORNING. PROSECUTORS ARE ACCUSING MENENDEZ AND HIS CODEFENDANT OF TRYING TO COVER UP A BRIBE BY MAKING IT LOOK LIKE A LOAN, AND THEY SAY THAT THEY LIED TO THEIR OWN LAWYERS AS PART OF THIS. THIS WAS DURING THE INVESTIGATION AND THAT THOSE LAWYERS INADVERTENTLY CONVEYED FALSE INFORMATION TO PROSECUTORS. >>. THE NEW INDICTMENT COMES DAYS AFTER ONE OF MENENDEZ'S CODEFENDANTS, A NEW JERSEY BUSINESSMAN. HE PLED GUILTY AND AGREED TO COOPERATE WITH THE PROBE. HOW MUCH OF A BURDEN IS THAT GOING TO BE TO THE CASE? >>. Reporter. THAT APPEARS TO BE THE SOURCE OF THESE NEW ALLEGATIONS. THIS NEW JERSEY BUSINESSMAN WAS ACCUSED IN THE INDICTMENT OF PROVIDING A MERCEDES FOR NADINE MENENDEZ AND MAKING PAYMENTS ON THAT CAR IN EXCHANGE FOR OFFICIAL ACTS BY THE SENATOR. TWO DAYS AGO HE AGREED TO COOPERATE AND PLEAD GUILTY, AND HE IS TELLING PROSECUTORS THAT AFTER A SUBPOENA WENT OUT ABOUT THE MERCEDES, MENENDEZ WENT TO HIM AND THEY CONCOCTED A FALSE STORY ABOUT THE PAYMENTS. AND THAT IS THE COVER-UP THE PROSECUTORS ARE ALLEGING: >> THIS IS NOT THE FIRST SUPERSEDING INDICTMENT. THE TRIAL DATE IS SET FOR MAY 6th. COULD THIS INDICTMENT HAVE ANY IMPACT ON THE TIMELINE? AND HOW LIKELY THAT WE COULD SEE EVEN MORE CHARGES >>. Reporter. PROSECUTORS ARE TELLING THE JUDGE. IT SHOULD NOT, BUT THAT IS THEIR VIEW. EXPANDING THE CHARGES BY 14 IS DEEPLY SIGNIFICANT. SOME OF THOSE LAWYERS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REPRESENT THE DEFENDANTS ANYMORE, BECAUSE THEY MAY END UP BEING WITNESSES >>>. IN GEORGIA, ASHLEY MERCHANT IS EXPECTED TO APPEAR BEFORE THE COMMITTEE INVESTIGATING FULTON COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY. ATTORNEY >>. SHE HAS BEEN LEADING THE CHARGE TO TRY TO REMOVE WILLIS FROM THE ELECTION INTERFERENCE CASE AGAINST TRUMP AND MANY OTHERS AND SAYS WILLIS FAILED TO DISCLOSE A ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP WITH NATHAN WADE, THE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR. BOTH HAVE DENIED ANY WRONGDOING >>. JOINING US IS LEGAL ANALYST DANNY CEBALLOS, THE FIRST PERSON SAID TO TESTIFY IN WEIGHTS RELATIONSHIP. WHAT DO YOU? >> THE FOCUS TO BE TODAY >>. Reporter. WE ALREADY KNOW IT IS GOING TO BE ABOUT WHAT DOES MERCHANT KNOW AND WHAT IS THE BASIS OF HER KNOWLEDGE AND WHAT IS THE BASIS OF HER BELIEF THAT ONE OF THE WITNESSES, TERRENCE BRADLEY, KNOWS A LOT MORE THAN HE TESTIFIED TO UNDERSTAND. MERCHANT MAY HAVE SOME OBJECTIONS BASED ON CONFIDENTIALITY, POSSIBLY WORK PRODUCT BUT IN ALL LIKELIHOOD SHE IS IN LINE WITH THE COMMITTEE AND TO SOME DEGREE, TO THE EXTENT THAT SHE BROUGHT OUT HER OWN WORK PRODUCTS DURING THE PROSECUTION. SHE MAY WAIVE THAT BUT SHE IS -- MAY NOT BE LOOKING TO EXPOSE THIS INFORMATION, BECAUSE SHE HAS AN INTEREST IN GETTING IT OUT THERE IN A PLACE WHERE THE RULES OF EVIDENCE DON'T CONSTRAIN HER THE WAY THEY DID IN COURT >> THIS ELECTION INTERFERENCE CASE WITH MANY CODEFENDANTS, AND ARE THERE ANY POTENTIAL ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGES AND A CONFIDENCE SHE MIGHT HAVE WHERE SHE CANNOT ANSWER QUESTIONS? >>? IN THEORY, YES, BECAUSE SHE BROUGHT ALL OF THIS OUT. IT WOULD BE HARD TO ARGUE THAT AS AN ATTORNEY YOU DON'T GET ACCESS TO MY INVESTIGATION. YOU GO INTO YOUR OWN INVESTIGATION BUT SOMETIMES YOU CAN WAIVE THAT. A GOOD EXAMPLE WOULD BE IF YOU INTRODUCE YOUR LEGISLATION INTO THE RECORD. THIS IS AN INTERESTING TOPIC, BECAUSE IT IS GENERALLY A GOOD IDEA TO HIRE AN INVESTIGATOR TO DO THIS KIND OF WORK. BECAUSE YOU AVOID THAT AWKWARD SITUATION WHERE YOU AND YOUR ATTORNEY ARE SAYING: REMEMBER WHEN I SHOWED YOU THIS. YOU WANT TO AVOID A SITUATION WHERE THE ATTORNEY IS TESTIFYING BUT STILL NOTHING WRONG WITH WHAT MERCHANT DID. SHE HAS AN INTEREST IN GETTING THIS INFORMATION OUT. >>. HOW LONG CAN THEY TAKE IN THIS INVESTIGATION? >>. GEORGIA'S LEGISLATURE IS A LOT LIKE CONGRESS. THEY HOLD INVESTIGATIVE HEARINGS BUT THERE REALLY ISN'T ANY CRIMINAL OR CIVIL CONSEQUENCES. THERE ARE IF YOU REFUSE TO SHOW UP AND YOU ARE SUBPOENAED BUT IT IS MOSTLY A FACT-FINDING MISSION, ANYTHING UPON WHICH LEGISLATION MAY BE HAD. SO THESE HEARINGS ARE NOT AT ALL CRIMINAL IN NATURE. THEY ARE NOT CONSEQUENCES FOR THE FULTON COUNTY CASE ITSELF- NO SUBSTANCE OF CONSEQUENCES BUT OBVIOUSLY THEY WOULD HAVE MAJOR REPUTATIONAL CONSEQUENCES IF MORE INFORMATION COMES OUT THAT WE COULD NOT HERE BECAUSE OF THE RULES OF EVIDENCE >>. THIS COMMITTEE SAYS IT WILL INVESTIGATE FOR AS LONG AS IT TAKES OUR INDICATIONS ARE THAT IT COULD TAKE A WHILE. IS IT POSSIBLE THIS COULD IMPACT THE ELECTION INTERFERENCE AGAINST TRUMP >>. IF INFORMATION COMES OUT IN THE HEARING, THAT COMES BACK TO THIS DISQUALIFICATION HEARING AND McAFEE. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS OR IF IT WILL BE REOPENED BY GEORGE McAFEE. IT MIGHT NOT HAVE THAT MUCH OF AN EFFECT. YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT THIS DISQUALIFICATION IN FANI WILLIS'S AND THE STATE HAS MADE THAT ARGUMENT, AND THEY ARE RIGHT. WHAT REALLY HAPPENS IS IF FANI WILLIS IS DISQUALIFIED, THEN YOU HAVE A PROBLEM OF WHO IS GOING TO TAKE UP THE PROSECUTION FOR HER. BUT NOTHING IS EFFECTIVE OF THE SUBSTANCE OF GUILT OF THE DEFENDANTS, GUILT OR INNOCENCE >>. WE ARE STILL WAITING TO SEE IF SHE COULD BE DISQUALIFIED >>. DEPENDING ON WHETHER OR NOT, THE JUDGE REOPENS THE HEARING WHICH HE MIGHT, WE REALLY DON'T KNOW. >>>. INTERNATIONAL NEWS: HAITI'S PRIME MINISTER IS IN PUERTO RICO THIS MORNING. >>>. CLAUDIO JOINS US NOW. GOOD >>>. CLAUDIO JOINS US NOW, GOOD MORNING. >>. Reporter. ACCORDING TO MEDIA, THE PRIME MINISTER WAS FORCED TO LAND. AFTER HE WAS NOT ALLOWED TO RETURN TO HIS OWN COUNTRY FOR THE PAST FEW DAYS. THE PRIME MINISTER. UPON RETURN TO HAITI, ARMED GANGS TRIED TO TAKE OVER THE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT TO STOP HIM FROM LANDING, DEMANDING THAT THE PRIME, DEMANDING THAT THE PRIME MINISTER SEND DOWN. --. VIOLENCE IN HAITI SPIRALED OUT OF CONTROL, LEADING TO A MASSIVE JAILBREAK. LET'S GO TO INDIA, WHERE THOUSANDS OF FARMERS DEMAND MINIMUM PRICE GUARANTEES FOR MINIMUM PRICE GUARANTEES FOR THEIR CROPS. PROTESTS WERE SUSPENDED AFTER A YOUNG FARMER DIED DURING THAT PROTEST. PREVENTED FROM ENTERING THE BORDERS, THEY HAVE BEEN HEAVILY BARRICADED. THE FARMERS ALSO LOOKING FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO WAIVE THEIR DEBT. >>>. AND PARIS, WHERE THE GOVERNMENT -- INITIALLY ORGANIZERS, ALLOWING FREE ACCESS TO AS MANY AS 600,000 PEOPLE WHO WATCH THE OPENING CEREMONY ALONG THE BANKS OF THE RIVER. ALONG THE BANKS OF THE RIVER, THAMES, 300,000, MORE THAN 100,000 WILL BE PAYING TICKET HOLDERS. NONE OF THE 200,000 WILL WATCH FROM THE UPPER THANKS, BUT BY FROM THE UPPER THANKS, BUT BY INVITATION ONLY. >>> AN EXPLOSION IN A MICHIGAN BUILDING. WHAT INVESTIGATORS FOUND INSIDE? >>> TOO MUCH SCREEN TIME. WHAT INTELLIGENCE? THIS IS WHAT MY VOICE SOUNDS. THIS IS WHAT MY VOICE SOUNDS LIKE WHEN I CLONED IT. >>>. WE HAVE THE LATEST INFORMATION ON THAT MASSIVE EXPLOSION IN MICHIGAN THAT LEFT ONE PERSON DEAD. AN INVESTIGATION IS UNDERWAY TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THE FIRE: ILLEGALLY STORING FLAMMABLE MATERIALS >>. Reporter. MASSIVE EXPLOSIONS LIGHTING UP THE SKY IN MICHIGAN, CAUSING A MASSIVE FACTORY FIRE AT AN INDUSTRIAL SITE ABOUT 25 MILES OUTSIDE OF DETROIT. >> WE HAVE A LOT OF DEBRIS IN THE AIR. >>. Reporter. AUTHORITIES SAY THE PLANT DISTRIBUTES PAPER, PRODUCTS AND OTHER ITEMS IN THE CLINTON TOWNSHIP, PROJECTED INTO THE AIR AND TRAVELING AS FAR AS A MILE AWAY. AS CANISTERS BECAME PROJECTILES, RESIDENTS WERE ASKED TO AVOID THE AREA, STAY INSIDE AND CLOSE THE WINDOWS. NEIGHBORS DESCRIBED HEARING A LOUD BANG WHICH SOUNDED LIKE FIREWORKS SHAKING THE GROUND. SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS SHOWING IMAGES OF HUGE PLUMES OF FIRE AND SMOKE, BILLOWING THE TOWNSHIP RELEASING A STATEMENT SAYING QUOTE UPON ARRIVAL. OFFICERS OBSERVED MATERIAL FLYING IN ALL DIRECTIONS FROM THE BUILDING POLICE, ALSO WRITING ON FACEBOOK: PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, STAY INSIDE. >>. THEY ARE ATTENDING THE FIRE, BUT WHAT IS GOING ON WITH AIR QUALITY? >>. Reporter. WORKERS ARE WORKING TO PUT OUT THE FLAMES. INVESTIGATORS SAY THEY WERE ABLE TO COLLECT DEBRIS THAT LANDED AS FAR AS TWO MILES AWAY FROM HERE. THEY ARE QUALITY AND WATER IS SAFE. BUT THERE IS A WARNING FOR RESIDENTS: IF THEY SEE ANY OF THOSE CANISTERS, DO NOT PICK THEM UP, BECAUSE THEY COULD CONTAIN GAS WHICH COULD EXPLODE. BACK TO YOU: >>> TIME NOW FOR OUR WEEKLY MEDICAL CHECK, A CLOSER LOOK AT HOW MUCH EXERCISE YOU NEED TO LOWER YOUR RISK OF STROKE. >>> MORE SCREEN TIME COULD BE IMPACTING HUNGER COMMUNICATES. >>> OUR MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR TO BREAK DOWN THESE HEADLINES. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. WHAT MORE CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT EXERCISE REDUCING THE RISK FOR STROKE? HOW ARE THEY CONNECTED? >>. WE HAVE ALWAYS KNOWN THAT SOME PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IS BETTER THAN NO PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND NOW WE HAVE AN ANALYSIS. THIS IS CONSIDERED- THE STUDY OF STUDIES, THE STUDY OF STUDIES ABOUT 15, TO LOOK AT SOMETIMES MONITORED LEVELS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND ASSOCIATE IT WITH LEVELS OR RISK OF STROKE. SOME PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IS PROVING BETTER THAN NONE, AND IT SHOWS THAT LOWER LEVELS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE HIGH-INTENSITY AEROBICS OR RUNNING OR BIKING. IF THAT IS YOUR SPORT OF CHOICE, THAT IS GREAT. BUT WHEN YOU GET YOUR HEART RATE SYSTEM JUST A LITTLE HIGHER, WOULD LIKELY TO LEAD TO STROKE COMPARED TO DOING NOTHING AT ALL. THIS HAS FOLLOWED FOR MANY YEARS. THIS IS, I THINK, IMPORTANT FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS. THE DOCTOR'S ORDERS ARE NOT TO BE A SPECTATOR BUT TO TRY TO MAKE MOVEMENT EASIER, AND YOU DON'T NEED TO OVERTHINK IT. HERE ARE SOME TIPS THAT I HAVE PERSONALLY DONE. WHEN YOU ARE PARKING AT A GROCERY STORE, LOOK FOR THE PHASE THAT IS FARTHEST AWAY. IT MIGHT BE KIND OF PAINFUL BUT IT ADDS 1000 STEPS OR MORE, DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU PARK. TAKE A STEP EARLIER AND WALK TO WHEREVER YOU ARE TRYING TO GO. IF YOU ARE MEETING A FRIEND AND TAKE A WALK AND PUSHING AWAY- I AM GUILTY OF THIS MYSELF- PUSH THAT THING AWAY AND WALK OUTSIDE. STUDIES SHOW: IF YOU GO OUTSIDE EVEN FOR 10 SECONDS, YOU ARE MORE LIKELY TO TAKE MORE STEPS THAT DAY >>>. WE HAVE ANOTHER REASON TO PUT SCREENS DOWN, AND THIS HAS TO DO WITH OUR LITTLE ONES. THIS COULD BE IMPACTING YOUR TODDLER'S SPEECH. WHAT IS THE IMPACT AND WHAT IS THE TIME AGE? HOW LONG? >> THE GENERAL RULE OF THUMB UNDER THE AGE OF TWO. THERE IS A RECOMMENDATION FOR NO SCREEN TIME. I HAVE BEEN THERE, WE HAVE ALL BEEN THERE. WHERE YOU HAVE CHILDREN, AND ESPECIALLY DURING COVID, THEY HAVE A LOT MORE SCREEN TIME. THEY LOOKED AT 220 FAMILIES AND 12 MONTHS TO 36 MONTHS IN THAT TIME PERIOD, WHERE THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS RECOMMENDS NO SCREEN TIME OR SEVERELY LIMITED SCREEN TIME. AND HERE IS WHAT IS REALLY STARTLING. WE KNOW THAT SCREEN TIME IS THAT FOR A REASON BUT WE HAVE NOT HAD A STUDY THAT CORRELATES- AND I THINK THIS IS WHAT LISTENERS AND VIEWERS NEED TO UNDERSTAND- FOR EVERY MINUTE OF SCREEN TIME- 12 TO 36 MONTHS OLD- THAT AFFECTS THEM AS THEY GET OLDER AND THEY ACTUALLY LOST SOME OF THEIR SPEECH AND HAD FEWER ADULT WORDS THEY WERE USING. THEY SPOKE FEWER VOCALIZATIONS, BEING ABLE TO SAY A FULL SENTENCE AS YOU, AND SCREEN TIME THEY HAVE LESS ABILITY TO DO THAT AND I THINK WHAT IS REALLY TROUBLING. THEY ENGAGE IN FEWER CONVERSATIONS. DOCTORS HAVE A PLAN TO KNOW. DOCTORS HAVE A PLAN TO KNOW YOUR THREE M'S, KNOW YOUR SCREEN TIME, MODELED YOUR SCREEN TIME AND MANAGE A MEANINGFUL INTERACTION, MEANING TALK ABOUT ANYTIME YOU USE THE SCREEN WHAT THEY ARE LISTENING TO. I AM GUILTY OF IT TOO CONSTANTLY. NO JUDGMENT, BUT IT DOES MATTER >>>. A NEW STUDY FROM THE JOURNAL SAYS: WEARING MAKEUP WHILE EXERCISING CAN HAVE SOME NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON YOUR SKIN. I GUESS THAT IS NOT SUPER SURPRISING BUT WHAT IS THE RESEARCH TELLING US? >>>. 43 COLLEGE STUDENTS HAD FOUNDATION COVERING HALF OF THEIR FACE. AND HERE IS --. I DON'T THINK IT IS SHOCKING, BUT YOU CAN SAY THAT WEARING MAKEUP IS PROBABLY NOT GREAT BUT ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE DRY SKIN, THEY FIND THAT YOU HAVE LESS MOISTURE, LESS ACTIVITY IN YOUR PORES, AND IT MAY SOUND COUNTERINTUITIVE, BUT THE PORES WERE NOT AS LARGE IN THOSE WHO HAD MAKEUP. A GOOD THING WHEN YOU ARE WEARING MAKEUP AND YOU NEED TO BE ON CAMERA, BUT WHEN YOU'RE WORKING OUT, YOU NEED THAT SWEAT, YOUR SKIN NEEDS TO SWEAT AND SOMETIMES LESS IS MORE, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO MAKEUP >>>. THANK YOU SO MUCH. >>>. LATE FEE: RELEASE CREDIT CARD USERS OF OVERDUE BILLS GETTING A MUCH NEEDED BREAK. >>>. WE HAVE A NEW PLAN ON: >>>. WE HAVE A NEW PLAN ON SAVING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON CREDIT CARD CHARGES. >> CAPPING THE CREDIT CARD LATE FEES AT $8.00.. RIGHT, NOW THEY CAN CHARGE AS MUCH AS 30 BUCKS. THIS WILL SAVE CONSUMERS $10 BILLION >>. HELLO CALEB, WE MISS YOU OVER HERE. THOSE WHO MIGHT BE MAKING THAT LATE PAYMENT: WHAT IS THAT GOING TO MEAN FOR THEM? >> IT MEANS LOWER FEES, AND CREDIT CARD COMPANIES HAVE BEEN CREDIT CARD COMPANIES HAVE BEEN CHARGING FEES FOR YEARS FROM A LOOPHOLE. THAT LIMITED THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT CARD COMPANIES CHARGING. ONLY IF THEY CHARGE $25 ON THE FIRST LATE FEE AND UP TO $41 FOR SUBSEQUENT FEES. ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION, THE FEES ARE ALL THE WAY DOWN TO EIGHT BUCKS CREDIT CARD ISSUERS WITH 1 MILLION OR MORE CUSTOMERS. THAT IS A BIG DEAL. IT WILL SAVE HOUSEHOLDS ABOUT $220 PER YEAR. THAT IS A QUICK TRIP TO THE GROCERY STORE MID-MAY. THEY PASSED A ROLE YESTERDAY. THAT IT WILL TAKE UNTIL MID-MAY. YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT CREDIT CARD COMPANIES DON'T LIKE THIS AT ALL. THOSE HIGHER APR'S ARE IMPACTING THE PROFIT MARGINS OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. >>. CLEARLY, A LOT OF POSITIVES. COULD THERE BE A NEGATIVE. THAT $30 FEE MOTIVATES A LOT OF PEOPLE TO PAY THEIR BILL ON TIME. MAYBE THEY SEE $8.00 AND MAYBE THEY PUT IT OFF AND THEY ARE NOT ON TIME WITH THE PAYMENT. >>. THAT IS THE MORAL HABIT. YOU STILL HAVE MOUNTING CREDIT CARD, DEBT AND INTEREST PAYMENTS. ON TOP OF THAT, YOU STILL HAVE INTEREST PAYMENTS. THOSE ARE 24%. $8.00 IS IN ADDITION TO THAT. SO YOU STILL HAVE LATE CHARGES. THAT WILL REDUCE THE CHARGE. FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IT IS ONLY $8.00 AND NOT $35.00 OR $38.00. >>. WILL WE SEE THESE FEES ELSEWHERE? TO BRIDGE THE GAP ON THE MONEY THEY ARE LOSING. >>. THEY DON'T LIKE THIS ONE BIT. THE AMERICAN BANK ASSOCIATION AND CREDIT CARD COMPANIES SAY THE REDISTRIBUTION THEY WILL HAVE TO REDUCE COMPETITION IN THE MARKET, INCREASE THE COST OF CREDIT AND DENY CREDIT TO SOME PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MAKE UP FOR THOSE CHARGES AND THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO EXTEND CREDIT. THAT SAID CONSUMERS HAVE BEEN PAYING A LOT OF FEES FOR A LOT OF TIME. >>. A NUMBER ONE TIP FOR PEOPLE TRYING TO MANAGE THEIR CREDIT CARD BILLS: >> PAY OFF THAT DEBT FIRST, BECAUSE THAT IS EATING AWAY AT YOUR FUTURE RETURNS. YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PAY YOURSELF IN THE FUTURE. PAY THE HIGH INTEREST STUFF FIRST AND GET IT DOWN. >>> MORE FINANCIAL HEADLINES >>. THAT AND MORE MONEY NEWS >>. Reporter.

IN THE FALL LAST NIGHT, TRUMP HELD A VICTOR PARTY AT HIS CLUB, ENFLORIDA GARRETT HAAKE HAS A RECAP OF THE BIG NIGHT. >> NIKKI HALEY'S DECISION TO SUSPEND HER CAMPAIGN ENDS TH REPUBLICAN PRIMARY BUT I DOESN'T HEAL THE RIFF IN THE GOP. HALEY HAS NO PLANS T IMMEDIATELY ENDORSE HER FORMER BOSS WHO, AFTER HIS BIG SUPER TUESDAY NIGHT, WILL TURN HI ATTENTION TO A REMATCH WIT PRESIDENT BIDEN. >> Reporter. THIS MORNING NIKKI HALEY IS SUSPENDING HE CAMPAIGN LEAVING TRUMP, THE ONLY ONE IN THE GOP FIELD HEADED T A REMATCH WITH PRESIDENT BIDEN. HALEY SET TO END HER BID ACCORDING TO A SOURCE WITH DIRECT KNOWLEDGE OF TH DECISION, NBC NEWS LEARNING THAT TRUMP'S FORMER UN AMBASSADOR WILL NO ENDORSE THE FORMER PRESIDENT THIS MORNING. IN THE END, THE REPUBLICAN ELECTORATE IS OVERWHELMINGLY UNITED BEHIND TRUMP. >> THEY CALL IT SUPER TUESDA FOR A REASON. >> Reporter. RACKING UP PRIMAR WINS FROM CALIFORNIA TO MAINE. THE FORMER PRESIDENT MADE NO MENTION OF NIKKI HALEY, EVEN WHEN PRESSED. >> PRESIDENT TRUMP ANY MESSAG FOR NIKKI HALEY? >> Reporter. INSTEAD HE URGE THE GOP TO COME TOGETHER AHEAD OF A POTENTIAL REMATCH WIT PRESIDENT BIDEN THIS FALL. >>. WE HAVE A GREAT REPUBLICA PARTY WITH TREMENDOUS TALENT. WE WANT TO HAVE UNITY AND WE ARE GOING TOHAVE UNITY >>. Reporter. HIS VICTORY I, FUELLED BY OVERWHELMING SUPPOR FROM THE REPUBLICAN BASE. SOME HALEY SUPPORTERS SAY THEY ARE PREPARED TO VOTE FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN IN A REMATCH WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP. >> IF HE DOESN'T ACCEPT TH OUTCOME OF THE LAST ELECTION, THEN HE CAN'T GET AHEAD OF IT. >>. Reporter. PRESIDENT BIDEN CRUISED TO VICTORY AHEAD OF GENERAL ELECTION THAT COULD BE DECIDED BY NARROW MARGINS BUT HE IS FACING ANGRY VOTERS I MICHIGAN WHERE THEY PROTESTE THE GAZA WAR. HE REACHED OUT TO VOTERS LAS NIGHT SAYING TRUMP IS FOCUSED ON REVENGE AND RETRIBUTION AND NO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. FROM SUPER TUESDAY TO STATE OF THE UNION THURSDAY. IF LAS NIGHT'S WAS DONALD TRUMP'S GENERAL ELECTION KICKOFF. LOOK FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN TO OUTLINE THE CHOICE FOR VOTERS TOMORROW NIGHT IN HIS STATE OF THE UNIO ADDRESS. NOW THAT HIS OPPONEN FOR NOVEMBER IS KNOWN. >> WE ARE JOINED IN STUDIO B ANALYST CHUCK TODD GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US >> ABSOLUTELY. >>. FIRST OF ALL REACTION TO NIKKI HALEY. WE ARE EXPECTING HER TO DROP OUT AND THE OTHER BIG TAKE AWAYS. >> LOOK. ACCORDING TO SOURCES WE HAVE CONTACTED HERE, HOW SHE WILL EXIT IS WHAT I WOUL EXPECT. DON'T ENDORS IMMEDIATELY. MAYBE SHE DOESN'T EVER. MAYBE SHE SAYS SHE WILL VOTE FOR THE NOMINEE, WHATEVER IT IS. I DON'T THIN. SHE CAN GO RIGHT BACK TO TRUMP WORLD IF SHE WANTS ANY CREDIBILITY OR IF SHE WANTS FUTURE. SHE IS SORT OF INVESTED IN TRUMP LOSING BECAUSE, THEN SHE CAN BE AN. I TOLD YOU SO REPUBLICAN. I TOLD YOU HE COULDN'T WIN THE GENERAL ELECTION, SO IT WILL BE AWKWARD TO SEE WHAT SHE IS DOING. THE OTHER THING THAT WE OUGHT TO BE LOOKING AT IN THESE REPUBLICAN PRIMARIES IS: I'M NO CONVINCED. THE HALEY VOTERS VOTED FOR TRUMP IN 2020.. I THINK THESE ARE VERY MOTIVATED ANTI-TRUMP VOTERS. IF YOU ARE THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN, YOU LOOK AT THEM AS NEW VOTERS BUT AT LEAST YOU KNOW THOS FOLKS ARE SHOWING UP. THEY SHOWED UP AT A PRIMARY THAT THEY KNEW THEY WOULD LOSE, SO THEY WILL SHOW UP IN TH GENERAL ELECTION. >> GOOD POINT, LET'S PUT A PIN IN NIKKI THI MORNING NOW THAT WE HAVE THE APPAREN NOMINATION. DO YOU SEE MORE OF THE PARTY COALESING BEHIND THE FORMER PRESIDENT? >> WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN IT. IT IS REALLY ONLY NIKKI HALE AND MITCH McCONNELL WHO HAVE NOT ENDORSED HIM THE NEXT SIX WEEKS. JOE BIDEN HAS A REAL ADVANTAGE, A HUGE FINANCIAL ADVANTAGE. TRUMP HAS PERSONAL LEGAL FINANCIAL ISSUES. THE CAMPAIGN HAS ISSUES, SO TRUMP WILL GO ON FUNDRAISING SPREE. THIS IS VERY NORMAL. A NOMINEE HAS TO SPEND ALL O THIS MONEY AND HE HAS TO CATCH UP. BIDEN HAS A CHANCE TO PRESS TH FINANCIAL ADVANTAGE. WHAT IS INTERESTING TO LEARN I? WHAT ARE THE PAIN POINTS THA? THEY THINK YOU KNOW. EVERYTHIN NEGATIVE ABOUT TRUMP IS XOEN BUT WHAT DO THEY THINK I NECESSARY TO REPEAT? THAT IS WHAT LOOKING AT NEXT >>. PRESIDENT BIDEN DIDN'T REALLY HAVE ANY COMPETITION. WHAT IS THE TAKE AWAY OF HIS PERFORMANCE LAST NIGHT >>? I THINK WE OUGHT TO PUT T BED. THE PEOPLE WHO AR HAMMERING ABOUT PRESIDENT BIDE ARE PEOPLE WHO USED TO WORK FO BARACK, OBAMA AND IN WASHINGTON DC. IF DEMOCRATIC VOTERS DIDN'T WANT JOE BIDEN AS THE NOMINEE, THEY HAD PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITY TO SAY: BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT HAPPENED. I THINK JOE BIDEN HAD A STRONGER PRIMARY PERFORMANCE THAN I EXPECTED. SO YOU LOOK AT THE POLLS AND THE BASIS. THERE IS STILL A STRONG ANTI-TRUMP COALITION OUT THERE AND IT SHOULD PUT TO REST. -- DEMOCRATS MAY WISH THEY HAD YOUNGER NOMINEE, BUT YOU CAN SE THEIR ACCEPTANCE >>. ALL RIGHT, STAY TUNED, SIT THERE, BECAUSE WE WILL, AS YOU, A FEW MORE QUESTIONS IN MOMENT >>. BUT FIRST WOEL TURN TO OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, STEV KORNACKI, WHO IS AT THE BIG BOARD GOOD MORNING WALK, US THROUGH TRUMP'S VICTOR LAST NIGHT AND HOW HE PERFORMED AGAINST EXPECTATIONS >>. YEAH, IF YOUR EXPECTATION WERE BASED ON THE EARL PRIMARIES WE SAW IN NE HAMPSHIRE, SOUTH CAROLINA, SOUTH CAROLINA, HER HOME STATE- SHE GO 40% OF THE VOTE. IF THOSE WERE YOUR EXPECTATION IN TERMS OF THE NONTRUMP VOTE, THEN TRUMP EXCEEDED THEM. TAKE A LOOK HERE. I HAVE A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES, STARTING WITH VIRGINIA. VIRGINIA, JUST DEMOGRAPHICALLY, IT BIG SUBURBS OUTSIDE O WASHINGTON DC AROUND RICHMOND. THERE IS A LOT OF DEMOGRAPHICS IN VIRGINIA THAT WOULD BE VERY FAVORABLE TO NIKKI HALEY, BASED ON WHERE SHE WAS PERFORMING WELL- IN SOUTH CAROLINA AND IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. BUT ONLY 35% OF THE VOTE FOR HER IN VIRGINIA AND THE DEMOGRAPHIC PROFILE WA MORE FAVORABLE TO HER THAN I SOUTH CAROLINA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE. SO TOONLY GET 35% HERE. SOME O THE ENERGY THAT WAS BEHIND HER EARLY IN THE CONTESTS SEEMS TO HAVE DISSIPATED LAST NIGHT. LOOK AT NORTH CAROLINA TOO: THERE WAS NO EXPECTATION. THA HALEY WAS GOING TO WIN NORTH CAROLINA BUT AROUND THE TRIANGLE AND TH CHARLOTTE METRO AREA, THERE WERE A LOT OF AREAS ON PAPER WHER HALEY COULD HAVE MADE A LEAD BUT INSTEAD SHE LOSES BY 50%. LOOK AT THE MARGIN IN TEXAS: 6 POINTS. IT WASN'T THAT NIKKI HALEY HAD A CHANCE TO WIN THE STATE. BUT ON THING WE WERE LOOKING AT I, TEXAS HAS 38 CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS AROUND THE STATE. THEY GIVE OUT DELEGATES ON CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS. THERE WERE DISTRICTS IN TH METRO AREA AROUND HOUSTON, METROPLEX, AUSTIN- AGAIN O PAPER. GEMOGRAPHICALLY. YOU LOOK AT THEM AND THINK: IF HALEY WAS GETTING 40% IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, SHE CAN MAYBE WIN THOS DISTRICTS, BUT SHE IS NOT EVEN CLOSE. LOOK AT TRAVIS COUNTY, ONE O THE MOST LIBERAL COUNTIES IN TEXAS, AND TRUMP IS BEATING HALEY BY 24 POINTS. SO THERE WAS AN ENERGY BEHIN HER. IN EARLIER CONTESTS THAT REFLECTED REPUBLICANS OPEN T HER, BUT THEY ARE CONCLUDING THAT TRUMP'S GOT IT AND THEY AR GETTING ON BOARD. THE DEMOCRATS AND INDEPENDENTS WERE DONE WITH THAT. THOSE ARE SOME OF THE FACTOR THAT MAY HAVE BEEN IN PLAY. >>. WHAT DOES SUPER TUESDAY TEL US ABOUT WHERE TRUMP I VULNERABLE WHEN IT COMES TO GENERAL ELECTION? >>. BEYOND SUPER TUESDAY, HE IS VULNERABLE IN VERMONT, BUT WE KNOW HE IS NOT GOING TO WI VERMONT IN NOVEMBER. THE ONLY REAL POTENTIAL SWIN STATE YOU SAW LAST NIGHT WAS NORTH CAROLINA. NOW, NORTH CAROLINA WAS A TRUMP STATE BY 87,000 VOTES IN 2020, DOWN A BIT FROM 2016 PUT. THIS IS PROBABLY STILL A REACH FOR DEMOCRATS IF THEY WILL MAKE RUN FOR NORTH CAROLINA. IT IS HARD TO LOOK AT THES RESULTS. THERE ARE AREAS HERE YOU WOULD HAVE LOOKED AT, PARTICULARLY AROUND CHARLOTTE- OUTSIDE OF CHARLOTTE, UNION COUNTY- A BIG BEDROOM COUNTY, REPUBLICAN. BUT AGAIN, IT IS SUBURBAN IN NATURE AND THEN YOU THOUGHT MAYBE HALEY WOULD MAKE A GOOD NUMBER FOR TRUMP IN UNION COUNTY. SO I DON'T THINK YOU CAN SEE I ON THE MAP, BUT WE KNOW FROM NINE YEARS THAT TRUMP'S PROBLEM IS IN THE SUBURBS. >> GREAT TO TALK TO YOU ON THI WEDNESDAY. >>. CHUCK, LET'S BRING YOU BACK IN HERE. YOU MENTIONED THE NEXT SIX WEEKS ARE CRITICAL AND YOU WROTE A PIECE ABOUT IT. IS IT JUST ABOUT THE MONEY? WE HAVE EIGHT FULL MONTHS HERE. WHAT COULD WE SEE HAPPEN IN TH NEXT FEW WEEKS? >>. I THINK, BECAUSE THERE ARE A FEW THINGS THAT WILL B HAPPENING HERE FOR BIDEN. THA ARE OPPORTUNITY AND POTENTIA RISKS. THE STATE OF THE UNION TO B FRANK PERFORMANCE MATTERS HERE. STYLE POINTS MATTER. PEOPLE HATE HEARING THAT, BUT I THIS CASE PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT. IF HE CAN PERFORM. IT MAY BE UNFAIR, BUT THAT'S WHAT TELEVISION DID. HE HAS TO PERFORM. WE SAW HIM DO IT A YEAR AGO. IT IS NOT AS IF THIS ISN'T I HIS WHEEL HOUSE. YOU HAVE THE POTENTIAL TESTIMONY OF THE SPECIAL COUNSEL HUR WHAT HE SAID IN RELEASING THE TRANSCRIPTS. THESE WILL BE UNCOMFORTABLE MOMENTS. WHAT WE WILL FIND OUT IS THINK. THE BIGGEST CHALLENG BIDEN AND TRUMP HAVE IS WHAT DOES THE DAY AFTER LOOK LIKE? HOW ARE YOU -- DO YOU CREDIBLY MAKE THE CASE THAT YOU WIL BRING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER? WILL YOU BOW ABLE TO KNI EVERYTHING TOGETHER? BIDEN REALLY HAD THAT MESSAG FOUR YEARS AGO. IT IS HARDER MESSAGE AS AN INCUMBENT TO MAKE HERE. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I'M WATCHING. WHAT IS HIS BRING TH COUNTRY TOGETHER MESSAGE? I THINK THERE IS A SMALL SLICE OF UNDECISIVE VOTERS. >>. GREAT TO HAVE YOU >>>. LAWYERS FOR TRUMP AR SEEKING A NEW TRIAL IN THE E JEAN CARROLL DEFAMATION CASE. THE ATTORNEYS FILED A MOTION I A NEW YORK COURT YESTERDAY. THEY ARE ARGUING IT WA PREJUDICIAL TO EXCLUDE PART OF TRUMP'S TESTIMONY ON HIS STATE OF MIND WHEN HE MADE COMMENT ABOUT CARROLL. A JURY FOUND HE MUST PAY $83 MILLION FOR DEFAMING HER. HER ATTORNEYS HAVE DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THE FILING >>>. WE ARE FOLLOWING THE MASSIVE AND DEADLY EXPLOSION THAT ROCKED A DISTRIBUTION CENTER OUTSIDE OF DETROIT MONDAY NIGHT. INVESTIGATORS ARE WORKING TO FIND OUT WHAT CAUSED THE BLAST THAT LED TO THE DEATH OF A TEENAGER AND ONE INJURED. FIREFIGHTER ADRIENNE BROADDUS IS JOINING U NOW WITH MORE. >>. Reporter. GOOD MORNING TO YOU. DAYLIGHT IS PROVIDING SOME ASSISTANCE. ALL THAT IS LEFT IS THE SEEN THAT ONCE IDENTIFIED THE BUILDING DESTROYED IN THE FIRE. POLICE HAVE QUESTIONED EMPLOYEES WHO WERE INSIDE BUT MANAGED TO ESCAPE. INVESTIGATORS WANT TO KNOW WHA THEY HEARD AND WHAT THEY SAW. THIS MORNING FIRE INVESTIGATORS ARE EXPECTED TO RETURN TO TH SCENE. THERE ARE SOME BIG KEY QUESTIONS. THIS MORNING, INVESTIGATORS ARE TRYING TO DETERMINE WHAT STARTED BURNING THE FIRE OR EXPLOSION. THE BUILDING SHARED BY A SMOKE SHOP AND DISTRIBUTORS WHO SUPPLY VAPE PRODUCTS. AUTHORITIES SAY IT WAS SUPPOSE TO BE A RETAIL OPERATION. INSTEAD INSIDE THE ROOM WAS A PALLET OF NITROUS OXIDE, AN LIGHTER FLUID. THE BUSINESS JUST RECEIVED A SEMI LOAD OF BUTANE CANISTERS, HALF REMAINED. >>. THEY WERE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE THE CANISTERS. >>. Reporter. THAT'S NOT ALL. >>. THERE WERE OVER 100,000 VAP PENS THAT OBVIOUSLY HAD LITHIU BATTERIES INSIDE. >>. Reporter. RESIDENTS I CLINTON TOWNSHIP THOUGHT THE WERE UNDER ATTACK. >> YOI KNOW IF WE WERE AT WAR. >>. Reporter. THE BLAST SCATTERED DEBRIS AS FAR AS TWO MILES AWAY. >>. WE HAVE A LOT OF DEBRIS I THE AIR. >>. Reporter. CANISTERS CONTAINING BUTANE, NITROUS OXIDE AND OTHER GAS LAUNCHED INTO TH SKY ONE FIREFIGHTER INJURED WHEN SHRAPNEL BROKE THE WINDSHIELD OF HIS VEHICLE. A 19-YEAR-OLD MALE AWAY FROM THE BUILDING DIED FROM A HEA INJURY >>. THE PERSON WAS ESSENTIALL ABOUT A QUARTER MILE DOWN TH ROAD HERE AND DID SUFFER INJURIES FROM THE FLYING CANISTER >>. Reporter. THE BUSINESS OWNERS ARE COOPERATING WITH AUTHORITIES BUT HAVE NOT RESPONDED TO CALL FROM NBC NEWS. FIRE CHIEF DUNCAN HAS SEEN A LOT BUT THIS IS A FIRST. >>. I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS IN MY 25 YEARS. >>. Reporter. MORE THAN 24 HOUR LATER, THERE ARE STILL HOT SPOTS BURNING. WE HAVE SEEN FLAMES OVERNIGH AND EVEN THIS MORNING A BIG WARNING FOR RESIDENT HERE: THE CANISTERS FLYING THROUGH THE AIR. WE KNOW THEY LANDED AND SCATTERED TWO MILES AWAY. IF ANYONE SEES THEM IN THEIR YARD OR ON THE SIDEWALKS, DO NOT PICK THEM UP. INVESTIGATORS SAY THEY COULD STILL EXPLODE. >>. ALL RIGHT, IMPORTAN INFORMATION, THANK YOU. >>>. IN CAIRO THIS MORNING, EFFORTS ARE INTENSIFYING T REACH, A CEASE FIRE AGREEMENT I GAZA BEFORE THE START OF RAMADAN, AS TALKS ENDED WITHOUT A BREAK THROUGH THE SIX WEEK DEAL WOULD SEE TH RELEASE OF SOME ISRAELI HOSTAGES AND PALESTINIAN PRISONERS AND AN INCREASE IN AID TO GAZA' STARVING POPULATION. JOINING US IS THE MIDDLE EAS DIRECTOR OF THE INTERNATIONA COMMUNITIES ORGANIZATION. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US FIRST. WHAT IS YOUR ASSESSMENT OF WHERE WE ARE AT WITH TH CEASE FIRE, HOSTAGE TALKS AND HOW IMPORTANT IS IT TO GET A DEA DONE SOON? >>. IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT T GET A DEAL DONE SOON. I WISH I COULD BE OPTIMISTIC, BUT I'M NOT. THEY ARE FOCUSED ON ONE OF THEIR DEMANDS ON ISRAEL WHICH IS WAY BEYOND WHAT THE NETANYAH GOVERNMENT CAN EXPECT TO AGREE TO, INCLUDING THE BIGGEST NAMES OF THE ISRAELI MURDERS EXPECTE TO BE RELEASED TO END THE WAR. WITHDRAW FROM GAZA TALKS WERE OF A SIX WEEK CEASE FIRE WITHOUT THE ISRAELI OBLIGATION TO END THE WAR, BUT IT SEEMS THAT HAMAS IS BACK TRACKING. IT IS NOT COMPLETELY CLEAR WHY THEY ARE DOING THIS. THEY NEED A CEASE FIRE AS MUCH AS ISRAEL DOES- EVEN MORE THAN ISRAEL DOES, AND RAMADAN IS FOUR DAYS AWAY. >>. YOU WROTE A COLUMN YESTERDA FOR THE TIMES OF ISRAEL IN WHICH YOU OUTLINED A POSSIBL DIPLOMATIC WAY OF ENDING THE WAR. YOU SAID THAT THE UNITED STATE AND OTHERS SHOULD RECOGNIZE PALESTINIAN STATE AND REMOVE ISRAEL'S VETO. HOW HARD WOULD THAT BE IN THIS CLIMATE AND EXPLAIN WHY THAT IS SUCH A IMPORTANT STEP? >>. ISRAEL CAN DEFEAT HAMAS MILITARILY AND PREVENT HAMAS FROM GOVERNING THE GAZA STRIP, BUT ISRAEL CANNOT DEFEAT THE IDEA THAT ISRAEL HIT THE STRIP AND KILLED PALESTINIANS, THE MORE ISRAEL STAYS THE MOR. THE STRENGTH OF THE INSURGEANC AGAINST THE ISRAELI ARMY. HAMAS SAYS: FREEDOM FOR THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE IN EXCHANGE FOR ISRAELI SECURITIES. 139 COUNTRIES HAVE RECOGNIZE THE STATE OF PALESTINE. ABOUT 160 COUNTRIES HAVE RECOGNIZED THE STATE OF ISRAEL. WE NEED ALL MEMBERS OF THE UNITED NATIONS TO RECOGNIZE BOTH STATES IN ORDER TO DEMONSTRATE TO THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE, AN THE ISRAELI PEOPLE, THAT TH INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS SERIOUS ABOUT PEACE. WE HAVE A 30 YEAR PEACE PROCES CALLING FOR A TWO STAT SOLUTIONS, WHERE MOST COUNTRIES, THE BIG COUNTRIES, HAVE ONLY RECOGNIZED ISRAEL. IA NEED TO MAKE PALESTINE REAL FOR PALESTINIANS AND GIV ASSURANCES TO ISRAEL THAT THEY WILL HAVE SECURITY >>. OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS, W HAVE SEEN A SHIFT IN TONE FROM THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION TOWARDS ISRAEL. WE HAD VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS CRITICIZING ISRAEL OVER WHAT I NOW THIS TOTAL HUMANITARIA CATASTROPHE IN GAZA. WE ARE ALSO SEEING PRESSUR XRTED BY US OFFICIALS TO LET MORE AID IN AS WE KEEP SEEIN THAT STOPPED AT THEBOARDER. WHAT DOES THIS SAY ABOUT THE STATE OF US ISRAELI RELATIONS? >>. I THINK WE ARE FACING THE POSSIBILITY OF ACTION ON THE LEFT: 20% ON THE GAZA STRIP. MILLIONS ARE CROWDED IN LIVING IN TENT CITIES, SOME ARE IN THE STREETS WITHOU HOMES. A LOT OF DEATHS OF INNOCEN CHIRP HAVE TAKEN PLACE OVER TH LAST FIVE MONTHS OF THE WAR. WE STILL HAVE 130 HOSTAGES BEING HELD BY HAMAS. MORE THAN HALF OF THEM ARE BELIEVED TO BE DEAD. I THINK THE UNITED STATES IS SENDING A CLEAR MESSAGE THAT THE WAR NEEDS TO COME TO AN END. WE NEED A CEASE FIRE. RAMADAN IS A VERY SENSITIV MONTH THROUGHOUT THE REGION. I THINK THE UNITED STATES IS CALLING THE SHOTS RIGHT. WE NEED TO PUT PRESSURE ON BOT SIDES TO GET A CEASE FIRE NOW. WHAT I SUGGESTED IN MY ARTICLE IS PERHAPS THE SIX WEEK COOLIN OFF PERIOD COULD. ALLOW MEDIATORS, UNITED STATES AND OTHERS TO COME UP WITH DIPLOMATIC END TO THE WAR, SO W DO NOT NEED TO CONTINU FIGHTING. >> THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THI MORNING. WE APPRECIATE IT. >>. THANK YOU. >>>. LET'S TURN TO WEATHER. NOW YOU GOT TO GRAB THE RAIN BOOTS AGAIN. WE ARE KEEPING AN EYE ON STORM IN THE EAST. >>. ANGIE LASSMAN IS HERE WITH LOOK AHEAD. >> GOOD MORNING. THE UMBRELLA RAIN BOOTS YO HAVE TO HAVE IT ALL. TODAY WE WILL SEE PLENTY OF RAIN I THE EAST. WE HAVE POISTURE FROM THE SOUT THAT WILL COMBINE WITH THE MOISTURE OVER PORTIONS OF TH OHIO VALLEY. THAT IS LEAVING US WITH A LOT OF RAIN THAT WE WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH OVER THE NEXT DAY OR SO. SATELLITE AND RADAR HAS RAIN MOVING OUT OF ATLANTA. IT IS A SOGGY MORNING THERE.

263,QOHpS66pheQ,This Morningâ€™s Top Headlines â€“ March 6 | Morning News NOW,NBC News,2024-03-06 12:59:20+00:00,"WORKING OUT WHAT A NEW STUDY FOUND ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF SWEATING WITH PRODUCTS ON YOUR SKIN >>>. LET'S GET RIGHT TO THIS BREAKING NEWS. IN THE RACE FOR THE WHITE HOUSE, FORMER UN AMBASSADOR WILL END HER CAMPAIGN. ACCORDING TO KEY SOURCES >>. THE NEWS COMES AFTER MILLIONS OF PEOPLE CAST VOTES ON SUPER TUESDAY WITH A DOMINATING NIGHT FOR DONALD TRUMP. NIKKI HALEY LOST EVERY STATE EXCEPT VERMONT, WHICH WAS ONLY HER SECOND WIN IN 2024.. SHE ALSO CAME OUT ON TOP IN THE DC PRIMARY THIS LAST WEEKEND. DC PRIMARY THIS LAST WEEKEND. SHE HAS SET TO MAKE REMARKS. >>> DONALD TRUMP THINKING, LOOKING FORWARD TO THE GENERAL ELECTION. >>. THEY TELL ME THAT THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ONE LIKE THIS, NEVER BEEN ANYTHING SO CONCLUSIVE. NOVEMBER 5th IS GOING TO BE DOWN AS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT DAY IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. >>> ADAM SCHIFF AND REPUBLICAN STEVE GARVEY WILL ADVANCE TO THE GENERAL ELECTION. IN THE CALIFORNIA SENATE RACE UNDER CALIFORNIA ROLLS, THE TOP TWO VOTE GETTERS ADVANCED TO THE VOTE GETTERS ADVANCED TO THE GENERAL ELECTION. WE HAVE TEAM COVERAGE AHEAD THIS MORNING, RECAPPING SUPER TUESDAY WITH SENIOR POLITICAL MARK MURRAY. LET'S START ON DANIEL ISLAND IN SOUTH CAROLINA. LET'S GET TO THAT BREAKING NEWS ABOUT NIKKI HALEY'S CAMPAIGN. WHAT CAN YOU TELL US? >>. Reporter. GOOD MORNING, BEFORE THE SUN WAS UP IN SOUTH CAROLINA, WE WERE ABLE TO CONFIRM THE NEWS THAT NIKKI HALEY, LATER THIS MORNING, WILL BE ENDING HER BID FOR PRESIDEN. THIS IS AFTER SUPER TUESDAY, WHICH WAS A DIFFICULT NIGHT FOR THE HALEY CAMPAIGN, AND YOU ALSO HAVE TO IMAGINE THAT TRUMP WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE HAD A CLEAN SWEEP OF THESE SUPER TUESDAY STATES. AND THERE IS HALEY. NOTCHING THAT WHEN BACK IN VERMONT. THAT MAKES HALEY THE FIRST WOMAN TO WIN TWO REPUBLICAN PRIMARY CONTEST. INITIALLY, SHE MADE HISTORY BY WINNING THE FIRST ONE IN DC OVER THE WEEKEND EVEN. AS SHE LEAVES THE RACE, LEAVING A LEGACY FOR WOMEN TO COME BEHIND HER BUT FOR HALEY THIS MORNING, I AM TOLD SHE IS NOT LIKELY TO ENDORSE. IN THE SPEECH WE >> HER TO GIVE. AROUND 10:00, IN THE BUILDING BEHIND ME INSTEAD, ONE PERSON PUT IT TO US TO INVITE THE VOTERS, AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE AN UPHILL CLIMB FOR THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE SOME OF THOSE FOLKS SAID THEY WOULD NEVER BE IN THE MARKET FOR TRUMP. >>. WHAT CAN WE >> TO SEE FROM HIM IN THE COMING DAYS? >>. Reporter. CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT THIS IS A PERSON WHO IS NOW SITTING THERE WITH THE NOMINATION WELL IN HAND? HE NO LONGER HAS ANY RIFLE. IT HAS BEEN CLEAR THAT THAT HAS CHAGRINED HIM OVER THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS. HE COULD NOT WAIT TO PIVOT INTO THE GENERAL ELECTION, POSTURE LEADING TO SOME OF THE NAME- CALLING THAT HAS BECOME SO CHARACTERISTIC OF HIM FOCUSING ON HIS ONLY RIVAL, NIKKI HALEY. NIKKI WAS VERY CRITICAL OF THE FORMER PRESIDENT IN THESE WAITINWEEKS, ATTACKING HIM ON EVERYTHING, FROM HIS MORAL FIBER ON THE WORLD STAGE TO HIS MENTAL FITNESS. THOSE ARE ATTACKS AS SHE LEAVES THE RACE. THOSE ARE NOT GOING ANYWHERE BECAUSE SHE PROVIDED A REAL ECHO CHAMBER FOR THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN TO AMPLIFY THE ATTACKS. THE CALL COMING FROM INSIDE THE GOP HOUSE CRITICIZING THE FORMER PRESIDENT- MADE IT LESS PARTY, NONAFFILIATED, AND MUCH MORE WHERE THEY CAN TAKE IT TO THE GENERAL ELECTION AND SAY, NOT JUST DEMOCRATS ARE SAYING THAT STUFF, BUT THE PEOPLE WHO RAN AGAINST HIM AND SERVED IN HIS ADMINISTRATION. AT ONE POINT >> YOU MENTIONED THAT WE DON'T. >> HALEY, TO HAVE AN ENDORSEMENT, WALK US THROUGH THE TIMELINE TO THAT DEBATE STAGE WHERE EVERYONE PUT THEIR HANDS UP, TO WHERE SHE MIGHT BE NOW AND WHAT MIGHT BE GOING ON IN HER HEAD AS SHE TRIES TO FIGURE OUT HER NEXT STEP >>. Reporter. HERE IS THE PROBLEM WITH THE GOP LOYALTY PLEDGE, WHICH IS JUST A PIECE OF PAPER. IT IS NOT BINDING. THERE IS NOTHING THE RNC CAN DO TO ENFORCE IT. AS HALEY POINTED OUT OVER THE WEEKEND, SHE HAD TO SIGN THAT PAGE TO GET ON THE DEBATE STAGE. I WILL ALSO NOTE THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP NEVER SIGNED A PAGE LIKE THAT. TRUMP IN 2016, DURING THE PRIMARY, WHEN I WAS COVERING IT, WAS SAYING THAT HE MIGHT NOT SUPPORT THE NOMINEE IF IT WAS ANYONE OTHER THAN HIM SOUND FAMILIAR. HE NOW HAS THE PARTIES FORCING THEMSELVES TO ASK OTHER CANDIDATES IF THEY WOULD ENDORSE THE PERSON WHO WOULD WIN KNOWING FULL WELL. THE ONLY REASON THEY ARE ASKING IS BECAUSE OF THE GUY THAT IS ULTIMATELY GOING TO WIN THE NOMINATION. SOME REAL CIRCULAR LOGIC AT THE RNC BUT HALEY NOW SAYING: I AM GOOD. SINCE THE PAPER IS NOT BINDING AND THE DEBATE IS OVER, I AM GOING TO DO WHAT I WANT TO DO AND WHAT SHE DOESN'T WANT TO DO IS ENDORSE TRUMP. >>. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US THIS MORNING. >>>. MARK MURRAY, WHAT ARE YOUR BIG TAKEAWAYS FROM LAST NIGHT? >>. Reporter. IT WAS A DOMINANT PERFORMANCE BY DONALD TRUMP ON SUPER TUESDAY. TRUMP ENDED UP WINNING 14 OUT OF THE 15 STATES IN THE CONTEST LAST NIGHT AND HIS ONLY LOSS WAS IN THE VERMONT PRIMARY. HE ENDED UP WINNING 94% OF THE DELEGATES THAT HAVE BEEN AWARDED SO FAR ON SUPER TUESDAY AND AS YOU END UP SEEING NIKKI HALEY'S EXIT FROM THIS CONTEST THIS MORNING, THAT IS ABOUT A 1000 DELEGATE LEAD OVER NIKKI HALEY. NIKKI HALEY ENDED UP TELLING CHRISTIAN WALKER ON MEET THE PRESS THAT SHE WOULD CONTINUE TO STAY IN THE CONTEST AS LONG AS IT REMAINED COMPETITIVE. I THINK WE GOT OUR ANSWER LAST NIGHT >>. AT THIS POINT WE KNOW NIKKI HALEY GOT 20, 30 WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. THESE ARE DEMOCRATS INTERESTED IN HER INDEPENDENCE AND STRESSED IT IN HER. WHO DO YOU THINK IT'S HER VOTE? AS WE MOVE TO THE GENERAL ELECTION >>. Reporter. IT IS GOING TO BE ABOUT HALF AND DONALD TRUMP ENDED UP HAVING A DOMINANT PERFORMANCE AMONG SELF DESCRIBED REPUBLICANS. NIKKI HALEY DID VERY WELL, AS WE HAVE SEEN IN PREVIOUS CONTEST WITH MODERATES AND LIBERALS AS WELL AS POLITICAL INDEPENDENCE BUT THERE IS A CLUE IN THE EXIT POLL THAT WE ENDED UP GETTING LAST NIGHT ABOUT WHO THESE NIKKI HALEY VOTERS ARE IN VIRGINIA. FOR EXAMPLE, WE ENDED UP FINDING 51% OF NIKKI HALEY'S VOTERS APPROVE OF PRESIDENT BIDEN'S JOB PERFORMANCE, VERSUS 47% WHO SAY THEY DISAPPROVE. THAT 50-50 SPLIT IS A GOOD INDICATION ON THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO VOTE FOR JOE BIDEN- WHO MIGHT ALREADY BE JOE BIDEN VOTERS BEFORE THIS PRIMARY SEASON BEGAN. VERSUS, THOSE REPUBLICANS AGAIN ABOUT HALF WHO ARE REPUBLICANS, AND DONALD TRUMP NEEDS TO WIN BACK >>. FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP TALK TO HIS STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES >>. Reporter SAVANNA. AGAIN, THE PATTERN THAT WE ENDED UP SEEING LAST NIGHT WAS THAT HE DID SO WELL AMONG CONSERVATIVES AND REPUBLICANS, PRIMARY VOTER, AND THOSE ARE THE BEDROCK. THOSE ARE THE LETTERS YOU WANT. THOSE ARE THE LETTERS YOU WANT TO DO WELL WITH IN A REPUBLICAN PRIMARY. THEY MAKE UP THE BULK OF THE VOTERS AND, AS HE ENDED UP DOING IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND IOWA AND SOUTH CAROLINA, HE IS DOING VERY WELL LAST NIGHT IN NORTH VIRGINIA AND -- VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA- WHERE HE DID NOT DO THAT WELL IS AMONG MODERATES AND INDEPENDENT. THAT HAS BEEN NIKKI HALEY'S LANE IN THIS RACE. SHE DID VERY WELL AND THAT IS AN INDICATION OF THE WORK HE HAS TO DO AT LEAST WITH HE REPUBLICANS WHO ARE OPEN TO VOTING FOR HIM COME NOVEMBER. >>. WE PIVOT TO THE GENERAL ELECTION. LET'S FOCUS ON PRESIDENT BIDEN. IS THERE ANY CLUE ON HOW HE MIGHT DO IN NOVEMBER? HE DID NOT HAVE A STRONG CHALLENGER LIKE NIKKI HALEY BUT THERE WERE SOME OTHER PEOPLE ON THE BALLOT. WHAT DID WE LEARN? >>. Reporter. I THINK HE IS CRUISING HIS PARTY'S NOMINATION AND HE HAS VERY LITTLE COMPETITION. THERE WERE SOME STATES WHERE HE ENDED UP GETTING ALMOST ALL OF THE VOTES. THERE WAS A CONTEST IN MINNESOTA WHERE HE ENDED UP GETTING 70% AND YOU END UP HAVING UNCOMMITTED HIM GETTING A SIZABLE SHARE OF THAT VOTE AND IN THE CONTEST, LIKE AMERICAN SAMOA, HE ENDED UP LOSING TO A NOAME, TO THE PERSON WHO WE HAVE NEVER EVEN HEARD OF CALLED JASON PALMER LAST NIGHT. INSTANCES OF MINORITY VOTERS. JOE BIDEN HAS CRUISED HIS PARTY'S NOMINATION. THE PARTY HAS DECIDED HE IS GOING TO BE THERE NOMINEE. WE WILL HAVE A GENERAL ELECTION OVER THE NEXT EIGHT MONTHS. >>. MARK MURRAY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >>>. THIS MORNING THERE IS A MAJOR SHAKEUP THAT COULD DETERMINE CONTROL OF THE SENATE. KYRSTEN SINEMA, AN INDEPENDENT, ANNOUNCED SHE IS NOT RUNNING FOR REELECTION. >>. IN A BLISTERING VIDEO SHE POSTED ON ASK TOUTING HER ACCOMPLISHMENTS. WELL, SHE WAS IN OFFICE BEFORE BLAMING HER DECISION NOT TO RUN AGAIN. ON THE CURRENT TOXIC POLITICAL, THE CURRENT TOXIC POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT >>. IT IS ALL OR NOTHING. >>. JULIE JOHNSTON IS NOW. HOW MUCH OF A SURPRISE IS IT THAT KRISTEN CINEMA IS NOT GOING TO RUN AGAIN? AND WHERE DOES THIS LEAVE? THE ARIZONA SENATE RACE >>. Reporter. IT WAS SOMEWHAT OF A SURPRISE TO THOSE ON CAPITOL HILL AND EVEN HER COLLEAGUES BUT THE FACT THAT SHE DECIDED NOT TO RUN IS NOT REALLY A SURPRISE TO THOSE OF US WHO HAVE COVERED HER AND WATCHED HER CLOSELY. I WAS TOLD BY SOME SOURCES THAT THE BIPARTISAN BILL WAS REALLY THE LINCHPIN TO DECIDE WHETHER SHE IS GOING TO CONTINUE FORWARD AND HAVE SOMETHING TO FORWARD AND HAVE SOMETHING TO RUN ON IN THE STATE, IN DEMOCRATS, OR WHETHER SHE IS GOING TO BOW OUT BECAUSE SHE HAS SEEN THE WRITING ON THE WALL AND CERTAINLY THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED. IN THIS SITUATION, THE RACE IS EFFECTIVELY BETWEEN REPUBLICAN CARRIE LAKE, WHO WAS ON CAPITOL HILL YESTERDAY AND TOLD ME SHE HAS OTHER ENDORSEMENTS COMING- AND THE DEMOCRAT, WHO IS A MEMBER OF THE HOUSE AND HAS KNOWN HER FOR SOME TIME. I DID TALK TO LAKE YESTERDAY AT THE CAPITOL AND HERE IS WHAT SHE HAD TO SAY: >> WE DISAGREE ON PROBABLY EVERY POLICY. I APPRECIATE A COUPLE OF VERY STRONG POINTS. >>. CARRIE LAKE HAS HAD SOME VERY DISCOURAGING COMMENTS ON KRISTEN CINEMA AND OTHERS. BUT SHE DID SAY ONE OF THE THINGS SHE FEARS IS THE FILIBUSTER GOING AWAY. NOW THAT SHE IS OUT AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE SENATOR HAS ALSO VOTED TO PROTECT THE FILIBUSTER. CERTAINLY THIS WILL CHANGE. WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN THAT VERY COMPETITIVE RACE. >>. THAT WAS A WAY RACE DOWN TO TWO PEOPLE. HOW IS IT GOING? >> JOHN, HE SAID HE HAS DECIDED TO RUN FOR THE NUMBER TWO POSITION, THE ONE WHO COUNTS THE VOTES, AND ALSO VERY IMPORTANT. SO THAT LEAVES THIS AND TOOK AWAY. RACE BETWEEN JOHN CORNYN AND JOHN KUHN. HOWEVER, WE ARE LIKE NINE MONTHS AWAY FROM THIS DECISION. EVEN HAPPENING, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT OTHERS COULD JUMP IN THE RACE. RICK SCOTT HAD JUMPED IN, AND WHO IS CURRENTLY THE GUY IN CHARGE OF SENATE? REPUBLICANS INTO CONGRESS. SO THERE'S A LOT THAT CAN HAPPEN. BUT RIGHT, NOW IT IS BETWEEN THOSE TWO GUYS AND THEY ARE TRYING TO VOTE LOCKUP SUPPORT >>. JOHN VERSUS, JOHN VERSUS, JOHN, YOU POINT OUT THAT THIS WILL NOT HAPPEN UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTION. SO HOW MUCH COULD THE ELECTION AND THE RESULTS. WHETHER TRUMP WINDSOR LOSES AND WHETHER THE REPUBLICANS TAKE CONTROL OF THE SENATE OR NOT. HOW MUCH DID JAZZ --. DOES THAT INFLUENCE? >>. IT DOES INFLUENCE. JOHN CORNYN AND JOHN KUHN, THEY HAD A TOUGH RELATIONSHIP BUT HE REALLY SEES THE WRITING ON THE WALL THAT THIS GUY IS GOING TO BECOME THE PARTY'S NOMINEE AND IF HE BECOMES PRESIDENT, THE MINORITY LEADER CERTAINLY HAS TO WORK WITH HIM. SO THAT WHEN HAVE SOME AFFECTS ALSO INTERESTING. I ASKED CARRIE LAKE THIS QUESTION YESTERDAY. SHE IS NO FAN OF McCONNELL, SHE SAYS SHE HAS NO PREDICTION YET. BUT SHE DID SAY THOSE VYING TO BE LEADER WILL COME OUT IN THE COMING DAYS. AND THAT COULD BE TELLING, BECAUSE SHE IS IN ALIGNMENT WITH TRUMP. AGAIN. TRUMP CAN ALWAYS PUT HIS THUMB ON THE SCALE, AS HE IS KNOWN TO DO, AND DECIDE THE LEADERS THAT WAY. BUT WE HAVE A LOT OF TIME. >>>. TURNING NOW TO THE WAR IN GAZA, AND HAMAS SAYS IT IS PUSHING AHEAD WITH CEASE-FIRE TALKS IN CAIRO. >>. WHILE THE MILITANT GROUP HAS BEEN LOCKED IN, ISRAEL DID NOT SEND A DELEGATION UNDER THIS SIX WEEK CEASE-FIRE DEAL BEING DISCUSSED. THERE WOULD BE A RELEASE OF HOSTAGES AND PALESTINIAN PRISONERS AND AN INCREASE IN AID TO GAZA'S STARVING POPULATION >>. WE KNOW THERE IS AN URGENCY TO GET THE DEAL DONE BEFORE THE START OF RAMADAN. SPECIFICALLY, WHERE DO THINGS STAND THIS MORNING AND WHAT IS THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION SAYING? >>. Reporter. WE ARE CERTAINLY HEARING THE URGENCY FROM THE WHITE HOUSE, FROM THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS. TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT BIDEN HAD TO SAY. >> WE ARE IN THE HANDS OF HAMAS RIGHT NOW. THE ISRAELIS HAVE BEEN COOPERATING. WE WILL KNOW IN A COUPLE OF DAYS WE NEED TO CEASE-FIRE. THERE HAS GOT TO BE A CEASE-. THERE HAS GOT TO BE A CEASE- FIRE BECAUSE RAMADAN. IF THIS CONTINUES INTO RAMADAN, IT COULD BE VERY, VERY DANGEROUS STOCK. RAMADAN STARTS ON MARCH 10th. JUST A COUPLE OF DAYS AWAY. THE DELEGATION IN CAIRO SAYS: NO AGREEMENT HAD BEEN MET YESTERDAY AND, POINTING A FINGER THIS MORNING, THEY DID NOT BOTHER TO SEND A DELEGATION TO CAIRO. WE ARE NOT HEARING THE SAME KIND OF URGENCY ABOUT HOSTAGE RELEASE NEGOTIATIONS >>. THE URGENCY OUTSIDE OF THAT SEEMS TO BE COMING FROM THE LEVEL OF STARVATION IN GAZA, WHICH IS WHY SO MANY PEOPLE WANT TO SEE A CEASE-FIRE. A CONVOY TURNED AWAY BY ISRAELI FORCES AND ALSO A DAMNING NEW REPORT BY EXPERTS ACCUSING ISRAEL OF INTENTIONALLY STARVING PEOPLE IN GAZA TARGETING A CONVOY'S. WHAT MORE CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THAT AND HOW ISRAEL IS RESPONDING? >>. Reporter LANGUAGE ABOUT THOSE EXPERTS WHICH I WILL GET TO REMEMBER. THE WORLD FOOD PROGRAM PAUSED THE CONVOYS TO THE NORTH OF GAZA, WHERE ORGANIZATIONS, THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF MALNUTRITION AND SEVERE STARVATION ARE HAPPENING NOW. THEY PAUSED THOSE CONVOYS BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT GET THOSE TRUCKS SAFELY IN. A 14-TRUCK CONVOY WAS TURNED BACK BY THE MILITARY AT THE ONE, BECAUSE IT CHECKPOINT. BECAUSE IT CHECKPOINT -- GAZA CHECKPOINT. THE ONLY WAY IS AIRDROPS AND OTHER OPTIONS BY C. THOSE ARE LAST RESORT AND FROM THAT PANEL I WANT TO READ ONE LINE TO YOU, FROM THESE UN EXPERTS. THEY SAY ISRAEL IS INTENTIONALLY STARVING THAT GAZAN PEOPLE AND IT IS TARGETING CIVILIANS SEEKING AID. ISRAEL MUST END ITS CAMPAIGN OF STARVATION AND TARGETING CIVILIANS. AND THAT IS A DIRECT QUOTE REALLY QUESTIONING ISRAEL'S COMMITMENT. >>. ISRAEL'S WAR CABINET MINISTER IS IN THE UNITED STATES MEETING WITH OFFICIALS OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS. WHAT CAME OUT OF THOSE TALKS? >>. Reporter. HE HAS BEEN IN THE UNITED STATES. THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN SPEAKING WITH THE SAME MESSAGE FROM THE SECRETARY OF STATE BLINKEN FROM THE PRESIDENT: GET MORE AID. WHY IS ISRAEL PUTTING UP OBSTACLES AND ALL SIGNS OF THE WHITE HOUSE UPPING PRESSURE ON THE GOVERNMENT? EVEN THOUGH GIFT IS A MEMBER OF THE WAR CABINET AND HE IS AN INFLUENTIAL VOICE. HE IS NOT THE FINAL VOICE. HE IS HERE IN LONDON AND EXPECTED TO HAVE A MEETING WITH DAVID CAMERON. THE UK, SIMILARLY, HAS RUN OUT OF PATIENCE AND WE HEARD HIM YESTERDAY. HE IS VERY STRONG LANGUAGE PREVIEWING HIS MEETING OF TODAY. BUT THE FACT THAT HE IS IN THE UNITED STATES, ARE NOW IN THE UK WAS NOT THROUGH THE BENJAMIN NETANYAHU GOVERNMENT- BENJAMIN NETANYAHU GOVERNMENT OR THROUGH THE FOREIGN MINISTE. THAT REALLY SUGGESTS AND POINTS TO THE FACT THAT THE UK AND THE UNITED STATES ARE GETTING EXASPERATED >>>. THE SOGGY WEATHER IS HERE TO STAY ON THE EAST COAST BUT FLOOD WATCH IS FOR 30 MILLION PEOPLE STRETCHING FROM NEW PEOPLE, STRETCHING FROM NEW JERSEY TO MASSACHUSETTS >>. UMBRELLAS ARE NEEDED AND WE HAVE ALREADY HAD A LINE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WORKING THROUGH SOUTH FLORIDA. THAT IS MOVING OUT BUT WE HAVE LEFT OVER LINGERING RAIN ACROSS PARTS OF THE SOUTHEAST. IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS, PLACES LIKE ATLANTA ALREADY PICKING UP A COUPLE OF INCHES OF RAIN AS WE LOOK FROM THE MID- ATLANTIC TO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY. WE HAVE ALREADY BEEN SOGGY FOR THE BETTER PART OF THE MORNING HOURS AND YOU CAN SEE IT HAS BEEN PRETTY QUIET ACROSS THE NORTHEAST SO FAR. THIS MOISTURE WILL START TO LIFT AND WE WILL BE DEALING WITH SOME BUSY CONDITIONS, ESPECIALLY ALONG THE I-95 CORRIDOR, AS WE GET INTO THE REALLY IMPORTANT COMMUTE TIME. 30 MILLION PEOPLE, INCLUDING THOSE IN NEW YORK, BOSTON, ALL INCLUDED WITH THE MAJOR CITIES, BEING IMPACTED BY THE POTENTIAL OF FLASH, FLOODING AND PLENTY OF MOISTURE WILL LIFT INTO THE AREA. WE HAVE A CHANCE FOR SOME IMPRESSIVE RAINFALL RATES: ONE OR TWO INCHES PER HOUR, A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, PROLONGED RAIN, NOT HARD FOR US TO SEE THAT FLOODING, ESPECIALLY IN THE VULNERABLE AREAS THIS EVENING YOU CAN SEE THIS RAIN WILL BE AROUND EVEN WELL. PAST THE AFTERNOON, COMMUTE WELL INTO THE EVENING. WE WILL STILL BE DEALING WITH THE RAINFALL FOR PORTIONS OF VIRGINIA. THAT IS SOMETHING WE HAVE TO WATCH FOR, AND THE MODERATE TO HEAVY RAIN WILL BE FROM VIRGINIA TO MAINE. THIS RAIN WILL STICK AROUND FOR THE FIRST HALF OF THE DAY FOR SOME LOCATIONS AND EVENTUALLY MOVE OUT. THAT SYSTEM MOVES OFFSHORE AND IT WILL BE LOOKING BETTER, BUT NOT BEFORE WE DEAL WITH THAT EARLY RAIN FOR THE FIRST HALF OF THE DAY, WE WILL SEE SOME DRIER CONDITIONS AND WE WILL GET THE MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS: RAINFALL TOTALS FROM ONE TO TWO INCHES UP TO THREE INCHES ACROSS THE NORTHEAST. THE FLASH FLOODING IS GOING TO BE SOMETHING WE CONTINUE TO HAVE AS A POTENTIAL, NOT JUST TODAY.",[52]

AND GADI SCHWARTZ, WELCOME TO STAY TUNED. NOW BREAKING NEWS OUT OF DC. THE SUPREME COURT JUST AGREED TO TAKE UP FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP'S IMMUNITY CASE, AND THE IMPLICATIONS ARE HUGE. WE HEARD TRUMP SAY AGAIN AND AGAIN HE IS IMMUNE FROM PROSECUTION FOR WHAT HAPPENED WHILE PRESIDENT. BECAUSE THAT IS HOW PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY WORKS. IT IS NOT THAT SIMPLE. THE SUPREME COURT WILL TAKE UP THE ISSUE AND WHATEVER THEY DECIDE, WILL HAVE MASSIVE RAMIFICATIONS GOING FOR IT AND HOWEVER IT TURNS OUT. JUST BY DECIDING TO PICK UP THE CASE, THE HIGH COURT IS DELAYING THE ACTUAL TRIAL BY WEEKS, IF NOT MONTHS, MEANING IT COULD BE WELL INTO THE ELECTION BEFORE WE GET A CONCRETE DECISION. CORRESPONDENT KEN DILANIAN JOINS US NOW. THIS COULD SET A MASSIVE PRECEDENT WITH. THIS AFFECT THE FEDERAL ELECTION INTERFERENCE CASE OR CHARGES FROM THE OTHER CASES AS WELL >>. Reporter. IF THE COURT RULES, THERE IS SOME LEVEL OF RESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY THAT COULD AFFECT THE GEORGIA PROSECUTION. IT IS ALONG THE SAME LINES AS THE ELECTION PROSECUTION IN DC, EXCEPT INVOLVING STATE CHARGES, CERTAINLY RELEVANT THE CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS CASE BEING HEARD IN FLORIDA. LESS RELEVANT BECAUSE THE CONDUCT ALLEGED THERE HAPPENED AFTER DONALD TRUMP LEFT OFFICE. THIS IS A HUGE ISSUE ON SO MANY LEVELS. FIRST OF ALL, IT WILL DELAY WHETHER THE CASE CAN GO TO TRIAL BEFORE THE ELECTION. THAT IS IN QUESTION RIGHT NOW. SECONDLY, THE SUPREME COURT HAS NEVER WEIGHED ON ON THIS MOMENTUM -- MOMENTOUS- QUESTION- WHETHER A PRESIDENT IS IMMUNE FOR HIS ACTIONS. WHILE IN OFFICE, GERALD FORD PARDONED RICHARD NIXON ON THE ASSUMPTION HE WOULD BE CHARGED AFTER WATERGATE. IT HAS LONG BEEN ASSUMED. PRESIDENTS ARE LIABLE AND DON'T HAVE A GET OUT OF JAIL FREE CARD. THERE ARE THINGS PRESIDENTS DO AS COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, YOU COULD SAY THAT IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD NOT BE PROSECUTED FOR. IT IS A BIG CASE, LIKE A TAKE A WHILE >> TALK ABOUT THE MAKEUP OF THE COURT. THREE TRUMP APPOINTEES SERVING ON THE SUPREME COURT. IS THE CASE GOING TO GO IN HIS FAVOR, BASED ON THE NUMBERS >>. Reporter, NOT IN THAT PARTISAN SENSE. IT IS TRUE CONSERVATIVE JUSTICES. SOME MEMBERS OF COURT TAKE A MORE EXPANSIVE VIEW OF WHAT EXECUTIVE POWER THAN THEIR LIBERAL COLLEAGUES. THAT MAY INFLUENCE HOW THEY SEE THE QUESTION OF RESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY. THE ARGUMENT DONALD TRUMP MADE HIS LAWYERS MADE BEFORE THE APPEALS COURT. ESSENTIALLY, A PRESIDENT COULD ORDER THE ASSASSINATION OF A POLITICAL OPPONENT AND NOT BE PROSECUTED. A MUSTY WAS FIRST IMPEACHED. THAT IS OBSERVED AND GOES AGAINST AMERICAN JURISPRUDENCE AND NOBODY THINKS THE SUPREME COURT WILL GO THERE. THERE COULD BE SOME LEVEL OF PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY. >>. COULD YOU WALK US THROUGH THE TIMING OF THIS? THERE ARE A LOT OF CASES AND FLURRY OF COURT DOCUMENTS LEADING UP TO THE ELECTION. WHAT HAPPENS NEXT >>. Reporter. THIS ELECTION CASE PEOPLE THINK OF IS THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL CASE: CHUCK SMITH, PROSECUTION OF DONALD TRUMP, TRAINED OVERTIME. THE ELECTION THAT WOULD GO TO TRIAL AROUND APRIL. NOW IT IS ON. HOLD THIS UP IN COURT. WILL HEAR THE CASE IN APRIL. POTENTIAL TURNAROUND OPINION BY JUNE BEST CASE SCENARIO AND PERHAPS THAT CASE WILL MOVE FORWARD TO TRIAL OVER THE SUMMER. YOU HAVE THE CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS CASE IN FLORIDA HEARING ON FRIDAY ABOUT THE SCHEDULING THERE. THAT IS FAR UP IN THE AIR. THE GEORGIA CASE IS NOTHING CLOSE TO GOING TO TRIAL PICK. THE ONE CASE CLOSED TO TRIAL IS THE NEW YORK CASE INVOLVING THE HUSH MONEY DONALD TRUMP ACCUSED OF VIOLATING CAMPAIGN LAW BY PAYING A PORNOGRAPHY STAR. THAT IS THE LEAST CONSEQUENTIAL OF THE LEGAL CASES AGAINST DONALD TRUMP BUT THE ONE THAT GOES TO TRIAL BEFORE HE IS ON THE BALLOT. >>. SPEAKING OF COURT DOCKETS, NEW COURT DOCKETS, MORE BREAKING NEWS. WE JUST THOUGHT ILLINOIS JUDGE REMOVED TRUMP FROM THE PRIMARY BALLOT THERE BUT POSSIBLY STATED THAT ORDER PAUSED. THAT ORDER HOPING. TRUMP LAWYERS WOULD RESPOND WHAT IS GOING ON? >>. Reporter. THIS IS THE THIRD STATE THAT REMOVED DONALD TRUMP FROM THE BALLOT ON THE GROUNDS. HE COMMITTED INSURRECTION AND UNDER THE 14th AMENDMENT, HE IS DISQUALIFIED. THE SUPREME COURT HEARD AN APPEAL OF THE COLORADO DECISION ON THAT AND IT SEEMED LIKE THE MAJORITY OF JUSTICES WERE NOT BUYING THAT ARGUMENT. IT IS WIDELY EXPECTED. FAIRLY SOON THE SUPREME COURT WILL COME OUT WITH AN OPINION SAYING THAT DONALD TRUMP CANNOT BE DISQUALIFIED FROM THE BALLOT ON THOSE GROUNDS. THIS ILLINOIS DECISION MAY BE A MOOT POINT. WE HAVE TO SEE WHAT THE SUPREME COURT DOES >>>. IN TEXAS, ONE PERSON HAS DIED BECAUSE OF THE FAST-MOVING WILDFIRES RIPPING THROUGH THE PANHANDLE. ONE OF THE FIRES- THE BIGGEST IN STATE HISTORY- RIGHT NOW EVACUATIONS AND POWER OUTAGES THROUGHOUT THE AREA, INCLUDING NEAR THE TOWN OF CANADIAN TEXAS, NOT FAR FROM AMARILLO. DOZENS OF HOMES HAVE BURNED AT. THE BIGGEST CONCERT IS THE SMOKEHOUSE CREEK FIRE, WHICH HAS BECOME THE SECOND- LARGEST WILDFIRE IN TEXAS HISTORY. IT IS BURNING IN AREA THE SIZE OF THE STATE OF RHODE ISLAND. THAT HAS GROWN 20 TIMES ITS ORIGINAL SIZE IN 48 HOURS. THAT EXPLOSIVE GROWTH IS MAKING IT HARD FOR FIREFIGHTERS TO KEEP UP. >>. WE HAVE SUPER HIGH WINDS COMING INTO THE AREA WITH LOW HUMIDITY AND CAUSING MASSIVE FIRE GROWTH CAN'T GET AROUND AT THIS POINT. YOU >> GUAD VENEGAS- IS FOLLOWING THIS. IT LOOKS LIKE ONE OF THOSE TERRIFYING FIRES THAT IS SO BIG. THE ONLY WAY TO SLOW IT DOWN IS A BREAK IN THE WEATHER. >>. Reporter- IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT IS WHAT THEY NEED: A LOT OF THE LARGE FIRES. THE WEATHER CAN MAKE IT BETTER OR WORSE, AND HAVING THAT INFRASTRUCTURE TO DO THAT CONTAINMENT BUT A FIRE THIS BIG, OVER 100 MILES LONG, STRETCHING OVER VARIOUS COUNTIES IN THE PANHANDLE AREA OF TEXAS, DOES REQUIRE HELP FROM THE WEATHER. WHAT I CAN SAY IS THAT TODAY, THE CONDITIONS WE HAVE SEEN HAVE NOT BEEN SO WINDY COMPARED TO WHAT THE NEIGHBORS TOLD ME THEY SAW. THE DAY BEFORE I SPOKE TO ONE OF THE NEIGHBORS IN THE AREA WHERE YOU SEE THE HOMES BURNED DOWN. THEY TOLD ME WHEN THE FIRE CAME THROUGH THIS AREA, THEY WERE VERY STRONG WINDS THAT TOOK THE FIRE. A NEIGHBOR TOLD ME THEY WERE STANDING OUTSIDE THEIR HOUSE TO MY LEFT. IT TOOK 20 SECONDS FROM THE MOMENT THEY SAW THE FIRE FAR AWAY TO THE MOMENT WHEN THE NEIGHBOR'S HOME WAS ON FIRE. BECAUSE OF THE WIND CONDITIONS IMPROVE FOR THE FIREFIGHTERS TO KEEP FIGHTING THE FIRE AND THE CONTAINMENT TO BE MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE THAN THIS CAN SLOW DOWN. THE FIRE PIT. AS OF NOW WE KNOW IT IS MORE THAN 850,000 ACRES, SO IT IS A LARGE FIRE. AUTHORITIES ARE KEEPING AN EYE ON A LOT OF COMMUNITIES, WITH PEOPLE THAT HAD TO HAVE A GREAT THEIR HOMES BECAUSE OF THE FIRE. >>. THE DEVASTATION BEHIND YOU IS INCREDIBLE. WHERE PEOPLE GOING WHEN THEY LOSE THEIR HOMES? >>. Reporter. EVERY COUNTY IS SETTING UP EVACUATION CENTERS. FOR EXAMPLE, HERE WE HAVE AN ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOOD THAT BURNED DOWN. THIS IS ONE OF THE HOMES THAT YOU CAN SEE BEHIND ME DOWN THE ROAD. THERE IS A CHURCH THAT HAS SPACE FOR ANYONE THAT LOST THEIR HOME. IN THIS AREA I SPOKE TO NEIGHBORS. IF THEY CAN, THEY'RE GOING WITH FRIENDS OR FAMILY MEMBERS. THERE ARE RESOURCES AND THE COMMUNITY IS COMING TOGETHER TO HELP THOSE WHO LOST THEIR HOMES, AND EVERYBODY WAITS FOR THE FIRE TO BE OVER. IT WILL BE MORE TIME, BECAUSE WHEN WE LOOK AT THE MAP AND UPDATES OFFERED BY THE STATE FIREFIGHTERS IN TEXAS, WE CAN SEE HOW LARGE IT IS AND STILL GROWING. LOOKING AT THE DISTANCE TO MY LEFT, WE CAN SEE WHERE THE SMOKE CONTINUES TO BURN. >> IN AMARILLO, A LOT OF FEAR ABOUT A NUCLEAR WEAPON SITE. WHAT IS THE LATEST WITH THAT SITE? >>. Reporter. THAT IS 30 MILES SOUTH OF US, JUST A LITTLE BIT EAST OF AMARILLO NUCLEAR WEAPON FACILITY SHUTDOWN WHEN WE HEARD ABOUT IT BEING SHUT DOWN AND OUT OF ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION. IF YOU LOOK AT THE MAP, THAT FACILITY IS VERY CLOSE TO THE AREAS CLOSED DOWN. THERE ARE ROADS NEARBY. WE TRIED TO GET ON TODAY TO GET TO THE AREA THAT WERE ALSO SHUT DOWN. BECAUSE OF THAT, THE PLANT HAS BEEN CLOSED AND WORKERS EVACUATED. AS EVERYONE WAITS TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS, AS YOU MENTIONED, A LOT OF ATTENTION WILL BE PAID TO THE WEATHER TO SEE HOW THE CONDITIONS IMPROVE OR BECOME MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE FIREFIGHTERS OVER THE WEEKEND. >>. TRAGIC DEVASTATION BEHIND YOU. IT IS HEARTBREAKING. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. >>>. CANCELED EXECUTION IN IDAHO BECAUSE THE MEDICAL TEAM FAILED EIGHT TIMES TO LETHALLY INJECT A SERIAL KILLER ON DEATH ROW. 73-YEAR-OLD THOMAS CREECH, SCHEDULED TO BE EXECUTED THIS MORNING BUT AFTER FAILING OVER AND OVER AGAIN TO SUCCESSFULLY PUT AN IV INTO HIS ARM, IDAHO DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTION DIRECTOR DECIDED IT WAS A NO. THE DEATH WARRANT HAS EXPIRED AND HIS STATUS AS ONE OF THE LONGEST-SERVING DEATH ROW INMATES IN THE UNITED STATES CONTINUES. LET'S GO TO ELLEN LOPEZ FOR THE LATEST BOTCHED EXECUTION. WHAT HAPPENED AND WHAT DOES A EXPIRED DEATH WARRANT EVENING? >>. Reporter. THIS WILL BE IDAHO'S FIRST EXECUTION IN MORE THAN A DECADE. AFTER 40 MINUTES IT WAS HALTED. THOMAS CREECH WAS SET TO BE EXECUTED BY LETHAL INJECTION, BUT THE MEDICAL TEAM WAS UNABLE TO TAP INTO THE VEIN TO PLACE THE IV. THEY TRIED EIGHT TIMES, STARTED WITH ONE ARM AND STARTED WITH THE NEXT AND MOVED ON TO THE LEGS. AT ONE POINT HE SAID HIS LEGS HURT. OFFICIALS SAID IT WAS A CRAMPED. THEY LIFTED HIM UP TO RELIEVE SOME OF THE PAIN. AFTER TRYING OVER AND OVER TO GET ACCESS TO A VEIN, THEY STOP THE EXECUTION ALTOGETHER. THE BIG ISSUE, THEY SAID, WAS THE QUALITY OF HIS VEINS, NOT JUST ACCESS POINTS. THAT DID A PHYSICAL EXAM ON HIM AND DID NOT SEE THE ISSUES. AND BUT STATE OFFICIALS BELIEVE IT WAS THE VEINS AND POOR QUALITY. THAT DID NOT. LET IT BE CARRIED OUT. THEY'RE GOING BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD. THEY WILL LET THE DEATH WARRANT EXPIRE. AFTER THE ORDEAL, THE 73-YEAR- OLD MET WITH HIS WIFE AND WAS TAKEN TO HIS CELL. WE ARE WAITING TO HEAR WHAT THE NEXT STEPS WILL BE. >>. THAT IS A WEIRD CASE. WE HAVE ARCHIVE FOOTAGE OF HIM FROM 1981 EXPLAINING HOW HE FELT. BACK THEN ABOUT THE DEATH PENALTY, LET'S TAKE A QUICK LOOK. >>. Reporter, TELL ME WHY YOU PLEADED GUILTY. SPEAK IT --. >>. BECAUSE I DID IT, I'M READY TO DIE. IT IS HARD TO LIVE WITH THIS. >>. Reporter CREECH HAS BEEN. >>. Reporter CREECH HAS BEEN LOCKED UP SINCE 1974, DO WE KNOW IF HE FEELS THE SAME WAY HE DID IN THAT VIDEO? CAN YOU REMIND US WHAT HE DID TO END UP ON DEATH ROW IN THE FIRST PLACE? >>. Reporter. I WANT TO POINT SOMETHING OUT IN THAT SAME INTERVIEW. HE TOLD THE REPORTER HE HATED NEEDLES. HE WANTED TO BE HANGED OR FIRING SQUAD PICKED FAST FORWARD. FOUR DECADES LATER, HIS ATTORNEYS FILED A FLURRY OF APPEAL TRYING TO STAY. THE EXECUTION SUPPORTERS SAY HE IS A CHANGED MAN. BUT THIS IS SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN CONVICTED OF KILLING FIVE PEOPLE IN THREE STATES, INCLUDING A FELLOW INMATE OF HIS, IN 1981, THAT SAME YEAR AS THE INTERVIEW, AND HE CONFESSED THE INTERVIEW AND HE CONFESSED TO DOZENS MORE. >>>. ANOTHER DAY OF DRAMATIC TESTIMONY. IN THE MANSLAUGHTER TRIAL AGAINST THE ARMORER ON THE MOVIE SET, RUST HANNAH GUTIERREZ-REED, ONE OF THE DETECTIVES ON THE CASE, AND LINE PRODUCERS TOOK THE STAND AND TESTIFIED ABOUT THE MOMENT WHAT LED UP TO THE SHOOTING THAT KILLED CINEMATOGRAPHER HALYNA HUTCHIN. THE SEARCH FOR THE SOURCE OF THE LIVE ROUNDS CONTINUES. PROSECUTORS SAY GUTIERREZ-REED WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR LIVE BULLETS IN THE GUN. ALEC BALDWIN SAYS HE WAS HOLDING WHEN IT WENT OFF. SHE HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH MANSLAUGHTER AND TAMPERING WITH EVIDENCE AND FACES UP TO 18 MONTHS IN PRISON. LET'S GET INTO IT WITH CORRESPONDENT DANA GRIFFIN, WHO HAS BEEN COVERING THE TRIAL FROM SANTA FE, WHO JOINS US NOW. THANKS FOR BEING WITH US. WE SAW MORE POLICE INTERROGATION VIDEO OF HANNAH GUTIERREZ-REED. WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED? >>? Reporter. WE LEARNED WHAT HANNAH GUTIERREZ-REED THE DAY OF THAT SHOOTING. ALSO WHAT SHE DID NOT DO. SHE SAYS THE BOX OF AMMO THAT WAS MARKED DUMMIES SHE HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE AND SHE TOOK ONE ROUND FROM THE BOX AND LOADED IT INTO THE BALDWIN REVOLVER. SHE ALSO TALKED ABOUT HOW SHE CHECKED THE WEAPON BEFORE LUNCH LOCKED IT AWAY IN THE GUN SAFE BUT SHE MISSED A KEY STEP MOMENTS BEFORE THE DEADLY SHOOTING LISTEN >>. I WAS NOT ABLE TO DO THE LAST CHECK BEFORE ALEC GOT IT BECAUSE I HAD NO IDEA THE GUN HAD BEEN HANDED OFF. I HEAR IN THE EAR PIECE MEDICAL EMERGENCY. I GO TO THE CHURCH AND I SEE PEOPLE ON THE GROUND. OH MY GOD, WAS THAT THE GUN? >>. Reporter. AFTER THE SHOOTING, HANNAH GUTIERREZ-REED SAID THAT DAVE HALL BROUGHT HER THE GUN. SHE LOOKED AT IT AND COULD SEE ONE OF THE ROUNDS HAD BEEN FIRED, BUT THE REST WERE DUMMIES. >>. TAKING A QUICK LOOK AT THE END -- INTERROGATION ROOM. HERE'S HOW SHE DESCRIBED INTERVIEW WITH GUTIERREZ-REED WHEN DETECTIVES TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW THE LIVE ROUNDS ENDED UP ON THE SET. >>. SHE WAS THE ONE THAT HANDED THE BOX. HANNAH GUTIERREZ THAT THAT WAS THE BOX SHE WAS PULLING FROM ALONG WITH THE VARIOUS CHANDELIERS THAT WE COLLECTED WITH THE LIVE AMMUNITION SHE IDENTIFIED AS BRINGING FROM HER PREVIOUS SET THAT SHE WORKED ON THE OTHER BOX OF DUMMIES. IT DID NOT MATCH THE BOX. SHE HAD BROUGHT AND IDENTIFIED THE ROUNDS INSIDE THE BOX. THE DUMMIES THAT WE SAW DID NOT MATCH. ALL OF THIS IN TOTALITY IS WHAT WE USED IN OUR INVESTIGATION. IN HANNAH'S INTERVIEW SHE TOLD ME SHE WAS THE ONE THAT LOADED ALEC'S GUN SPEED AND YET, WHERE DID THE LIVE ROUNDS COME FROM? ANYMORE LIGHT SHED ON >>. Reporter. THAT IS THE ONE MILLION-DOLLAR QUESTION PROSECUTORS CONCLUDED. HANNAH GUTIERREZ-REED WAS THE SOURCE OF THE LIVE ROUNDS ENDING UP ON SET. DURING CROSS-EXAMINATION, THE DETECTIVES NOTED SHE DID NOT HAVE DIRECT EVIDENCE OF WHEN THE LIVE ROUNDS ACTUALLY APPEARED ON SET. SO IT IS STILL A MYSTERY. >>. WE HEARD FROM HIM AND THAT HANDED THE GUN TO ALEC BALDWIN. WHAT DID HE SAY? >>. Reporter. WE EXPECTED TO HEAR FROM DAVE HALL TODAY BECAUSE THERE WERE SO MANY DELAYS IN COURT THEY WERE PLANNING TO CALL HIM TOMORROW, EXCITING TO HEAR FROM HIM. WE HAVE SEEN ALEC BALDWIN'S ATTORNEY IN COURT. HER NAME IS HEATHER. WE HAVE SEEN HER OUTSIDE OF COURT DILIGENTLY TAKING NOTES, LISTENING TO EVERY BIT OF TESTIMONY. OBVIOUSLY SHE IS PREPARING FOR THAT CASE, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO GO TO TRIAL IN JULY. >>>. TODAY A HEARING WAS HELD. >>> TODAY, A HEARING WAS HELD FOR BRENT KOHBERGER, THE MAN ACCUSED OF KILLING FOUR UNIVERSITIES IDAHO STUDENTS IN 2022.. THE JUDGE MAKING IT CLEAR: A POSSIBLE TRIAL WON'T HAPPEN UNTIL NEXT YEAR. ERIN McLAUGHLIN IS HERE WITH THE LATEST FROM THE COURTROOM: >>. Reporter GOING INTO THIS COURT HEARING THE PROSECUTION FILED A MOTION ASKING FOR TRIAL DATE TO BE SET: SUMMER OF THIS YEAR. BUT DURING THE COURT PROCEEDING EVEN, THE PROSECUTION ACKNOWLEDGED THAT WAS NOT ENOUGH TIME AND THEY WOULD NOT HAVE THE DISCOVERY IN THE CASE FULLY BY THE END OF THE SUMMER. THEY ARGUED FOR MARCH 2025 COURT DATE. THE DEFENSE PUSHING BACK VERY HARD ON THAT, SAYING SIMPLY: IT WAS NOT ENOUGH TIME, GIVEN THE VOLUME OF DISCOVERY IN THIS CASE AND PUSHING FOR A CHANGE OF VENUE HEARING. THE JUDGE FIGHTING WITH THE DEFENSE FOR THAT REQUEST OF CHANGE OF VENUE HEARING. THAT HEARING IS SET FOR MAY. THE DEFENSE HAS BEEN PUSHING FOR CHANGE OF VENUE. THEY DON'T WANT THE TRIAL TO HAPPEN IN MOSCOW, IDAHO, THEY WANTED TO HAPPEN SOMEWHERE ELSE WHERE THE JURY POOL IS LARGER. ARGUING THE AMOUNT OF PUBLICITY IN THE CASE AND THE SALACIOUS MESS OF THE ALLEGATIONS REQUIRE THAT LARGER JURY POOL, THE PROSECUTION PUSHING BACK ON THAT WE ARE EXPECTING TO HEAR MUCH MORE IN TERMS OF THE CONTOURS OF THOSE ARGUMENTS IN THE MAY HEARING AFTER. THAT THE JUDGE SAYING HE WILL CONSIDER A TRIAL DATE, ALSO CITING ANOTHER DEADLINE IN TODAY'S PROCEEDINGS GIVING THE DEFENSE UNTIL MID APRIL TO SUBSTANTIATE THE ALIBI BRENT KOHBERGER LONG MAINTAINED THAT HE WAS OUT DRIVING THE NIGHT OF THE MURDERS'S LAWYER IN COURT. TODAY SAYING THEY HAVE MORE EXPERT TESTIMONY TO BOLSTER. THAT THE JUDGE SETTING THE MID- APRIL DEADLINE FOR THAT EXPERT TESTIMONY TO BE PUT FORWARD BY >>> WELCOME BACK. >>> WELCOME BACK HUNTER BIDEN BACK ON CAPITOL HILL TODAY. WE WILL TELL YOU WHY IN A MINUTE. >>>. OTHER HEADLINES WERE WATCHING. TONIGHT THE JUDGE RULED AGAINST DONALD TRUMP IN THE CIVIL FRAUD TRIAL. ARTHUR ENGORON WAS SENT ENVELOP WITH WHITE POWDER SOURCES, TELL NBC NEWS RESPONSE TO THE COURTHOUSE. THE JUDGE WAS NOT EXPOSED TO THE SUBSTANCE. OFFICER OF THE COURT OPEN THE PACKAGE WHEN THE POWDER FELL OUT. >>>. PRESIDENT BIDEN TODAY ISSUED EXECUTIVE ORDERS AND THAT PROTECTING SENSITIVE DATA FROM SO-CALLED HOSTILE COUNTRIES. THE NEW MEASURE TARGETS BUSINESSES THAT SELL PEOPLE'S PERSONAL INFORMATION AND THE WHITE HOUSE IS WORRIED. ALL OF THAT PERSONAL DATA COULD END UP IN THE HANDS OF COUNTRY THAT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF AMERICANS. >>>. LOOKS LIKE MITCH McCONNELL IS STEPPING DOWN AFTER THE SENATE MINORITY LEADER AT THE END OF THE YEAR, AFTER THE LONGEST LEADERSHIP STRETCH IN SENATE HISTORY. McCONNELL HAD RECENT HEALTH ISSUES AND MONTHS LEADING TO A FALL WITH FRACTURED RIBS. >>>. HUNDREDS OF PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS PROTESTED OUTSIDE THE ALABAMA STATE, CALLING ON LAWMAKERS TO CHANGE THE RECENT IVF RULING. THE GOVERNOR EXPECTS THE BILL PROTECTING IVF TO LAND ON HER DESK SOON.

HE DIED IN LOS ANGELES TUESDAY NIGHT AFTER HAVING A HEART ATTACK. HE WAS LIVING WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE BUT REGULARLY APPEARING AS HIMSELF ON CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM. HE WAS 76 YEARS OLD. >>>. REALLY BUSY DAY TODAY ON CAPITOL HILL AND A LOT OF IT HAPPENING AND CLOSE DOORS WERE HUNTER BIDEN TESTIFIED AS PART OF THE HOUSE REPUBLICANS IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY INTO HIS DAD. THEY WANTED TO KNOW IF PRESIDENT BIDEN WAS LINKED TO HUNTER'S INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS DEALS. BECAUSE THE HEARING WAS CLOSED TO THE PUBLIC, WE DON'T KNOW THE DETAILS OF THE QUESTIONING, BUT NBC NEWS WAS A PART OF THE OPENING STATEMENT WERE HUNTER BIDEN ACCUSED REPUBLICANS UP QUOTE TRAFFICKING WITH INNUENDO, DISTORTION, SENSATIONALISM, WHILE IGNORING THE CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE STARING THEM IN THE FACE. LET'S BRING LEGAL ANALYST ANGELA CENEDELLA- IT IS SO GOOD TO SEE YOU IN PERSON- BEFORE WE GET STARTED. BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW THE DETAILS OF WHAT WAS SAID INSIDE, LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT WAS SET ON THE OUTSIDE FROM THE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN BEFORE THE MEETING STARTED. >>. WITH EACH INTERVIEW, WE LEARN MORE INFORMATION. WE FIND MORE POTENTIAL EVIDENCE THAT NEEDS TO BE OBTAINED, MORE TIPS, ACCUSATIONS THAT NEED TO BE INVESTIGATED. SO, AS LONG AS WE KEEP GETTING NEW INFORMATION, WE WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE. >>. MORE EVIDENCE AND INFORMATION. DO WE KNOW WHAT HE IS TALKING ABOUT? >>. IT DEPENDS YOU ASK, BECAUSE REPUBLICANS SAY THERE IS A TREASURE TROVE OF EVIDENCE AND DEMOCRATS SAY IT IS SMOKE AND MIRRORS. REPUBLICANS HAVE BROUGHT FOR SO FAR THROUGH BANK RECORDS THEY DETERMINED BETWEEN 2014 AND 2019, BIDEN FAMILY MEMBERS RECEIVED $15 MILLION IN BUSINESS DEALS WITH FOREIGN ENTITIES. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE HAS NOT BEEN PROVEN THOSE BUSINESS DEALS WERE LEGAL OR THAT JOE BIDEN HIMSELF TECHNICALLY BENEFITED. THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE SO FAR. MUDDIED A LITTLE BIT IS JOE MUDDIED A LITTLE BIT IS: JOE BIDEN DID NOT MEET THESE PEOPLE BUT IT APPEARS HE DID, MAYBE FOR SOCIAL REASONS. THAT IS THE GAP OPEN FOR THE REPUBLICANS TO CHARGE ORTH. >> WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? >> IT COULD GO ON FOR A REALLY LONG TIME. THERE IS NO TECHNICAL RULING, IT IS ABOUT STRATEGY. RIGHT, NOW IT IS IN THE HOUSE- OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE AND WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE. THEY COULD WRAP UP THE INVESTIGATION AND SEND IT TO THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AT THAT POINT AND HOLD A HEARING OF THEIR OWN AND TAKE A LOOK AND DECIDE WHETHER TO DRAFT ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT. IT IS UNCLEAR. IT WILL GET TO THAT STAGE BECAUSE TO YOUR QUESTION EARLIER. IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE. THEY KEEP DOING THE SUBPOENAS AND HAVING MORE WITNESSES AND POSSIBLY DELAY THIS TO THE ELECTION. >>. WHILE WE HAVE YOU. THE DECISION CAME OUT IN NEW YORK. WHEN IT COMES TO THE TRUMP VERDICT ON HIM HAVING TO PAY, IT LOOKS LIKE HE MAY BE ABLE TO SIT ON BOARDS AND DO BUSINESS IN NEW YORK. CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT? >> IT IS TRICKY. HE HAD THIS HUGE JUDGMENT PUT AGAINST HIM BY JUDGE ARTHUR ENGORON. TRUMP LAWYERS WENT TO APPELLATE JUDGE AND ASKED IF HE COULD ONLY PUT UP $100 MILLION AS A BOND AND NOT PAY THE REST. IT IS MEMORABLE. HIS LAWYERS SAID NOT EVEN. JEFF BEZOS OR ELON MUSK OR DONALD TRUMP HAVE $500 MILLION LAYING AROUND THE POINT. IN ORDER TO HAVE 500 MILLION, THEY WOULD HAVE TO TAKE OUT LOANS, BUT THEY CAN'T DO THAT BECAUSE OF JUDGE ARTHUR ENGORON. I WILL MAKE YOU PAY THE WHOLE AMOUNT, BUT YOU CAN TAKE OUT LOANS, WHICH WOULD ALLOW HIM TO PAY THE FEES AND, IN ADDITION TO THAT, ALLOW YOUR ADULT SONS TO REMAIN AS OWNERS AND OFFICERS OF THE COMPANY UNTIL THE APPELLATE COURT MAKES A DECISION. >> IS THE INTEREST STILL STAND? >> YES. >> IT IS $100,000 A DAY. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. >>>. THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN CELEBRATE LAST NIGHT'S PRIMARY WIN IN MICHIGAN, BUT IT WAS NOT THE EASY SLAMDUNK THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BECAUSE OF THE 100,000 PEOPLE THAT VOTED UNCOMMITTED INSTEAD OF VOTING FOR BIDEN. THEY USED THEIR VOTES TO MAKE A STATEMENT PROTESTING THE BIDEN HANDLING OF THE WAR IN GAZA. >> EVEN, AS A SINGLE ISSUE, THAT ALONE WAS ENOUGH FOR ME NOT TO CIRCLE NEXT TO HIS NAME. >> I VOTE NOT COMMITTED TO SEND A MESSAGE. THERE'S A BIG ENOUGH POPULATION THAT BELIEVES. THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE AND WE WANT TO SEE CERTAIN ACTIONS FROM HIM THAT HE IS NOT DONE UP TO THIS POINT, WHICH IS PERMANENT CEASE-FIRE >>. THE NEXT UP ON THE PRIMARY SCHEDULE IS THE BIG ONE, SUPER TUESDAY, WHICH IS NEXT WEEK. ORGANIZERS OF THE UNCOMMITTED EFFORT ARE LOOKING TO KEEP THE MOMENTUM GOING IN OTHER STATES. SHAQ BREWSTER HAS MORE >>. Reporter. ORGANIZERS FROM MICHIGAN, THE GROUP ORGANIZING THIS PROTEST CAMPAIGN AGAINST PRESIDENT BIDEN, WERE CELEBRATING THE RESULTS OF THE MICHIGAN PRIMARY LAST NIGHT. THEY SAY THEY HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH ORGANIZERS FROM OTHER STATES AND UPCOMING PRIMARY CONTESTS TO SEE IF IT CAN BE REPLICATED DOWN THE LINE. LET'S BE CLEAR. PRESIDENT BIDEN DID HAVE A COMMANDING AND CONVINCING VICTORY IN THE STATE OF MICHIGAN. HE WON EVERY COUNTY IN THE STATE WITH 80% OF THE VOTE WHILE. THAT IS TRUE. IT IS ALSO TRUE. THIS GROUP FEELS AS IF THEY OVER PERFORM, BEAT OUT THEIR OWN METRICS, WIN TWO CITIES ACROSS THE STATE OF MICHIGAN. THE TONE YOU HEARD FROM THEM IN THE PRESS CONFERENCE I HAD EARLIER TODAY IS THAT THEIR CLEAR MESSAGE WAS SENT, SENDING A MESSAGE TO PRESIDENT BIDEN AND DEMOCRATIC PARTY THAT THEY DON'T LIKE WHAT THEY ARE SAYING OVERSEAS. THEY WANT IMMEDIATE CEASE-FIRE BETWEEN ISRAEL AND HAMAS AND THAT, ONGOING WAR, THEY WANT TO CUT OFF UNITED STATES MILITARY SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL MEANWHILE. THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN ACKNOWLEDGE, THE UNCOMMITTED VOTES RECEIVED, THEY SAID, THEY SHARED. THE PRESIDENT SHARES THE SAME GOALS IN TERMS OF HAVING LASTING PEACE IN THE REGION. THE QUESTION IS: THE ULTIMATE TEST LOOKING AHEAD TO THE GENERAL ELECTION WILL BE, WHETHER OR NOT THAT MESSAGE WAS RECEIVED AND WHETHER THERE'S ANY CHANGE THAT CAN BE MADE. THAT WOULD LEAD THOSE 100,000 PEOPLE WHO VOTED AGAINST BIDEN TO FLIP THEIR VOTES AND VOTE FOR HIM IN NOVEMBER. >>> COMING UP: NEW STUDY SHOWS CONNECTION BETWEEN SMOKING WEED AND HEART ATTACKS IN WHAT WILL BE A BUZZ KILL.

WE HAVE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF MEDICINAL POT, BUT A NEW STUDY PUBLISHED TODAY MIGHT MAKE OTHER PEOPLE THINK TWICE ABOUT GOING TO THE DISPENSARY BECAUSE IT FOUND SMOKING, VAPING, SMOKING MARIJUANA IS LINKED TO SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER RISK OF HEART ATTACK AND STROKE, EVEN IF THE PERSON HAD NO PRE-EXISTING HEART CONDITION. THE STUDY AMONG THE LARGEST INITIAL CONNECTION BETWEEN MARIJUANA USE AND HEART HEALTH AND PEOPLE WHO ALSO DON'T SMOKE TOBACCO. JOINING ME TO BREAK THIS DOWN AS NBC NEWS MEDICAL FOLLOW, DR AKSHAY SYAL. DR SYAL, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE BLAZING THESE DAYS. WE HAVE A LOT OF HEART DISEASE. WHAT DO WE KNOW FOR SURE? >>. ON, PEOPLE ARE BLAZING. ONE IN FIVE AMERICANS FROM THE LATEST SURVEY SUGGEST. THEY HAVE USED MARIJUANA IN THE LAST YEAR PICK. NEXT YEAR IT WILL GO UP EVEN MORE. WE THINK SO WHAT IS GOING ON? WE SHOULD BE CONCERNED. I HAVE SPOKEN TO DOZENS OF PEOPLE ABOUT THIS IN THE PAST YEAR. EITHER A FIXED OR MARIJUANA WE ARE NOT AWARE OF BECAUSE. A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK IT IS A PLANT AND NATURAL BENIGN AND LEGAL AT MOST PLACES. THE PEOPLE THINK IT CAN'T HARM ME. WHAT WE'RE LEARNING? IS THERE A LINK EMERGING BETWEEN HEART ATTACK AND STROKE AND EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE HEART DISEASE OR IF YOU DON'T SMOKE CIGARETTES, WITH THE STUDY THEY CAN SEPARATE CIGARETTES FROM THE MARIJUANA. EVEN IF YOU DID NOT SMOKE CIGARETTES, IT COULD CAUSE YOU TO HAVE A HEART ATTACK OR STROKE, OR ASSOCIATE IT WITH THAT HEART ATTACK OR STROKE. WHO NEEDS TO BE CONCERNED? PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING HEART CONDITIONS. EVERYTHING I TALK TO SAYS: IF YOU HAVE HEART DISEASE, DO NOT SMOKE MARIJUANA. >>. HOW DID RESEARCHERS COME UP WITH THIS? PLEASE COHORT, SEPARATING TOBACCO USERS, WHO ALSO USE MARIJUANA, FROM PEOPLE THAT JUST USE MARIJUANA. >>. LOOKED AT CDC DATA FROM 2016 TO 2020, THE COURSE OF FOUR YEARS- 100,000 PEOPLE AT PEOPLE THAT HAD A HEART ATTACK OR STROKE OR HEART DISEASE, AND WHAT ROLE DID MARIJUANA HAVE MOST PEOPLE ADMITTED TO SMOKING? 75% SAID: IF I USE IT, I SMOKE IT. THE MILLION-DOLLAR QUESTION IS: IF I USE EDIBLE, DOES THAT TAKE AWAY RISK EVERYONE? I TALK TO ABOUT THIS. THEORETICALLY, IT SHOULD BE BETTER. IF YOU HAVE TO USE MARIJUANA, TRY TO USE EDIBLES INSTEAD OF SMOKING. BECAUSE OF SMOKING, YOU GET DAMAGE FROM THE THC BUT YOU ALSO GET THAT INHALED SMOKE, WHICH MAY CONTAIN CARCINOGENS, LIKE CIGARETTES >>. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A DIFFERENCE OF EATING IT, INGESTING IT, VERSUS WHAT WE SAW IN THE EARLY DAYS OF TOBACCO, WHICH IS CLEARLY DAMAGE TO THE LUNGS AND HEART SPEECH PENALTY- WHAT A PHARMACIST TOLD ME AT UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO. HE IS WORRIED. WE ARE MAKING THE SAME MISTAKES WE DID WITH CIGARETTE SMOKING BACK IN THE '50s AND '60s. I DID THAT AND IT MIGHT BE BAD, BUT PEOPLE KEPT SMOKING EVEN WITH THE WINDOWS ROLLED UP. WE ARE AT THE POINT WHERE THE SIGNALS EMERGE FOR MARIJUANA AND EVERYBODY I TALK TO SAYS WE NEED TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY, STUDY IT MORE AND FIND OUT MORE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT IT DOES TO THE HEART. >> YOUR SCENT EDIBLES BROWNIES PROBABLY NOT GREAT FOR THE HEART, EITHER. >>.

FOR RETAILERS THAT CAN'T COMPLY THE BILL MANDATES SAY THEY SECURE GIFT CARDS IN A LOCATION ONLY EMPLOYEES CAN ACCESS? >>. ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS GLUE THIS BACK DOWN. >>. Reporter. YOU DON'T THINK THIS IS NOT TO PROTECT THE CONSUMER? >> NOT NEARLY SUFFICIENT. >>. Reporter. POLICE UNION DIRECTOR SAYS, BASED ON EXPERIENCE, HE SUSPECTS THE SCAMS START BEFORE GIFT CARDS GET TO THE STORES. >> IS BACK TO WHERE THE CARD S CREATED, WITH SOMEONE WORKING THERE IS GIVING THE NUMBERS AWAY.

THE UNION LOST THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS WITH KROGER GIFT CARDS THAT WERE DRAINED IMMEDIATELY AFTER ACTIVATED WITH NO SIGNS OF TAMPERING. >>. RESEARCH TELLS US THE NUMBER ON THE BACK OF THE CART, ENTERING THAT INTO A PROGRAM AND THAT PROGRAM CONSTANTLY CHECKS IT TO SEE WHEN IT IS ACTIVATED. AS SOON AS IT IS ACTIVATED, IT CHARGES $98 TO AN AMAZON ACCOUNT. SUMMER PUTS THE MONEY FOR SOMEONE. >>. Reporter. UNION FILED THIS CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT AGAINST KROGER, ALLEGING THE COMPANY FAILED TO TAKE REASONABLE ISSUES TO PROTECT VISA GIFT CARDS AGAINST UNAUTHORIZED TAMPERING AND FAILED TO RESPOND TO THE MISSING BALANCE. KROGER DID NOT REPLY TO REQUESTS FOR COMMENT BUT OFFERED TO REPLACE THE GIFT CARDS. PICK THE RETAIL GIFT CARD ASSOCIATION SAYS IT IS POSSIBLE FOR SCHEMES TO ORIGINATE WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHAIN. HOWEVER, WE HAVE EXTENSIVE CONTROLS AND SOPHISTICATED PROCESSES IN PLACE THAT MAINTAIN THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF SECURITY. CONSIDERING THE GIFT CARD INDUSTRY- TOTAL VOLUME, FRONT MUSCLES ARE RELATIVELY SMALL. WELCOMES ANY ATTEMPT AT MAKING GIFT CARDS MORE SECURE AND WILL NOT BUY ANOTHER.

VICKY NGUYEN WITH NBC NEWS: >>> STILL TO COME. THE POPE HAD TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL TODAY FOR TESTING >>> WELCOME BACK. WE GET INTO >>> WELCOME BACK, WE GET INTO- THE LATEST ON THE CEASE-FIRE NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN ISRAEL AND HAMAS. IN A MOMENT RIGHT. NOW LET'S TAKE A QUICK LOOK AROUND THE WORLD. THE FRENCH SENATE APPROVED HISTORIC BILL TO MAKE ABORTION A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT. FRENCH PRESIDENT MACRON PROMISED IT IN RESPONSE TO ABORTION RIGHTS IN THE UNITED STATES, SAYING HE WANTED THE RIGHT TO ABORTION PROTECTED BY THE CONSTITUTION, SO THAT IT WAS IRREVERSIBLE. THE BILL GOES BEFORE A JOINT SESSION OF THE PARLIAMENT, WHERE IT IS EXPECTED TO PASS. >>>. IN AUSTRALIA 30,000 PEOPLE ORDERED TO EVACUATE THE SOUTHEAST AREA BECAUSE OF INTENSE HEAT WAVE. OFFICIALS BELIEVE COULD CREATE FIRE DANGER'S SO BAD THEY ARE CALLING THEM CATASTROPHIC. HUNDREDS OF FIREFIGHTERS STILL BATTLING THE MASSIVE BLAZE WEST OF MELBOURNE FROM MUSICK, AND THAT FIRE DESTROYED SEVERAL HOMES AND BURNED NEARLY 50,000 ACRES. >>>. CARNIVAL CRUISE SHIP RESCUED A GROUP OF MIGRANTS ON A RAFT 20 MILES NORTH OF CUBA. THIS HAPPENED LAST WEEKEND. THE CRUISE SHIP PAST A GROUP OF 20 MIGRANTS, TURNED BACK TO GET THEM AND CALLED THE US COAST GUARD TO HELP WITH THE RESCUE. AT TIMES LIKE NO ONE WAS HURT AND THE MIGRANTS WILL BE SENT BACK TO CUBA. >>>. THE NUMBER BABIES BORN IN JAPAN LAST YEAR FELL FOR EIGHTH STRAIGHT YEAR IN A ROW, THE LOWEST SINCE THE COUNTRY STARTED KEEPING TRACK IN THE 1980s. THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE GETTING THEIR DROPPED BELOW 500,000 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 90 YEARS. SURVEYS SHOW A LOT OF YOUNGER JAPANESE ARE FRUSTRATED BY HIGH COST OF LIVING AND NOT ENOUGH JOBS. JAPAN'S MINISTER CALLS IT JAPAN'S BIGGEST CRISIS >>>. ISRAEL AND HAMAS SHUTTING DOWN THE IDEA THERE COULD BE A CEASE-FIRE DEAL AS SOON AS AS WE CAN EVEN THOUGH. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT PRESIDENT BIDEN- SECOND HAPPEN BY THE END OF THE WEEK NEGOTIATORS SAY THEY ARE PUSHING HARD FOR A DEAL BEFORE THE START OF RAMADAN, WHICH IS MARCH 10th. THE DEAL WOULD MAKE SURE GAZANS GET THE AID THAT THEY NEED. RIGHT NOW, CHILD MALNUTRITION LEVELS IN GAZA ARE THE WORST IN THE WORLD. AND ALL OF THIS AS ISRAEL IS DOUBLING DOWN ON ITS PLANS TO INVADE ROUGHER. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT RAF SANCHEZ HAS MORE >>. Reporter. AS THE FIGHTING RAGES ON IN GAZA AND THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN THE STRIP DEEPENS, THERE IS REALLY VERY LITTLE EVIDENCE ON THE GROUND TO SUPPORT PRESIDENT BIDEN'S EARLIER OPTIMISM THAT A CEASE-FIRE DEAL AS POSSIBLE BY MONDAY I SPOKE TO ISRAELI OFFICIAL EARLIER TODAY. THEY SAY TALKS AT THIS POINT ARE BASICALLY STALLED. ISRAEL AND THE UNITED STATES ARE WAITING FOR FORMAL RESPONSE FROM THOMAS -- HAMAS WITH THE FRAMEWORK HAMMERED OUT IN PARIS WITH THE CIA DIRECTOR. OVER THE WEEKEND WE SPOKE EARLIER TO SENIOR HAMAS- OFFICIAL THAT CONFIRMED HAMAS IS STILL STUDYING THAT PROPOSAL BUT HE SAYS THERE ARE VERY SIGNIFICANT OBSTACLES GETTING INTO THE WAY OF THE DEAL. AT THIS POINT HE POINTS TO A COUPLE OF THEM. ONE IS THE PERENNIAL QUESTION OF WHETHER A CEASE-FIRE WOULD BE TEMPORARY, WHICH IS WHAT ISRAEL SAYS NEEDS TO HAPPEN. IT WILL RESUME ITS MILITARY CAMPAIGN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF ANY DEAL, OR WHETHER THE CEASE- FIRE WILL BE PERMANENT, WHICH IS WHAT HAMAS WANTS. THEY SAY ANY PAUSE IN FIGHTING MUST LEAD TO PERMANENT INTO THE WAR. THERE'S THIS QUESTION: WHETHER ISRAELI FORCES WILL WITHDRAW FROM POPULATION CENTERS INSIDE OF GAZA DURING THE DEAL, OR WHETHER THEY WILL LEAVE THE GAZA STRIP ALTOGETHER, WHICH IS WHAT HAMAS IS DEMANDING. EVERY DAY THAT GOES BY WITHOUT A DEAL, FEAR IS GROWING FOR THE 134 HOSTAGES STILL BEING HELD BY HAMAS. THERE IS A SPECIAL URGENCY ABOUT GETTING FEMALE HOSTAGES OUT, FOLLOWING TESTIMONY THAT SOME OF THEM MAY BE FACING SEXUAL ABUSE AT THE HANDS OF THEIR CAPTORS. THERE IS ALSO GROWING URGENCY ABOUT THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS INSIDE OF GAZA. THE UN TODAY SAYING A QUARTER OF ALL THE PEOPLE IN GAZA ARE ONE STEP AWAY FROM FAMINE AT THIS POINT, AND THAT BORDERLINE STARVATION, PARTICULARLY CONCENTRATED IN THE NORTH OF GAZA, WERE. THE UN SAYS THAT ISRAELI MILITARY RESTRICTIONS AND COMPLETE COLLAPSE OF LAW AND ORDER MEANS, THAT THEY CAN NO LONGER DELIVER FOOD TO THE NORTH OF THE STRIP. OUR TEAMS IN GAZA HAVE SEEN FAMILIES THAT ARE TRYING TO FEED THEIR CHILDREN WITH FLAKES OF BARLEY INTENDED FOR DONKEYS, THEY SAY. THEY ARE SENDING THEIR KIDS OUT DODGING GUNBATTLES TO TRY TO FIND FIREWOOD BECAUSE THERE IS NO COOKING GAS. AND EVERY DAY, THE FIGHTING CONTINUES, IS ANOTHER DAY, THE CRISIS CONTINUES >>>. POPE FRANCIS WAS HOSPITALIZED TODAY AFTER COMPLICATIONS FROM THE FLU CHIEF. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT KEIR SIMMONS HAS MORE ON HOW THE POPE IS DOING TONIGHT >>. Reporter. THIS WILL WORRY MANY CATHOLICS AROUND AND OTHERS WHO LOVE POPE FRANCIS. THE NEWSY HAS ATTENDED THE HOSPITAL AGAIN TODAY FOR A CT SCAN, ACCORDING TO REPORTS. A QUICK VISIT THAT HAS PEOPLE WORRIED BECAUSE. THAT HAS PEOPLE WORRIED BECAUSE TO HAVE AN 8 -- AIDE SPEAK SAYING HE WAS SUFFERING FROM FLULIKE SYMPTOMS. IN A STATEMENT FROM THE VATICAN SAID, POPE FRANCIS WENT TO THE HOSPITAL FOR SOME DIAGNOSTIC TESTING. AT THE END HE RETURNED TO THE VATICAN. BUT POPE FRANCIS HAS HAD HEALTH COMPLAINTS IN RECENT YEARS. TO IN 2021, HE UNDERWENT ABDOMINAL SURGERY. LATE LAST YEAR HE HAD TO CANCEL THE CLIMATE CONFERENCE, SOMETHING HE VERY MUCH WANTED TO DO, BECAUSE OF RESPIRATORY CHALLENGES. HE APPEARS SICKER THAN. HE APPEARS TO BE REMEMBER. HE IS 87 YEARS OLD AND HAD PART OF A LUNG REMOVED WHEN HE WAS A YOUNG MAN, CONSISTENT CHALLENGES WITH RESPIRATORY ILLNESSES, LIKE THE COLD AND FLU. THIS IS COLD AND FLU SEASON IN ROME. POPE FRANCIS BEING POPE FRANCIS, HAS CONTINUED TO MANY PEOPLE. HE DOES PICK UP BUGS. IT DOES WORRY PEOPLE.

THERE'S A BIG DISCONNECT, OR NOT, WHEN IT COMES TO ACCESS TO CHARGERS. A LOT OF EV DRIVERS COMPLAINT. AMERICA'S CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE IS GETTING WORSE AND NOT KEEPING UP WITH THE RECORD NUMBER EVs ON THE ROAD, WHICH HAS A LOT OF PEOPLE CONSIDERING ALTERNATIVES. NATIONAL CLAIMANT REPORTED. CHASE CAIN HAS THE LATEST >>. Reporter. AMERICANS WITH ELECTRIC VEHICLES LOVE DRIVING THEM >>. I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO GAS >>. Reporter. WHAT THEY DON'T LOVE IS CHARGING THEM. THE LATEST SURVEY SHOWS WIDESPREAD FRUSTRATION. DRIVERS IN CITIES LIKE MIAMI, DALLAS, DENVER, SAN FRANCISCO, STRUGGLE TO FIND WORKING CHARGERS AS OFTEN AS ONE IN EVERY FOUR STOPS HESITATION TO HANG UP THE PUMP. >>. THE CHARGING DROUGHT RIGHT NOW. WERE NOT ABLE TO COME UP WITH A MAP THAT OUT >>. Reporter. ONE IN 10 NEW CAR. SO LAST YEAR WAS ELECTRIC BUT THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION MAY BE PUMPING THE BRAKES. NEW YORK TIMES REPORTING EV MILESTONES FOR AUTOMAKERS MAY BE PUSHED FROM 2026 TO 2032.. AT THE SAME TIME, TRYING TO BUILD A LOT MORE CHARGING- SPEECH DEATH CLEARLY. WE NEED MORE 170,000 CHARGING STATIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THE PRESIDENT'S GOAL IS TO GET A 500,000.. WE THINK WE WILL GET THERE BY 2026. DAY. I THINK THE UNEVENNESS OF THIS WHOLE PUSH WILL EVEN OUT OVER TIME. >>. Reporter. IMPORTANT PUSH BECAUSE INTO THE US. THE BIGGEST SOURCE OF PLANET HEATING EMISSIONS COMES FROM TRANSPORTATION- 29%- AND IT IS THE FASTEST RISING SOURCE. MAYBE YOU HEARD ABOUT ANOTHER WAY TO DRIVE WITHOUT EMISSIONS- WAY TO DRIVE WITHOUT EMISSIONS. SO NO MINING FOR A BIG BATTERY HYDROGEN CELL VEHICLES- WHICH I FIRST REPORTED ON IN 2020 WHILE COVERING THE OLYMPIC GAMES IN TOKYO- THE REALLY COOL THING ABOUT HIM- AND SET OF RE-PUMPED GAS FROM THE TAILPIPE. THE ONLY EXHAUST FROM THESE CARS IS A LITTLE BIT OF WATER FOR NOW IN THE US, ONLY SOLD IN CALIFORNIA WAS 18,000 ON THE ROAD SO FAR- SPEECH EIGHT YEARS NOW I'M NOT GOING BACK. >>. Reporter. THAT HAS TO BE ATTACHED. YEAH, MAKING HYDROGEN FUEL REQUIRES A LOT OF ENERGY, WHICH IS WHY. CHAMPION OF HYDROGEN AT UC IRVINE SAYS PERSONAL CARS HOULD STILL GO ELECTRIC. >>. LIGHT DUTY VEHICLE NOT GOING FAR, YOU SHOULD NOT NEED A BATTERY. BUT IF YOU HAVE HEAVY DUTY, LONG-RANGE OR FAST FEELING REQUIRED HYDROGEN OFFERS. THOSE FEATURES: HYDROGEN 10 D CARBON. NICE THINGS THAT COULD NOT BE TOO THINGS THAT COULD NOT BE TOO URBANIZED. OTHERWISE, EXPECT TO SEE HYDROGEN REPLACING MORE BUSES AND TRUCKS IN THE FUTURE, A LOT MORE ELECTRIC CHARGING STATIONS POPPING UP, THANKS TO A FEDERAL INVESTMENT OF $7.5 BILLION >>. Reporter. IN CALIFORNIA, CLAIMANT REPORTED CHASE CAIN. >>> UPDATE FROM THE MOON. WE GOT NEW IMAGES BEAMED BACK FROM FIRST AMERICAN MADE ROVER TO LAND ON THE LUNAR SURFACE SINCE THE APOLLO MISSION. YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE LANDING GEAR OF ODYSSEUS MAKING CONTACT WITH THE SURFACE OF THE MOON. HERE'S ANOTHER ANGLE: DESPITE ROLLING OVER, SITTING SIDEWAYS. THE COMPANY PARTNERING WITH NASA ON THE MISSION CALLS IT A SUCCESS SO FAR AND RECEIVING DATA AS OF EARLIER TODAY. LET'S BRING DR PAUL SUTTER, ASTROPHYSICIST, AND MASS ADVISE. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE UPDATES WE HAVE SEEN SO FAR? >>. THIS IS A REMARKABLE ACHIEVEMENT. ALL AROUND LANDING ON THE MOON IS INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT, ESPECIALLY DOING IT AUTONOMOUSLY THE LAST 15 MINUTES OR SO. THE SPACECRAFT HAD NO HUMAN INTERVENTION, WHATSOEVER, ONLY ONBOARD YSTEMS IN CHARGE OF GUIDANCE PROPULSION. LANDING IT WAS NOT PERFECT. IT TRIPPED ON A ROCK ON THE WAY DOWN. BUT NOTHING IS PERFECT. THIS IS HOW WE LEARN AND ADAPT, HOW WE SOLVE CHALLENGES. TO MAKE THE NEXT ONE BETTER DAY. I HAVE TO ASK ABOUT THIS: OTHER PIECE OF SPACE NEWS: NASA AIRCRAFT AND SPACE JUNK, DEAD RUSSIAN SATELLITE COMING WITHIN 65 FEET OF EACH OTHER. TALKING ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY LAST WEEK, WHAT YOU THINK OF THAT? >>. THIS IS A REAL PROBLEM. OVER 10,000 SATELLITES IN ORBIT AROUND THE EARTH, 9000 ARE STILL ACTIVE, ANOTHER 25,000, PIECES OF JUNK, LITTLE BITS OF METAL STRUNG AROUND IN ORBIT. THE PROBLEM WITH THIS? THEIR TRAVELING AT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF MILES PER HOUR. THESE TWO SATELLITES, IT ALMOST CRUSHED, WERE NOT STEERABLE. WE COULD NOT AVOID THE COLLISION. IF THEY WERE ON A COLLISION COURSE AND IF THEY WOULD SMASH INTO EACH OTHER, THEY WOULD CREATE A DEBRIS CLOUD THAT WOULD CONTINUE TO ORBIT THE EARTH FOR YEARS, IF NOT DECADES, TO COME POSING A HAZARD TO EVERY OTHER SATELLITE MISSION IN ORBIT AROUND THE EARTH? >>. HOW FAR AWAY DO YOU THINK WE ARE FROM HAVING ORBITAL DUMP TRUCK THAT CAN CLEAN THAT UP. >>. UNFORTUNATELY, THIS IS VERY DIFFICULT CHALLENGE BECAUSE VERY EXPENSIVE. TO GET OBJECTS INTO ORBIT. TO HAVE A DUMP TRUCK ESSENTIALLY MEANS YOU HAVE TO GET THE DUMP TRUCK UP INTO ORBIT AND MANEUVER IT, ATTACH IT TO THE SATELLITE AND EITHER BRING IT DOWN TO THE ATMOSPHERE OR KICK IT WAY UP INTO A MUCH HIGHER ORBIT. ALL OF THAT TAKES ENERGY, ALL OF THAT TAKES PROPELLANT AND USUALLY INVOLVE SACRIFICING THE DUMP TRUCK IN THE MISSION ITSELF. THERE ARE NO EASY SOLUTIONS. THE BEST PATH FORWARD IS FOR GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE COMPANIES TO WORK TOGETHER TO ENSURE THAT ALL MISSIONS, ALL SATELLITES, HAVE A LIFETIME, HAVE A WAY OF THE ORBITING THEMSELVES AT THE END OF THEIR MISSION. >> WE TALK ABOUT DE-ORBITING, TALKING ABOUT A THRUSTER THAT PUSHES IT GENTLY BACK INTO THE ATMOSPHERE TO BRING IT UP. >> EXACTLY, THAT IS EXACTLY IT. PUSH IT INTO THE ATMOSPHERE, WERE BURNED, OR PUSH IT INTO A VERY FAR ORBIT WHERE WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT FOR A LONG TIME. >> MORE THRUSTERS IN SPACE. DR PAUL SUTTER, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. >>>. THAT DOES IT FOR US TONIGHT. I'M GADI SCHWARTZ. WE WILL SEE YOU TOMORROW. UNTIL THEN, STAY TUNED NOW.",[52]

TODAY IS SUPER TUESDAY, WITH VOTING TAKING PLACE IN MORE THAN A DOZEN STATES, AND THAT MEANS MORE THAN ONE THIRD OF ALL DELEGATES WILL BE UP FOR GRABS TODAY. THE REPUBLICAN FRONT RUNNER, DONALD TRUMP, WILL MOVE CLOSER TO BECOMING HIS PARTY'S NOMINE. HIS CHALLENGER, NIKKI HALEY, IS STAYING IN THE RACE EVEN THOUGH. SHE HAS JUST WON ONE CONTEST SO FAR. SHE CAMPAIGNED IN TEXAS YESTERDAY, TELLING VOTERS THAT CASTING A BALLOT IS CRUCIAL. >> COURAGE FOR ME TO RUN AND COURAGE FOR EVERYONE OF YOU TO KNOW. DON'T COMPLAIN ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS IN A GENERAL ELECTION IF YOU DON'T PLAY IN THIS PRIMARY IT MATTERS >>. WE DO HAVE THE RESULTS OF THE FINAL CONTEST. AHEAD OF SUPER TUESDAY, DONALD TRUMP HAS WON THE NORTH DAKOTA REPUBLICAN CAUCUSES INCHING CLOSER TO THE NOMINATION AND BY WINNING MORE THAN 60% OF THE VOTE, TRUMP IS SET TO WIN ALL 29 OF THE STATE'S DELEGATES. >>. WE HAVE TEAM COVERAGE THIS MORNING OF SUPER TUESDAY AT POLLING LOCATIONS IN VIRGINIA AND MASSACHUSETTS. LET'S BEGIN- AND MASSACHUSETTS LET'S BEGIN- WITH MARK MURRAY. TODAY IS THE BIGGEST SINGLE VOTING DAY IN THE PRIMARY SEASON. NEARLY 900 DELEGATES ARE UP FOR GRABS. DELEGATES ARE UP FOR GRABS. WHAT IS AT STAKE HERE TODAY, ESPECIALLY AS HALEY'S CAMPAIGN IS LOOKING FOR ANY KIND OF MOMENTUM AFTER WINNING DC OVER THE WEEKEND. >> THE DELEGATE MATH AND THE REPUBLICAN RACE. 855 DELEGATES ARE UP FOR GRABS AND TONIGHT'S CONTEST AND ON DONALD TRUMP'S NIGHT HE MAY END UP GETTING 800 OUT OF 865 DUE TO MANY OF THE ALLOCATION RULES INEFFECTUALLY WINNER TAKE ALL. IF YOU GET 60% OR MORE FROM THE CONTEST, NIKKI HALEY'S BEST NIGHT, SHE MIGHT BE ABLE TO HOLD DONALD TRUMP TO FEWER THAN 700 DELEGATES, AND THAT JUST KIND OF SHOWS YOU THE SCAPE THAT. EVEN. IF SHE DOES SUPER WELL TONIGHT AND IT EXCEEDS EXPECTATIONS, SHE WILL TRAIL DONALD TRUMP SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE DELEGATE RACE FOR THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION >>. SO PRESIDENT TRUMP IS THE HEAVY FAVORITE TO WIN TODAY. WHAT ARE SOME OF THE RESULTS? YOU >>. >>. MY BASELINE IS ABOUT THE NATIONAL POLLS THAT WE HAVE SEEN IN THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CONTEST AFTER THE SOUTH CAROLINA PRIMARY, WHERE DONALD TRUMP LEADS BY ABOUT 80 POINTS IN AN 80 TO 20 MARGIN. WE WILL SEE IF THAT HOLDS UP. WE WILL SEE IF THAT HOLDS UP TONIGHT. THERE ARE SOME OPEN CATEGORIES THAT ALLOW INDEPENDENTS TO PARTICIPATE. I WILL BE LOOKING FOR SOME STATES, LIKE VIRGINIA OR MASSACHUSETTS, WHERE NIKKI HALEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO OVER PERFORM AND GIVE DONALD TRUMP A CLOSER CONTEST. BUT OVERALL, I THINK THE EXPECTATION IS THAT DONALD TRUMP WILL PROBABLY END UP EMERGING THE AREAS IN ALL OF THE CONTESTS >>. WITH EVERY PASSING DAY, IT LOOKS MORE AND MORE LIKELY THAT WE WILL SEE THIS REMATCH, THIS FALL. RECENT POLLS SHOW MR TRUMP LEADING PRESIDENT BIDEN. SOME OF THOSE POLLS ARE IN THE MARGIN OF ERROR. WILL EITHER CANDIDATE BECOME THE PRESUMPTIVE NOMINEE TONIGHT >>. TECHNICALLY, WE ARE NOT GOING TO GET TO THAT PRESUMPTIVE NOMINEE STAGE, MOST LIKELY UNTIL LATER THIS MONTH. THE MAGIC NUMBER OF THE REPUBLICAN RACE IS 1215 DELEGATES, AND EVEN IF DONALD TRUMP DOES SUPER WELL AND GETS ALMOST ALL OF THE DELEGATES, HE IS NOT GOING TO COME CLOSE TO THAT NUMBER. HE WILL IN THE WEEKS AHEAD HOWEVER. EFFECTIVELY, WE HAVE BEEN IN THIS STAGE HEADING TOWARD THE INEVITABLE DONALD TRUMP VERSUS JOE BIDEN SHOWDOWN, AND WE GET TO THAT STAGE LATER THIS MONTH. >>>. FOR A PERSPECTIVE FROM VOTERS, LET'S BRING IN NBC NEWS POLITICAL REPORTER FROM MASSACHUSETTS. VIRGINIA HAS THIS OPEN PRIMARY AND THAT MEANS VOTERS DON'T HAVE TO BE REGISTERED AS A REPUBLICAN TO VOTE IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY. IS THAT EXPECTED TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE RESULTS THERE >>? GOOD MORNING. VOTERS ARE VOTING IN THE COMMONWEALTH. HOLES HAVE BEEN OPEN FOR ABOUT AN HOUR, AND VOTERS HERE IN VIRGINIA TEND TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO SURPRISE THE WITH THEIR VOTE. THINK BACK TO 2021, WHEN YOUNGKIN ENDED UP IN THE GOVERNORSHIP. HERE IN VIRGINIA, WE ARE LOOKING AT TWO PLACES. FIRST, AMONG INDEPENDENTS. WHERE DID THE SWING VOTERS? WHERE DO THESE INDEPENDENTS END UP? BECAUSE IT IS AN OPEN PRIMARY. THEY WALK INTO THE BUILDING BEHIND ME AND THEY CHOOSE REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT, AND THEY CAN BE ANY PARTY THEY WANT. THEY CAN PICK THEIR CANDIDATE. THE OTHER IS GOING TO BE AMONG DEMOCRATS. DEMOCRATS DON'T HAVE TO VOTE FOR JOE BIDEN TONIGHT. THEY CAN VOTE FOR NIKKI HALEY OR DONALD TRUMP OR A WRITE-IN CANDIDATE AS WELL >>. GARY, YOU ARE IN A SPOT WHERE FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS NOT DONE PARTICULARLY WELL OVER THE YEARS. WHAT ARE YOU HEARING FROM VOTERS TODAY? >>. WE ARE LITTLE BIT NORTH OF THE STATE CAPITOL OF RICHMOND HERE IN VIRGINIA, AND WE HAVE HEARD FROM ALL THREE SIDES OF THE TICKET. WE HAVE HEARD FROM NIKKI HALEY VOTERS, DONALD TRUMP VOTERS AND FROM JOE BIDEN VOTERS AS WELL. WHAT YOU'RE HEARING LINES UP. NIKKI HALEY VOTERS SAY THEY WANT TO RETURN TO NORMAL AND GOVERNORSHIP AND HOW IT WORKS THERE. DONALD TRUMP VOTERS TELL ME THEY DON'T BELIEVE THE ELECTION IN 2020 WAS ACCURATE OR FAIR, AND THEY WANT TO SEE IT BECOME FAIR. AND THEY WANT TO SEE THE ECONOMY GET BETTER. JOE BIDEN'S VOTERS SAY THEY LIKE WHAT THEY HAVE SEEN SO FAR AND THEY WANT TO SEE MORE. >>. YOU WERE ON THE PRODUCING TEAM OF THE SHOW AND NOW YOU ARE ON THE SHOW. 63% OF VOTERS ARE UNENROLLED AND CAN VOTE IN EITHER PRIMARY. THIS GROUP IS A HUGE TARGET FOR NIKKI HALEY AND POTENTIALLY A HUGE OPPORTUNITY FOR HER. WHAT ARE YOU HEARING ON THE GROUND FROM HER? >>. Reporter. 63% IS KEY FOR NIKKI HALEY, BECAUSE HERE IN MASSACHUSETTS, ONLY APPROXIMATELY 8% ARE REGISTERED REPUBLICANS. THE HALEY TEAM IS LOOKING AT THAT. THE DOSE. 63% AND HOPING PEOPLE WILL VOTE IN THE PRIMARY CYCLE, WHICH IS THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY. THERE IS A CAVEAT. IF YOU ARE, THERE IS A CAVEAT. IF YOU ARE UNENROLLED IN MASSACHUSETTS, YOU ARE NOT NECESSARILY GOING TO BE VOTING IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY, AS I HAVE BEEN SPEAKING TO PEOPLE IN THE STATE. A LOT OF THEM TELL ME THEY WILL EITHER BE VOTING FOR TRUMP OR JOE BIDEN, AND THAT SHOWS THE LEVEL OF ADVOCACY THAT VOTERS HAVE TOWARD WHAT THEY SEE AS THE INEVITABLE WHICH IS TRUMP VERSUS BIDEN REMATCH. ONE THING I WILL POINT OUT IS THAT THE NIKKI HALEY BORDERS -- VOTERS I HAVE BEEN SPEAKING TO- DO NOT WANT TO SEE A TRUMP VERSUS BIDEN REMATCH, AND TELL ME IF IT COMES TO IT THEY WILL DO ONE OF THREE THINGS: DO THE TOP OF THE TICKET LINK RIGHT IN HALEY'S NAME OR VOTE FOR A THIRD PARTY. >>. WHAT SEEMS TO BE ON VOTERS MINDS WHEN IT COMES TO ISSUES AS THEY LOOK AHEAD TO THE NOVEMBER BALLOT >>. Reporter. WHEN I TALKED TO VOTERS IN MASSACHUSETTS- REPUBLICAN VOTERS- THE NUMBER 1 ISSUE- I AM HEARING TIME AND TIME AGAIN- IS IMMIGRATION. YOU MIGHT BE THINKING THAT MASSACHUSETTS IS PRETTY FAR FROM THE SOUTHERN BORDER, AND THAT IS TRUE GEOGRAPHICALLY. HOWEVER, MASSACHUSETTS IS HOME TO A NUMBER OF SANCTUARY CITIE MIGRANTS. DIRECTLY IMPACT MASSACHUSETTS STATE: 63% THAT MAY BE CHOOSING TO VOTE IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY. IT IS A REFERENDUM AGAINST THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION IMMIGRATION POLICY >>. THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH. AND WE WILL HAVE COVERAGE OF SUPER TUESDAY ON NBC NEWS NOW, AND OUR EXTENT OF LIVE COVERAGE GETS UNDERWAY SOON. >>>. NOW TO A SUPREME COURT RULING THAT IS HAVING A MAJOR IMPACT ON SUPER TUESDAY, SPECIFICALLY COLORADO. THE SUPREME COURT STATE OBJECTED TO COLORADO -- THAT REVERSES THE COLORADO SUPREME COURT RULING WHICH DETERMINED THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP COULD NOT SERVE AS PRESIDENT AGAIN BECAUSE HE WAS PART OF AN INSURRECTION. >>. THIS IS A VICTORY FOR NOT ONLY COLORADO BUT TWO OTHER STATES THAT HAVE MOVED TO STRIKE HIM FROM THE BALLOT. >>. THE US SUPREME COURT DEALING A FINAL BLOW TO STATES TRYING TO BAN FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP FROM THE BALLOT IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION. THE JUSTICES LEAVING IT UP TO VOTERS TO DECIDE IF THE FORMER PRESIDENT RETURNS TO THE WHITE HOUSE. MR TRUMP IS PRAISING THE RULING. >>. THE VOTERS CAN TAKE SOMEONE OUT OF THE RACE VERY QUICKLY, BUT THE COURT SHOULD NOT BE DOING THAT >>. Reporter. FINDING MR TRUMP IS INELIGIBLE UNDER SECTION 3 OF THE 14th AMENDMENT, A LARGELY UNTESTED CLAUSE OF THE CONSTITUTION PASSED AFTER THE CIVIL WAR, DISQUALIFYING THOSE WHO ENGAGE IN INSURRECTION FROM HOLDING PUBLIC OFFICE AGAIN AND ELECTION OFFICIAL NAMED. AND A JUDGE IN ILLINOIS LATER DOING THE SAME, BANNING THE REPUBLICAN FRONT RUNNER FROM RUNNING ON THE BALLOT. THE RULING FROM THE HIGH COURT NOW ENDING ALL SIMILAR EFFORTS TO DISQUALIFY MR TRUMP FROM THE BALLOT. >>. WHILE MOST STATES WERE THRILLED, THERE WERE SOME THAT THRILLED, THERE WERE SOME THAT WERE NOT >>. Reporter. THE JUSTICES, SING THAT PATCHWORK OF DIFFERENT RULING ACROSS THE COUNTRY, CANNOT STAND FINDING. RESPONSIBILITY FOR ENFORCING SECTION 3 AGAINST FEDERAL OFFICEHOLDERS REST WITH CONGRESS AND NOT THE STATE. AT THE SAME TIME, THE THREE LIBERAL JUSTICES ACCUSING THEIR CONSERVATIVE COLLEAGUES OF GOING TOO FAR BY RULING CONGRESS MUST ENACT NEW LEGISLATION IN ORDER TO BAN A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE. WRITING THIS WOMAN WILL MAKE IT HARDER TO BAR. INSURRECTION IS FROM BECOMING PRESIDENT. CAUTIONING THIS COURT SHOULD TURN THE NATIONAL TEMPERATURE DOWN, NOT UP. >>. THE DECISION WITH THE COURTS MOST IMPORTANT RULING CONCERNING A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. THAT IS WHEN THE COURT RULED IN BUSH'S FAVOR, IN BUSH VERSUS GORE, WHICH VIOLATED THE EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE BY USING DIFFERENT STANDARDS DURING THE BALLOT RECOUNT, GIVING BUSH FLORIDA'S ELECTORAL VOTE FOR PRESIDENT. >>>. THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT IS TEMPORARILY BLOCKING A CONTROVERSIAL IMMIGRATION LAW THAT WAS SENT TO TAKE PLACE IN TEXAS. THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION SENT TO STOP THE LAW, KNOWN AS AS THE -- S B 4.. TEXAS ARGUED THE LAW WAS LEGAL UNDER THE STATE CLAUSE AND ALSO NEEDED BECAUSE THE LEADERSHIP BELIEVES IT IS EFFECTIVELY BATTLING AN INVASION AT THE PUBLIC ORDER. THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION ARGUES THAT A SURGE OF UNAUTHORIZED IMMIGRATION IS NOT THE SAME AS AN INVASION. THE LAW IS SET TO TAKE LACE ON MARCH 10th, BUT THE RULING UNTIL MARCH 13th GIVEN ALL NINE JUSTICES MORE TIME TO DETERMINE WHAT NEXT STEPS TO TAKE. >>>. THE LATEST ROUND OF CEASE- FIRE TALKS, AIMED AT HALTING THE WAR IN GAZA AND RELEASING HOSTAGES, HAS ENDED WITHOUT A BREAK THROUGH. >>. THE NEGOTIATIONS IN CAIRO INVOLVES HAMAS AND INTERNATIONAL MEDIATORS BUT NO ISRAELI DELEGATION ATTENDED. THE UNITED STATES AND OTHERS ARE PUSHING TO SECURE A DEAL BEFORE RAMADAN STARTS THIS WEEKEND. >>. MATT BRADLEY JOINS US NOW. WE, UNDERSTAND, THE TALKS HAVE BROKEN UP AND THERE IS NO DEAL. YET WHAT WERE THE MAJOR STICKING POINTS? >>. Reporter, A NEW DEAL, AND I THINK THAT EVERYONE IS PROBABLY DISAPPOINTED, BUT PROBABLY NOT SURPRISED, BECAUSE THIS IS CERTAINLY NOT THE FIRST FALSE START SINCE THE LAST ROUND OF NEGOTIATIONS TO RELEASE HOSTAGES AND PRISONERS EVER SINCE NOVEMBER, WHEN WE SAW A WEEKLONG BUZZ OF PRISONERS RELEASED. A LOT OF THOSE YOU ARE ASKING ABOUT ARE THE SAME ONES THAT HAVE RESISTED IN THE PAST MONTHS OF NEGOTIATION. >>. ISRAEL DID NOT ATTEND AND REASON WHY. ISRAEL SAYS THEY NEED A DEMAND ANSWERED FROM HAMAS, A SPECIFIC DEMAND WHICH IS ACTUALLY SORT OF NEW SAYING. THEY WANT A LIST OF ALL OF THE HOSPITAL JUST THAT ARE STILL ALIVE. THEY WANT TO KNOW WHO THEY ARE NEGOTIATING FOR AND WHETHER OR NOT THE PEOPLE ARE ALIVE OR DEAD. THERE ARE CURRENTLY 100 HOSTAGES, INCLUDING SIX AMERICANS, SO THIS IS A BIG PART OF THE NEGOTIATION. A LOT OF THE HOSTAGES HAVE BEEN KILLED. 1/5 HAVE BEEN KILLED, AND IT IS NOT CLEAR ENTIRELY WHY SOME HAVE SUCCUMBED TO THEIR WOUNDS. THEY SUSTAINED ON OCTOBER 7th AND OTHERS WERE LIKELY KILLED IN ISRAELI ATTACKS ON THE GAZA STRIP- THE SAME FORCE THAT HAS KILLED MORE THAN 30,000 PEOPLE, ACCORDING TO THE GAZA MINISTRY OF HEALTH. THESE ISSUES ARE STILL PERSISTENT BECAUSE BOTH SIDES ARE STILL SO FAR APART. HAMAS WANTS A RELEASE OF ALL PRISONERS AND A CEASE-FIRE. SOMETHING THAT IS REAL, HAS SAID, IS A NONSTARTER GAZA SAYING: THOSE DEMANDS ARE LUDICROUS >>. THE IMAGES SHOW THE CONDITIONS ARE JUST DETERIORATING DAY BY DAY. THE UNITED STATES AGENCY AT THE FOREFRONT OF RELEASE WORK IN GAZA AND THE STARVATION THAT IS STARTING TO HAPPEN. THERE IS CONTROVERSY. THERE IS CONTROVERSY AFTER ISRAEL ACCUSED THEM OF OPERATIVES FROM HAMAS AND OTHER TERRORIST GROUPS. THE UN SAYS IT IS WAITING TO RECEIVE EVIDENCE ON THE ALLEGATIONS. BUT YESTERDAY WE HEARD FROM THE CHIEF ABOUT ALL OF THIS >>. HE WAS BASICALLY COMPLAINING AND SAYING THE SAME THINGS HE HAS BEEN SAYING FOR THE LAST FEW MONTHS. WITHOUT THIS FUNDING, THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE WILL SUFFER, EVEN THOUGH THIS ORGANIZATION HAS ANNOUNCED THEY WILL COMPLY WITH THE ISRAELI INVESTIGATION INTO HAMAS' ROLE, INTO THE ORGANIZATION. AT THE SAME TIME, DON'T LET THE ENTIRE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE SUFFER BECAUSE OF THIS ISSUE, AS YOU MENTIONED. WE HEARD FROM THE HEAD, AND HERE IS WHAT HE HAD TO SAY: >> WITHOUT ADDITIONAL FUNDING, WE WILL BE ON CHOPPY TERRITORY. WITH SERIOUS INDICATIONS FOR, WITH SERIOUS INDICATIONS FOR GLOBAL PEACE, THE FIT OF THE AGENCY IN THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WOULD DEPEND ON IT HANGING IN THE BALANCE, FACING THE DELIBERATE AND CONSERVATIVE TO UNDERMINE ITS OPERATIONS AND ULTIMATELY END THEM >>. ALL OF THIS IS COUNTING DOWN TO ISRAEL'S ASSAULT ON THE SOUTHERNMOST TOWN AND CITY IN THE GAZA STRIP. OTHER AGENCIES AND OTHER COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS HAVE ALL WARNED THAT IF THIS ATTACK, WHERE THE FINAL REMNANTS OF HAMAS ARE LIVING, IT COULD CREATE WHAT THEY ARE SAYING IS A HUMANITARIAN CATASTROPHE. IN THAT CASE, FUNDING WILL BE NEEDED MORE THAN EVER >>>. YESTERDAY WE REPORTED ON VICE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH. TODAY HAS SOME EXCLUSIVE REPORTING ON HOW OFFICIALS HAVE ACTUALLY WATERED DOWN PARTS OF THAT SPEECH WHICH WERE ESPECIALLY CRITICAL OF ISRAEL. WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THAT? >>. IT WAS INTERESTING BECAUSE THIS WAS DONE WITH THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL AND FROM OUR OWN REPORTING, FROM MY COLLEAGUES IN WASHINGTON SAYING THIS WASN'T A SUBSTANTIVE SHIFT, THAT THIS BILL WAS IMPOSED UPON KAMALA HARRIS'S SPEECH. THERE WAS NO POLICY CHANGE, NOTHING. THAT YOU ARE GOING TO ANNOUNCE ABOUT AMERICAN POSTURE TOWARD ISRAEL, THAT THEY NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL WALKED BACK. BUT IT DOES GO TO SHOW THAT KAMALA HARRIS HAD A MORE FORCEFUL TONE IN MIND AGAINST ISRAEL AND THAT THE UNITED STATES, WHICH HAS BEEN FALLING OUT WITH BENJAMIN NETANYAHU OVER THE LAST MONTHS, DECIDED TO BRING THAT IN JUST A LITTLE BIT. WHETHER OR NOT, THE THINKING IS TO KEEP ISRAEL ON SIDE. THIS IS PART OF A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WASHINGTON AND ISRAEL AND ONE THAT WE WILL SEE CONTINUE TO EVOLVE OVER THE COMING MONTHS >>>. LET'S GET TO THE WEATHER. THERE IS A SOGGY WEEK IN STORE. THERE IS A SOGGY WEEK IN STORE FOR THE COAST >>. WE'VE GOT SO RAIN IN THE FORECAST AND THIS IS WHAT WE WILL BE WATCHING OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. YOUR SATELLITE AND RADAR SHOWING A COUPLE OF SPOTS. ONE IN THE NORTHEAST, WASHINGTON DC- TO NEW YORK. A LITTLE SOGGY THIS MORNING. RAIN WORKING ACROSS PARTS OF THE MIDWEST, WORKING EAST AS THE DAY GOES ON DOWN ALONG THE GULF COAST AND PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHERN PLAINS, MOORE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS THAT WE ARE TRACKING THROUGH THE DAY TODAY. PARTS OF THE NORTHEAST, WASHINGTON, PHILADELPHIA AND NEW YORK WILL BE A LITTLE WET THIS MORNING. HE WILL NEED MORE TIME FOR YOUR MORNING COMMUTE. THAT IS BRINGING THE RAIN ACROSS THAT REGION THIS MORNING, AS WE LOOK OFF TO THE AREAS OF THE MIDWEST AND PARTS OF THE SOUTH, WE HAVE A COLD FRONT THAT IS LEAVING US WITH UNSETTLED WEATHER. THIS WILL MOVE TO THE EAST AS WE GO THROUGH THE DAY. TODAY, THE COASTAL LOW WILL BE OUT OF HERE BUT LOOK AT THIS BIG PUSH OF MOISTURE. THIS MEANS HEAVY RAIN ON THE TABLE FOR FOLKS FROM NORTH CAROLINA TO BASICALLY MAINTAIN, IMPRESSIVE RAINFALL RATES AND FLASH FLOODING ACROSS THE MID-ATLANTIC AND THE NORTHEAST. THURSDAY: WE ARE NOT DONE WITH THE RAIN. I THINK WE COULD SEE A LITTLE BIT OF THE SNOW, A WINTRY MIX MIXING INTO AREAS OF NEW ENGLAND, BUT IT IS GOING TO BE ANOTHER DAY WHERE IT IS UNSETTLED. I MENTIONED LAST -- FLASH FLOODING FOR BOSTON, NEW YORK, PHILADELPHIA AND SOME OF THAT ISOLATED FLASH FLOODING IN THE URBAN AREAS AS WE GET THROUGH. THURSDAY: POTENTIAL WIDESPREAD AMOUNTS OF AN INCH OR TWO INCHES OF RAIN IS EXPECTED ANYWHERE. FROM FOUR INCHES OF RAIN IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, THE UMBRELLA WILL BE GOOD ADVICE FOR NOT JUST TODAY BUT THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. >>. IT IS TOO COLD FOR JUST A RAIN. JACKET, I GET CONFUSED. >>>. LATER THIS HOUR, ON TRIAL, THE FATHER OF THE SCHOOL SHOOTER, ETHAN CRUMLEY, FACING CHARGES OF HIS OWN. WE WILL BREAK DOWN THE CASE AS JURY SELECTION GETS UNDERWAY. >>>. FIRST CHINA'S BIGGEST POLITICAL EVENT OF THE YEAR. IT COMES WITH AN UNEXPECTED >>>. WE ARE BACK WITH CHINA AS >>>. WE ARE BACK WITH CHINA AS THE COUNTRY GATHERS FOR THE BIGGEST POLITICAL EVENT OF THE YEAR, KNOWN AS THE TWO SESSION, WHERE OFFICIALS AND POLITICAL ADVISORS OF THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY GATHER FOR TWO ANNUAL MEETINGS. SIMULTANEOUSLY, LEADERS USE THE WEEKLONG MEETINGS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SIGNAL THEIR PLANS FOR THE COMING YEAR. >>. A FEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR JOURNALISTS TO QUESTION LEADERS BUT FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE COUNTRY'S PREMIER WILL NOT TALK TO REPORTERS AT THE CLOSE OF THE MEETING. >>. THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT HAS DECLARED THE COMMITMENT TO TRANSPARENCY BUT THEY ARE STRAPPING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR REPORTERS TO SPEAK WITH CHINESE OFFICIALS. HOW ARE PEOPLE REACTING AND WHAT DOES THIS TELL US ABOUT THE PRESIDENT? >>. THERE'S A LOT OF SURPRISE AND A LOT OF QUESTIONS AROUND THIS MOVE, WHICH TAKES A FAMOUSLY OPAQUE SYSTEM AND MAKES IT EVEN MORE OF A BLACK BOX, BECAUSE IT IS HAPPENING AT A TIME WHEN FOREIGN POLICYMAKERS AND INVESTORS AROUND THE WORLD ARE LOOKING TO CHINA FOR SOME SORT OF SIGNAL ON WHERE THE ECONOMY IS HEADING. PREMIER IS THE COUNTRY'S TOP ECONOMIC OFFICIAL. IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY THAT HE NOW DOESN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT, AND IT ALSO IS A TRADITION THAT ACCOMPANY THE ERA OF REFORMS AND OPENING UP THE NEWS. CONFERENCE HAS HAPPENED FOR DECADES, AND ONE OF THE FEW OPPORTUNITIES WHERE PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO SEE THE TOP-RANKED OFFICIAL PUBLICLY TALKING ABOUT THE STATES AFFAIRS AND A MISSED OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD HIS PUBLIC PROFILE. BUT THE RECENT SPECULATION THAT THAT COULD PART OF THE REASON. >>. IT COULD BE THAT CHINA IS STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW. OBSERVERS AROUND THE WORLD WERE WATCHING TO SEE WHAT ACTION THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT WILL TAKE TO SUPPORT THE ECONOMY. WHAT ARE THEY SAYING? >>. THEY ARE NOT SAYING MUCH ON WHERE THE ECONOMY IS HEADING. THE GROWTH TARGETS FOR CHINA'S ECONOMY HAS BEEN SET AT 5%, WHICH SEEMS AMBITIOUS, AND THERE WERE NO STIMULUS MEASURES THAT A COMPANY THAT GROWS TARGETS HE DID ACKNOWLEDGE. THERE ARE RISKS AHEAD, THAT THERE ARE DIFFICULTIES IN TRYING TO CREATE JOBS, BUT NO BOLD MOVES THAT THE BUSINESS SECTOR WAS LOOKING FOR TO ANSWER HOW IT IS THAT CHINA IS GOING TO DEAL WITH A PROPERTY CRISIS, A SLUMP IN CONSUMER SPENDING, INFLATIO, ALL OF THESE THINGS THAT ARE TROUBLING THE ECONOMY, WHICH OF COURSE MATTERS TO THE UNITED STATES AND THE ECONOMIES AROUND THE WORLD, BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF CHINA'S ECONOMY. >> THERE'S BEEN A LOT. THE CURRENT FORMER MINISTER CONSIDERED AN INTERIM MINISTER. WHAT CAN WE? >>? >> THERE WAS A LOT OF SPECULATION THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME ANNOUNCEMENT OR UNVEILING OF A NEW FOREIGN MINISTER. YOU WILL REMEMBER THAT HE WAS ABRUPTLY FIRED AND IT REALLY KICKED OFF A LOT OF RUMORS, BECAUSE HE WAS WIDELY CONSIDERED PART OF THE CAMPAIGN'S INNER CIRCLE. FOR NOW HE IS HOLDING THE POSITION AGAIN, AND HE IS DOING SO IN ADDITION TO HIS JOB AS THE COUNTRY'S TOP DIPLOMAT. AND, FROM ALL OF THE SIGNALS OR COMMENTS THAT CAME OUT OF THE PRECINCT YESTERDAY, IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THEY ARE GOING TO BE ANNOUNCING A FOREIGN MINISTER AFTER THE SESSION, OR ANYTIME IN THE NEAR FUTURE. THE FRONT-RUNNER IS CONSIDERED TO BE A MAN. HE STARTED AS A TRANSLATOR AND WORKED HIS WAY UP THROUGH THE RANKS, AND HE IS ALREADY DOING A LOT OF THE DIPLOMATIC FOOTWORK BUT HAS NOT QUITE BEEN ANOINTED YET. HE WILL BE CONDUCTING THE FOREIGN MINISTERS NEWS CONFERENCE FOR THESE POLITICAL MEETINGS BEFORE THE END OF THE WEEK. >>>. HAITI IS UNDER A STATE OF EMERGENCY. THIS MORNING, AFTER A MASS JAILBREAK OVER THE WEEKEND, ARMED GANG MEMBERS STORMED THE LARGEST JAIL AND FREED THOUSANDS. NOW THEY ARE TRYING TO SEIZE CONTROL OF HAITI'S LARGEST INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT. ELLISON BARBER HAS MORE >>. Reporter: HAITI SPIRALING TOWARD ANARCHY- THE 72-HOUR STATE OF EMERGENCY DECLARED AFTER ARMED GANGS STORMED TWO OF THE NATION'S LARGEST PRISONS ON SATURDAY AND SUNDAY. ACCORDING TO THE SUNDAY, ACCORDING TO THE GOVERNMENT- CLOSE TO 4000 PRISONERS REPORTEDLY ESCAPED DURING THE VIOLENT ASSAULT. THE EXACT DEATH TOLL IS UNKNOWN, BUT BODIES WERE SEEN LINING THE STREETS OF PORT-au-PRINCE AS POLICE PUBLICLY PLEADED FOR BACKUP. THE ASSOCIATED PRESS REPORTING HEAVILY ON GANGS TRYING TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE LARGEST INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, EXCHANGING GUNFIRE WITH SOLDIERS EXCHANGING GUNFIRE WITH SOLDIERS NOW CONTROLLING 80% OF THE NATIONAL KITTY -- ONE OF THEIR TARGETS. HELPING WITH SEVERAL HIGH-PROFILE INMATES, INCLUDING WORKING -- COLUMBUS -- COLOMBIAN NATIONALS. PERFECT GANG LEADERS, LIKE JIMMY, WHO IS KNOWN AS BARBECUE, HAS BEEN CALLING FOR THE ARREST OF THE ACTING PRESIDENT. FOR MONTHS, BARBECUE DOUBLE DOWN, FOLLOWING THE PRISON ATTACKS, RELEASING A PUBLIC MESSAGE TELLING HAITIANS THE GANGS QUOTE- SEEK TO LIBERATE THE COUNTRY. HE WAS OUT OF THE COUNTRY AT THE TIME, WORKING WITH LEADERS TO FINALIZE AN AGREEMENT THAT WOULD FAST-TRACK FOR A UN APPROVED MISSION AIMED AT REGAINING CONTROL OF THE NATION. VIOLENCE IN HAITI IS NOT NEW, BUT IT IS STEADILY ESCALATING. LAST YEAR, THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE KILLED IN ARMED GANG CONFLICTS WAS TWO TIMES HIGHER THAN THE YEAR BEFORE. >>. TRAPPED WITH A GOVERNMENT THAT DOESN'T GOVERN, INCAPABLE OF DOING ANYTHING, IT LOOKS LIKE THE GANGS, WHICH ARE THE ONLY ONE THAT CAN ESTABLISH ANY KIND OF POLITICAL ORDER IN HAITI, ARE COMING TOGETHER. >>. Reporter FOR THE RESIDENTS OF PORT-au-PRINCE HELPED CANNOT COME THROUGH THE NIGHT. >>. THANKS TO ELLISON BARBER FOR THAT REPORT. THE STATE DEPARTMENT IS MONITORING AND IS URGING UNITED STATES CITIZENS INSIDE OF HAITI TO LEAVE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. >>> JURY SELECTIONS. IN THE TRIAL OF THE SCHOOL SHOOTER -- THE FATHER OF THE SCHOOL SHOOTER. THIS CASE COULD SET A NEW PRECEDENT IN AMERICA. >>> WE ARE GOING TO BRING DOWN THE SYMPTOMS OF SOMETHING CALLED WEEKDAYS AT 7:00.. >>> THE FIRE HAS GROWN BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS. >>. WHAT YOU SEE BEHIND ME IS TYPICAL. >> HOW ARE YOU DOING? >> PRETTY, PRETTY, BAD. >>>. LAST, A MICHIGAN JURY FOUND HIS MOTHER GUILTY OF INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER. PROSECUTORS ACCUSED JAMES CRUMLEY OF FAILURE TO PROPERLY STORE HIS FIREARM AND PROVIDE REASONABLE CARE FOR HIS SON. HE IS CHARGED WITH FOUR COUNTS OF INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER >>. LAWYERS SAY NEGLIGENCE ALLOWED HIS SONS ACCESS TO THE GUN. CRUMLEY HAS PLEADED, NOT UILTY. HIS MOTHER IS CURRENTLY AWAITING, SENTENCING AND FACES UP TO 15 YEARS IN PRISON, WHILE ETHAN CRUMLEY IS FACING LIFE IN PRISON. >>. DANNY IS HERE WITH MORE OF WHAT TO. >> WALK US THROUGH. JURY SELECTION. WHAT KIND OF QUESTIONS DO YOU THINK THIS GROUP WILL ASK? >>. Reporter. THIS IS A VERY SUBURBAN COUNTY. IT'S GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE BUT THERE ARE NO -- IS NO- MAIN CITY FOR THE COUNTY. THERE ARE A LOT OF GUNOWNERS AND A LOT OF HUNTERS. THESE ARE FOLKS THAT WILL BE FAMILIAR MOSTLY, AND THEY WILL HAVE A CLOSE FAMILY RELATIVE WHO HAS A FIREARM. IT MAY BE A SHOTGUN, A BLUNDERBUSS, A PISTOL- IT IS HARD TO SAY, BUT IN A COMMUNITY WITH A LOT OF HUNTERS YOU DO NOT WANT GUNOWNERS ON THIS JURY. IF YOU ARE THE DEFENSE, THAT MAY SOUND COUNTERINTUITIVE, BUT I FIND THAT THERE IS NO HARSHER CRITIC OF GUN OWNERS THAN LAWFUL GUNOWNERS. >>. AS MENTIONED, JENNIFER CRUMLEY FOUND GUILTY ON ALL FOUR COUNTS. JAMES IS NOW FACING THE EXACT SAME CHARGES AND THE FACTS, EXCEPT FOR THIS ADDED ALLEGATION THAT JAMES BOUGHT THE GUN WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR STORING THE GUN. WHAT ARE YOU KIND OF TAKING AWAY FROM WHAT WE SAW WITH JENNIFER CRUMLEY? HOW DO THESE CASES COMPARE? >>. WE HAVE LEARNED SOME FASCINATING THINGS AFTER THE FIRST CRUMLEY TRIAL ENDED AND ONE OF THE FOUR PERSONS MADE THE GROUNDS IMMEDIATE. THE GROUNDS IMMEDIATE. ANYTHING YOU THINK THE JURY IS FOCUSING ON. THEY MAY BE FOCUSING ON SOMETHING ENTIRELY DIFFERENT, AND MOM WAS THE ONE WITH THE LAST ACCESS TO THE GUN, WHICH WAS AN INSIGNIFICANT FACTOR. BUT YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT THE JURY WILL FOCUS ON. MAYBE YOU TAKE FROM THAT THAT YOU FOCUS ON BLAMING THE MOM, FOCUS ON BLAMING SCHOOL OFFICIALS AND FOCUS ON BLAMING YOUR SON, AND MAYBE YOU WILL SEE THEM DO THAT MORE STRIDENTLY. HERE THEY DID A SOFTER VERSION WITH THE MOTHER'S TRIAL. YOU MAY SEE THEM COME OUT REALLY FOCUSING ON BLAMING OTHERS- THIRD PARTIES- FOR THIS SHOOTING, OF WHICH THERE ARE SEVERAL- YOU HAVE THE MOM AND THE SHOOTER HIMSELF. >>. ARE THERE STRATEGIES THAT DEFENSE CAN USE FOR JAMES? THAT MAYBE WERE NOT AN OPTION FOR JENNIFER? >>. Reporter. YES, FOR EXAMPLE, JAMES MIGHT FOCUS ON THE FACT THAT MOM WAS THE LAST PERSON WITH ACCESS TO THIS FIREARM. EVEN, IF JAMES DID PURCHASE THE FIREARM YOU MAY FOCUS ON, MOM TOOK HIM TO THE SHOOTING RANGE. MOM WAS MORE INVOLVED AND I >> THAT WITH THE MOTHER'S TRIAL. I EXPECTED THEM TO POINT THEIR FINGERS AT EACH OTHER MORE. GIVEN THE FACT, THEY HAVE NOT SPOKEN TO EACH OTHER SINCE SHORTLY AFTER THE SHOOTING. I >> CRUMLEY TO TRY POINTING THE FINGER MORE AT THE MOTHER IN THIS CASE THEN THE MOTHER POINTING IT AT JAMES, THE FATHER IN HER CASE. YOU MIGHT SEE A TOTALLY DIFFERENT WITNESS- TESTIFYING. I DON'T THINK ETHAN'S MOTHER TESTIFIED ALL THAT WELL IN HER DEFENSE. IT IS UNDERSTANDABLE THAT TESTIFYING IS SCARY AND MOST FOLKS ARE NOT NATURAL AT. IF JAMES IS A BETTER SPEAKER, YOU MIGHT SEE HIM DO BETTER THAN HIS WIFE DID JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO. >>. DANNY CEBALLOS. THANK YOU SO MUCH. >>>. NOW TO IN NBC NEWS INVESTIGATION, THE FENTANYL FIGHT. AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN GIVEN NEW SCANNERS TO HELP DETECT THE DRUG INSIDE VEHICLES. BUT WE HAVE LEARNED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF THE SCANNERS ARE NOT BEING USED. HOMELAND SECURITY JULIE AVERY TAKES A LOOK. >>. Reporter. WE ARE ON THE FRONT LINES OF THE FENTANYL CRISIS. HALF OF ALL FENTANYL SEES COMING IN FROM MEXICO IS STOPPED HERE. CRITICS SAY THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION IS NOT DOING ENOUGH. WITH FENTANYL OVERDOSES, THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH FOR AMERICANS AGED 18 TO 45, TROY MILLER TELLS US IT IS DRIVEN IN BY VEHICLE. >>. DRIVEN IN BY MEN, WOMEN, YOUNG AND OLD MEXICAN CITIZENS >>. Reporter. BORDER AGENTS HAVE BEGUN USING A NEW TECHNOLOGY TO FIND FENTANYL HIDDEN IN VEHICLES. WE WATCHED AS OFFICERS TALK TO DRIVERS AND INSPECT CARS. THIS IS NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT HAS BEEN INSTALLED FOR CARS. OFFICER SUSPECT MIGHT BE CARRYING NARCOTICS. IT IS CONSIDERED GROUND ZERO FOR FENTANYL TRAFFICKING. >>. Reporter. LIST THAT -- LESS. >>. Reporter. LIST THAT -- LESS THAN 5% ARE ACTUALLY SCANNED WITH MORE NEW TECHNOLOGY. MILLER WANTS TO BRING THOSE NUMBERS UP TO 40% OF CARS AND 70% OF COMMERCIAL TRUCKS, BUT NOT FOR ANOTHER TWO YEARS. >>. Reporter. WHY NOT SCAN EVERY VEHICLE? >>. WE SEE 1 MILLION PEOPLE CROSSING THE BORDER EVERY SINGLE DAY. IF WE TRY TO SCAN EVERY SINGLE SHIPMENT, WE WOULD SHUT DOWN, TRADE AND TRAVEL. >>. Reporter. WE LEARNED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF TAXPAYER PURCHASED SCANNERS ARE SITTING IN WAREHOUSES UNUSED. >>. WE NEED APPROXIMATELY $300 MILLION TO PUT THE TECHNOLOGY ON THE GROUND. >>. Reporter. THE MONEY IS ALREADY SPENT AND IT IS SITTING THERE. IS THAT FRUSTRATING TO YOU? >> VERY FRUSTRATING. >>. Reporter. EVERY YEAR, ENOUGH FENTANYL IS TRAFFIC INTO THE UNITED STATES TO KILL EVERY AMERICAN >>. I THINK THE BORDER NEEDS TO BE CLOSED, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, BECAUSE IT IS A SUPERHIGHWAY AND THEY ARE JUST POURING IN. >>. Reporter. SHE LOST HER SON YEARS AGO WHEN HIS DRUGS WERE LACED WITH FENTANYL >>. YOU ALWAYS ASK THOSE QUESTIONS, BUT I DON'T WANT ANOTHER PARENT TO HAVE TO SAY: >>. THE COMMISSIONER IS ALSO CALLING ON CONGRESS FOR MORE MONEY TO START PUTTING SCANNERS TO USE. >>>. TIME FOR OUR MENTAL HEALTH CHECK AND WE WILL TAKE A LOOK AT THE MENTAL HEALTH IMPACT. >>>. A NEW STUDY SHOWS JUST HOW MUCH OUR PETS CAN BOOST OUR HEALTH >>>. JOINING US TO BREAK IT DOWN IS DOCTOR ROBBIE LUDWICK. WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THE BIG PROBLEMS OF BURNOUT CAUSED BY WORKING TOO MUCH. I UNDERSTAND. THERE IS A PSYCHOLOGIST OUT THERE WHO THINKS MANY OF US MAY BE EXPERIENCING MISALIGNMENT- EARNOUT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN AND HOW CAN WE WORK TO FIX IT? >>. Reporter. MISALIGNMENT BURNOUT IS EXACTLY HOW IT SOUNDS WHEN YOUR JOB IS NOT IN SYNC WITH WHO YOU ARE, WHAT YOUR VALUE SYSTEMS ARE, WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IN THE WORLD, AND IT CAN FEEL SOUL-CRUSHING WHEN THERE IS A MISMATCH, BECAUSE WORK IS WHERE WE SPEND A LOT OF OUR TIME. >>. HOW CAN WE FIX THAT? >>. THE WAY TO FIX IT IS TO ASK YOURSELF WHAT GIVES YOU JOY, WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO? GET SOME SUPPORT FOR YOURSELF. THERE ARE WAYS, BECAUSE WE PAY OUR BILLS. SO THERE ARE CERTAINLY WAYS TO INCORPORATE WHAT YOU LOVE, EITHER THROUGH VOLUNTEERING OR A HOBBY, JUST TO INCORPORATE FEELING PURPOSEFUL AND FEELING THAT YOU ARE IN SYNC WITH WHAT YOU ARE MEANT TO DO. >>. LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW MENTAL HEALTH IS PORTRAYED ON THE BIG SCREEN. TO GET SOME CLASSIC MOVIES LIKE FATAL ATTRACTION AND PSYCHO OFTEN CRITICIZED. BUT A NEW WAVE OF PSYCHOLOGISTS ARE ACTUALLY TRYING TO IMPROVE THE WAY MENTAL HEALTH IS PORTRAYED IN MOVIES. SO WHAT DO YOU THINK WE ARE GETTING WRONG ON THE SCREEN? WHAT SHOULD WE SEE? >>. Reporter. I ALWAYS LIKE TO SAY, WHEN THERAPISTS OR PSYCHIATRISTS ARE MISREPRESENTED SOME WRITER WHO IS VERY ANGRY WITH THEIR OWN THERAPIST BUT WE ARE SEEING A NEW TREND WHERE PSYCHOLOGIST ARE BEING HIRED TO REPRESENT THERAPY AND HEALTH IN A MORE ACCURATE WAY AND IT IS SHIFTING THE WAY CULTURE REALLY SEES THERAPY AND MENTAL HEALTH AND SEEKING TREATMENT. IT IS THE STIGMATIZING WHAT TREATMENT IS ALL ABOUT IN MANY WAYS. THIS IS VERY CONVINCING AND THE MOVIES REALLY ARE A MIRROR AND A WINDOW INTO THE POSSIBILITIES OF WHO WE ARE AND WHAT IS AVAILABLE TO US. >>. A NEW SURVEY SHOWS 84% OF AMERICANS WITH PETS SAY THE ANIMALS GIVE THEM AND MENTAL HEALTH BOOST. THIS IS ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO SHOW THE CLOSER. WE WILL SEE HER IN JUST A SECOND THERE SHE IS LOOK AT THAT. SHE IS ALSO A STRESS REDUCER. BUT HOW DO PETS MAKE SUCH A DIFFERENCE TO PEOPLE WHO? >>. Reporter. PETS OFFER UNCONDITIONAL LOVE, COMPANIONSHIP, AND THEY CAN REDUCE DEPRESSION AND ALSO REDUCE LONELINESS, WHICH IS A BIG EPIDEMIC IN THIS COUNTRY. THE STUDIES ARE TRUE THAT PETS ARE MAN'S BEST FRIEND AND THEY ARE ADORABLE TO HAVE AROUND AS WELL. IT IS A WIN-WIN SITUATION. >>. WHENEVER MY HUSBAND IS OUT OF TOWN, I FEEL LIKE I AM THE CRAZY PERSON TALKING TO THE DOG [ LAUGHTER ]. THANK YOU SO MUCH. >>>. COMING UP.

LET'S BRING IN THE TRAVEL EXPERT TO BREAK IT DOWN FOR US. I WAS READING ABOUT THIS YESTERDAY. ONE STUDY FOUND NEARLY 7% OF SALARIED WORKERS WERE ON SABBATICAL IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR. TWICE AS HIGH AS 2019.. HIGHER FOR GEN ZERS. WHAT IS BEHIND THIS TREND? >> SIX MONTHS OF PAID TIME OFF. I THINK WHAT IS DRIVING. THIS IS A SHIFT IN THE LANDSCAPE. IT WAS A RUN COMPANY OFFERING YOU A FOOSBALL TABLE FOOD, AND THEN WE HAD WORKING FROM HOME AND THE REAL SHIFT OF PUSHING BACK TO THE OFFICE. SO YOU SAY, LOOK, YOU CAN HAVE SIX MONTHS OFF, AND I THINK THAT IS WHAT IS DRIVING THAT. >>. THESE ARE ONE OF THE HYBRID ASPECTS OF FINDING WORK MODE- ASPECTS OF FINDING WORK MODE FOR A LONG TIME. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE CONCEPT OF DO-NOTHING VACATIONS. WHAT IS THAT? >> VACATION. IT IS INTERESTING BECAUSE IT TELLS US WHEN I WANT TIME OFF. I ACTUALLY WANT TIME OFF. I WAS IN A PRIVATE ISLAND LAST WEEK AND THESE PRIVATE ISLANDS, THE WHOLE POINT OF THEM, IS THAT YOU GO THERE AND YOU ARE NOT GOING SIGHTSEEING. YOU GO THERE TO HAVE SOMEONE BRING YOU A DRINK AND SAY, MAYBE I WILL PLAY A GAME OF TENNIS. IF I WILL PLAY A GAME OF TENNIS, IF I FEEL LIKE IT AND IT CAUSES US TO SAY I JUST WANT TIME OFF. >>. YOU ARE ON A PRIVATE ISLAND LAST WEEK, I WANT TO HANG OUT WITH YOU, EXCUSE ME. >>. I CALL THEM EXPLOSIVE, ALL INCLUSIVE, BRINGING IN A NEW KIND OF ALL- INCLUSIVE. WHICH ISN'T THAT WHERE YOU ARE BASICALLY, CAN I EAT MY BODY WEIGHT IN FRENCH FRIES IN THREE DAYS? IT IS ABOUT SAYING I WOULD DON'T WANT THE PAIN OF PAYING, I DON'T WANT THAT CHECK AT THE END.

BUT THE FOCUS S TONIGHT WILL B ON TRUMP, WHO IS THROWING A PARTY IN FLORIDA, AND ON NIKKI HALE, HEADED BACK TO SOUTH CAROLIN, WITH NO EVENTS SCHEDULED, ADDING TO THE SPECULATION OF THE END OF HER CAMPAIGN, COULD BE NEAR. >>. ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU. >>. FOR MORE ON SUPER TUESDAY, WE ARE JOINED BY OUR POLITICA CORRESPONDENT, STEVE KORNACKI, A THE BIG BOARD AND OUR POLITICS REPORTER, JONATHAN ALLEN. GOOD MORNING TO BOTH OF YOU. LET'S START WITH YOU, JOHN. WHAT ARE YOU WATCHING FOR AS THE RESULTS COME IN? ANY INDICATOR TO TELL HOW TH NIGHT MAY GO >>. I'M WATCHING TO SEE IF THER IS A MAJOR NATIONAL NATURA DISASTER. I DON'T KNOW IF IT WOULD BE A TUMBLE, WEED MAGEDDE OR THE SUN FALLING OUT OF TH SKY, BUT BASICALLY, TRUMP IS EXPECTED TO BARRING A MAJOR DISASTER. CLEAN UP TONIGHT. I THINK STEVE MAY TALK ABOUT THIS BUT IT IS UNLIKELY THAT I WILL CLINCH THE NOMINATION TONIGHT. BUT FROM A PRACTICAL MATTER, IT IS EXPECTED TO: >>. AND THE SUPREME COURT RULED THAT TRUMP IS ABLE TO BE ON TH PRIMARY BALLOT IN COLORADO AND OTHER STATES THAT WERE CHALLENGING HIS ELIGIBILIT, CITING THE 14th AMENDMEN, BECAUSE OF THE EVENTS LEADING TO THE JANUARY 6th ATTACK AT TH CAPITAL. TELL US THE TAKE AWAYS FROM TH DECISION >> NUMBER ONE. I THINK THE EFFORTS DEAD IN TERMS OF NOT JUST COLORADO BUT OTHER STATES THAT WANT TO DO SIMILAR THINGS, TO TRY TO TAKE TRUMP OFF THE BALLOT. IT WAS CLEAR ON THIS: 9-0.. YOU KNOW THE STATES CAN'T TAKE A FEDERAL CANDIDATE OFF TH BALLOT. I ALSO THINK THAT YOU ARE SEEING A NUMBER OF PATHWAYS THAT COUL HAVE PREVENTED DONALD TRUMP FROM THE LEGAL SYSTEM. OR MADE I HARDER FROM THE LEGAL SYSTEM T RUN FOR PRESIDENT OR WIN THE PRESIDENCY, THOSE ARE STARTING TO CLOSE OFF. THERE WAS ONE THING THAT WAS FASCINATING IN THE OPINION WRITTEN BY THE LIBERAL JUSTICE, WHO AGREED THAT COLORADO SHOUL NOT BE ABLE TO TAKE TRUMP OFF OF THE BALLOT, BUT THEY REPEATEDLY REFERRED TO OATH BREAKIN, INSURRECTIONIST, WHICH IS WHERE THEY ARE INCLINED TO GO IN TERMS OF CHALLENGES IN THE FUTUR BASED ON TRYING TO OVERTURN TH 2020 ELECTION. >> STEVE, LET'S BRING IN YOU HERE. I'M GUESSING TUMBLE WEEDS AR NOT ON THE BOARD, BUT GIVE US WHAT WE ARE EXPECTING TONIGHT. >> JOHN, GAVE US THE BOTTOM LIN FOR EXPECTATIONS. YOU SEE THE STATES IN YELLOW THAT WILL BE VOTING TODAY. THIS IS THE CURRENT DELEGATE COUNT, THE MAGIC NUMBER ON TH REPUBLICAN SIDE BEING 1215, AND I THINK A COUPLE OF THINGS TO HIGHLIGHT HERE. NUMBER ONE IS THE BIGGEST DELEGATE PRIZE O THE BOARD FOR REPUBLICANS IS CALIFORNIA: 169 DELEGATES. YOU SEE THE RULE IN CALIFORNIA, NO INDEPENDENTS, NO DEMOCRAT, CAN VOTE. IT IS A CLOSED REPUBLICA PRIMARY. WE HAVE SEEN THE STRENGTH, THE BACK BONE OF IT INDEPENDENT, AN DEMOCRATS, WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO VOTE. NONE OF THAT IN CALIFORNIA, AND CALIFORNIA A WINNER. TAKE ALL STATE. IF TRUMP CAN GET 50% PLUS ONE, HE GETS ALL 169. FOR TEXAS, NO QUITE AS CUT AND DRY A CALIFORNIA, BUT THEY ARE WINNER. TAKE ALL DELEGATES B CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT. EVERY REGION EXPECTS TRUMP WIL GET THE OVERWHELMING SHARE O THOSE BETWEEN THOSE TWO STATES. YO CAN SEE HOW QUICKLY THE NUMBER IS POISED TO RISE FOR TRUMP. OTHER STATES QUICKLY TO NOTE: ALABAMA, ARKANSAS, OKLAHOMA. IN PARTICULAR, THESE COULD BE STATES WHERE TRUMP ESSENTIALLY GETS ALL OF THE DELEGATES BASE ON THE STRENGTH HE HAS WITH TH TYPES OF VOTERS THAT DOMINATE IN THE STATES. EVEN IF HALEY IS GETTING 40%, 43% IN A LOT OF THE STATES- THAT'S HER BEST NUMBER SO FAR- EVEN IF SHE IS GETTING THAT IN A BUNCH OF STATES. THE WAY THE RULES ARE NOW ON THIS DAY FOR THE REPUBLICANS, THE RULES ARE DESIGNED TO GET A QUICK, AN DECISIVE OUTCOME. IT IS NOT GOING TO TRANSLATE T AS MANY DELEGATES >>. WALK US THROUGH. ANY PLACE AMONG THE 13 STATES THAT REPUBLICANS ARE VOTING TODAY WHERE NIKKI HALEY WOULD MAKE HEADWAY >>, THERE ARE A FEW. THE MOST OBVIOUS IS VERMONT. VERMONT IS AN OPEN PRIMARY, NO PARTY REGISTRATION, VERY SMALL STATE. HALEY DID GET 43% IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. VERMONT WAS ONE OF TRUMP'S WORST STATES. THE FIRST TIME HE RAN ONLY 32% OF THE VOTE BACK. THEN JOHN KASICH AND MARCO RUBIO HA A COMBINED MAJORITY FOR THAT I 2016. SHE COULD TAKE A RUN AT TRUMP IN VERMONT, VIRGINIA, IS INTERESTING ESPECIALLY. IN THE NORTHERN PAR OF VIRGINIA, THE KEY TO VIRGINIA, THEY GIVE OUT DELEGATES BASED ON CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS. YOU MENTIONED THE WASHINGTON DC PRIMARY LOW TURNOUT BU. THE WASHINGTON DCELECTORAT HAS A LOT OF OVER LAP WITH THE NORTHERN VIRGINIA DC SUBURBS. HALEY COULD MAKE SOME NOIS AROUND THERE AND PICK UP A FEW DELEGATES. MINNESOTA, COLORADO, COULD D. REASONABLY WELL IN THOSE STATES. AGAIN, VERMONT ONLY HAS 17 DELEGATES. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A SHARE I COLORADO, MINNESOTA EVEN.

WE BEGIN WITH A BIG SHAPE UP IN THE RACE FOR THE WHITE HOUSE. RHONDA McDANIEL WILL STEP DOWN AS THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE. THE FORMER PRESIDENT CONTINUES TO DOMINATE. IT IS PRIMARY BATTLE AGAINST NIKKI HALEY. TRUMP WON THE PRIMARY SATURDAY NIGHT >>>. THIS WIDENS TRUMP'S LEADS WHEN HE COMES TO DELEGATES. HALEY SAYS SHE IS LOOKING FORWARD TO NEXT WEEK, WHEN SEVERAL STATES WILL TAKE PART IN SUPER TUESDAY >>. I SAID EARLIER THAT NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS IN SOUTH CAROLINA, I WOULD CONTINUE TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT IN THE NEXT 10 DAYS, ANOTHER 21 DATES AND TERRITORIES WILL VOTE. THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO A REAL CHOICE. >>. WE ARE JOINED BY MARK MURRAY AND JONATHAN ALLEN. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE, MARK. LET'S START WITH YOU, RON McDANIEL, STEPPING DOWN. WHAT YOU THINK OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT? >>. IT'S A SIGN OF HOW FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP REIGNS OVER THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND ITS ORGANIZATION AS HE MARCHES TO BECOME THE LIKELY PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE. DONALD TRUMP HAS ALREADY ENDORSED THE CHAIR OF THE NORTH CAROLINA REPUBLICAN PARTY TO BE THE NEXT CHAIR. THE RNC HAS STRUGGLED TO RAISE MONEY AND AFTER THE REPUBLICANS LOST IN 2018 MIDTERMS, THE 2022 ELECTIONS. AS WELL, MANY PEOPLE HAVE POINTED THE FINGER AT ROBIN McDANIELS AND OTHER BLAMED FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP >>. LET'S BRING YOU IN HERE AND TALK ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING. TALK ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING. YOU MENTIONED HOW NIKKI HALEY DID NOT DO WELL IN SOUTH CAROLINA. SHE IS ALSO LOSING SOME NOTABLE SUPPORT, INCLUDING FINANCIALS OF WORK. WALK US THROUGH WHAT IS HAPPENING TO HER AND HOW SIGNIFICANT THIS IS AS SHE TRIES TO HANG ON. >>. WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN IS SOME BIG DONORS- AMERICA'S FOR PROSPERITY AND OTHERS- HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THERE IS NO MARGINAL RETURN ON INVESTMENT FOR EACH DOLLAR THEY PUT INTO NIKKI HALEY. WHEN SHE WORKS AND LOOKS AT THE OUTLOOK, SHE WILL HAVE SOME MONEY TO COMPETE, BUT THE TRUTH IS THERE IS NOT A SINGLES DATE THAT SHE CAN IDENTIFY, THAT SHE IS GOING TO WIN, AND SHE CANNOT COME IN FIRST IN ANY STATE SO SHE CANNOT WIN THE NOMINATION. >>. LET'S TALK ABOUT MICHIGAN THAT TAKES PLACE TOMORROW MICHIGAN CONGRESSWOMAN. ONCE PEOPLE TO VOTE UNCOMMITTED IN THE PRIMARY. THIS WAS IN RESPONSE TO WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE HAD TO SAY ABOUT ISRAEL AND HUMAS. WHAT KIND OF IMPACT DOES THIS HAVE? >> YES, IT'S A PROTEST AGAINST PRESIDENT BIDEN. WE HAVE SEEN THIS IN NATIONAL SURVEYS AND SOME POLLING IN MICHIGAN, WHERE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN TRAILS FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. THE MARGIN IS WITHIN THE MARGIN OF ERROR AND MICHIGAN IS AN OPEN PRIMARY. SEE, YOU'RE GOING TO SEE YOUNG PEOPLE PARTICIPATING IN THIS DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY AND THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY, AND THAT IS -- THAT BEING AN OPEN PRIMARY. NIKKI HALEY SEES AS A BENEFIT DESPITE TRAILING FOR SOME OF THE UPCOMING CONTEST. SOME OF THE INDEPENDENTS AND CROSSOVER DEMOCRATS MIGHT END UP VOTING FOR HER. >>. BEFORE I LET YOU GO, THIS IS LOOKING MORE AND MORE LIKE WE WILL HAVE A REMATCH BETWEEN PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN AND FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. THERE IS SOMETHING INTERESTING FROM MEET, THE PRESS WERE GAVIN NEWSOM BIDEN TO DEBATE TRUMP- WE KNOW IS CAMPAIGN- HAS BEEN NONCOMMITTAL TO THIS. WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THOSE COMMENTS? >>. I WANT TO KNOW WHAT WAS BEHIND THOSE COMMENTS. WHETHER THAT WAS IT SOMETHING THAT GOT THAT WAS IT SOMETHING THAT GOT A GREEN LIGHT? FOR THAT, I THINK THE BOTTOM LINE IS COMPLETELY UNCLEAR. OBVIOUSLY, WE HAVE SEEN FRUSTRATION FROM THE TRUMP SIDE ABOUT THE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE COMMISSION BUT THERE'S ALSO THE BIDEN SIDE. THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THIS. IT WOULD BE FASCINATING AND I THINK THE PUBLIC DESERVES TO SEE THIS DEBATE BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR. THAT WILL ACTUALLY HAPPEN. >>. OKAY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TAKING YOUR TIME OUT ON A MONDAY >>>. A DOZEN AIRSTRIKES HAVE BEEN LAUNCHED AGAINST LEBANON OVER THE WEEKEND. WE ARE JOINED BY A FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT IN LONDON. GOOD MORNING, SO TALK TO US ABOUT THESE WEEKEND STRIKES. >>. Reporter. THE US NEEDS THESE FIGHTER JETS BUT THEY HAVE BECOME TARGETS. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DRONES, AIR DEFENSE SYSTEM AND RADAR. WE ARE SEEING THESE ATTACKS BECAUSE THE FIGHTING IS NOT LETTING UP. THEY CONTINUE THEIR TAX YOU PAY TRIES TO STOP THEM TAKE. LAST WEEK THE MILITIA FIRED A MISSILE THAT SET A CARGO VESSEL ON FIRE. THESE ATTACKS ARE HAVING AN IMPACT. NINE% OF VESSELS HAVE DIVERTED AROUND AFRICA. THE COST WILL BE PASSED ON TO CONSUMERS. >>. AS YOU MENTIONED, THERE IS A CRISIS ONGOING. IT'S A JOINT MISSION TO HIS TOP ATTACKS. IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE. THAT IS DONE MUCH. WHAT ARE WE HEARING FROM US OFFICIALS AND IS THERE THAT THIS TIME MAKES A DIFFERENCE? >>. YOU ARE RIGHT, IT'S A FOURTH JOINT OPERATION WE HAVE SEEN SINCE JANUARY 12.. KEEP IN MIND: THE US HAS ALSO BEEN CARRYING OUT ALMOST DAILY STRIKES TO TAKE OUT TARGETS. THE US DEFENSE SECRETARY SAID: THE UNITED DAYS WILL NOT HESITATE TO TAKE BACK AND DEFEND LIVES IN THE FREE FLOW OF COMMERCE IN IT CRITICAL WATERWAY. WE WILL MAKE CLEAR THAT THEY WILL BEAR THE CONSEQUENCES IF THEY DO NOT STOP ILLEGAL ATTACKS, THEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT FOR JOINT ATTACKS WITH THE UNITED STATES AND UK SINCE JANUARY AND SO FAR THAT IS NOT SEEM TO STOP THEM FROM LAUNCHING COUNTERATTACKS. COUNTERATTACKS >>>. GIBSON GUITAR WILL HOST >>> GIBSON GUITAR WILL HOST TALKS. HUMAS SAYS ATTEMPTS, STRIKES ARE DETERRING THEM FROM CONTINUING ATTACKS AGAINST COMMERCIAL SHIPS IN THE RED SEA >>>. TWO YEARS SINCE THE WAR IN UKRAINE BEGAN, WORK THE PRESIDENT THERE SAID 31,000 SOLDIERS TO BE KILLED. THEY ARE RUNNING OUT OF SUPPLIES AND URGE CONGRESS TO APPROVE MORE MILITARY AID. HERE'S THE INTERVIEW >>. Reporter. AS UKRAINE COMMEMORATES TWO YEARS SINCE THE INVASION. THE PRESIDENT THE INVASION. THE PRESIDENT THERE SAID THEY SHOULD RAID SUPPLIES OF AMMUNITION. 21,000 TROOPS HAVE BEEN KILLED SO FAR. THE PRESIDENT SAID RUSSIAN TROOPS ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE LACK OF SUPPLIES WITH A NEW OFFENSIVE WHICH YOU WILL INTENSIFY OVER THE NEXT TWO MONTHS. I MET UP WITH THE PRESIDENT. THE PRESIDENT BEGAN BY SAYING: UKRAINE HAS NO CHOICE BUT TO KEEP FIGHTING, BECAUSE THE COST OF LOSING IS EVERYTHING, OF LOSING IS EVERYTHING >>. [ INAUDIBLE ]. I JUST RETURNED FROM SEVERAL AREAS ALONG THE FRONT LINE. SOLDIERS THERE TOLD ME THAT AFTER RATION AMMUNITION, WHAT HAPPENS YOUR COUNTRY IF AMERICAN AID DOES NOT ARRIVE? >> WE WILL LOSE A LOT OF PEOPLE AND TERRITORY. WE NEED A STRONG PACKAGE >>. DOES THE UNITED STATES WANT? >> DOES THE UNITED STATES WANT UKRAINE TO WIN THE WAR? JUST CONTAIN AND WE CAN RUSSIA >>. I HOPE SO. OTHERWISE, HOW DO WE STOP? IT'S TOO DIFFICULT TO LIVE WITHOUT INFRASTRUCTURE >>. YOU SAID YOU BELIEVE THIS YEAR IS A TURNING POINT FOR UKRAINE BECAUSE OF US ELECTIONS PARTLY. ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP? ARE YOU WORRIED THAT HE COULD PULL THE PLUG? >> I HOPE HE WILL NOT STOP IF HE WILL BE THE PRESIDENT. THAT IS THE DECISION OF YOUR PEOPLE. I COUNT ON REPRESENTATION. >>. UKRAINE COULD PRESENT ITS TERMS TO RUSSIA, FOLLOWED BY DIRECT THOUGHTS. THE KREMLIN HAS ALREADY REJECTED THE PROPOSAL. >> OKAY, THE EAST COAST AND SEVEN PLANES EXPECT ABOVE AVERAGE TEMPERATURES. THE WEST IS NOT SO LUCKY. THERE WAS SOME PROGRESS MADE. >> HELLO, IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU >>>. WE WILL SEE TEMPERATURES 30 TO 35 DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL PORTIONS OF THE EAST AND THE SOUTHERN PLAINS IN THE 90s. IT WILL FEEL LIKE SUMMER IN FEBRUARY SNOW IN THE WEST. WE HAD SNOW OVER THE WEEKEND AND WE WILL SEE THAT ONCE AGAIN TODAY. IT WILL BE VERY WINDY AS WELL: 60 TO 70 MILES PER HOUR WINDS. SO OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS WE HAVE FEBRUARY RECORD BEING BROKEN IN MANY AREAS. IT'S POSSIBLE IN 25 STATES. LOOK AT THE RED DOTS. THOSE ARE RECORD-BREAKING TEMPERATURES. OVER 100 RECORDS PER TOMORROW AND WEDNESDAY. THIS WILL ALSO BE POSSIBLE. THEN WELL, ABOVE AVERAGE TEMPERATURES. LOOK AT THESE NUMBERS: DALLAS: 93 DEGREES IS THE ACTIVE HIGH IN FEBRUARY. THAT WOULD BE A RECORD IN THE 80s IN EL PASO, CLOSED. 80 DEGREES IN KANSAS CITY AND 70 DEGREES IN CHICAGO. THE RECORD THERE IS 64 DEGREES. WE HAVE A CHANCE OF GETTING INTO THE LOW 60s >>. THEN A HUGE DIP FOR WEDNESDAY: A 40 DEGREES TUMBLE INTO WEDNESDAY FIRST TEMPERATURES INTO THE 90s IN SAN ANTONIO AND 80s IN OKLAHOMA CITY, 60s IN DETROIT- LOOK AT THIS TUMBLE THOUGH. FOR WEDNESDAY, THIS COLD FRONT BRINGS THE THREAT OF SEVERE STORMS AND IT CLEARS OUT THE WARM AIR. BIG DIFFERENCE FOR THURSDAY UNTIL WEDNESDAY: WARM IN DC, A 20 DEGREE DIFFERENCE ON FRIDAY. THESE GO UP AND THEN TUMBLE OUT. WEST: HEAVY SNOW FROM THE CASCADES TO THE ROCKIES. FEET OF SNOW, DAMAGING WINDS FROM MONTANA TO NEW MEXICO. THE WIND WILL GUST UP TO 70 MILES PER HOUR IN SOME SPOTS. BLIZZARD LIKE CONDITIONS, WITH SNOW FALLING ONE TO TWO INCHES PER HOUR. THE NORTHERN ROCKIES WILL HAVE HECTIC TRAVEL WHERE YOU SEE THE BLUE, THAT SNOW. THIS GOES ACROSS TO THE EAST AND CLEARS OUT WARMER TEMPERATURES BEFORE THAT, REALLY WARM AIR. AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT, SEVERE STORMS WILL COME THROUGH PORTIONS OF THE OHIO VALLEY AND TORNADOES LARGE HAIL, GUSTY WINDS AND HEAVY DOWNPOURS BEHIND THAT SNOW. FOR THE MIDWEST: COLD AIR BEHIND THE COLD FRONT COMING THROUGH WEDNESDAY. FOR MUCH OF THE EAST COAST: HEAVY RAIN FALLING ON WEDNESDAY, BUT THE TEMPERATURES WILL REALLY TUMBLE. 5 MILLION PEOPLE WILL BE IMPACTED BY WINTER. WEATHER ADVISORIES ARE COMING OUT FEET OF SNOW IN MANY SPOTS. THE WIND WILL BE GUSTY AND IT COULD BE TRICKY TRAVEL THROUGH THE INTERMOUNTAIN WET. THERE IS A SEVERE THREAT. A HEADS UP. THIS GOES INTO A HEADS UP. THIS GOES INTO WEDNESDAY AND 25 MILLION ARE AT RISK OF SEVERE WEATHER. TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY >>>. MUCH MORE TO COME. CONCERNS ABOUT THE FUTURE OF IBF TREATMENTS FOLLOWING A CONTROVERSIAL COURT RULING IN ALABAMA. ALABAMA FIRST A MURDER INVESTIGATION, COLLEGE CAMPUS INTENSIFYING THE >>>. WE ARE BACK ROMANCES ACTED >>>. WE ARE BACK ROMANCES ACTED OF KILLING. EIGHT UNIVERSITY OF OREGON STUDENT HAD A CRIMINAL RECORD IN THE US. HE WAS IN THE COUNTRY ILLEGALL. THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION IS PARTIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS ATTACK. THIS COMES AS STUDENTS CONTINUE TO MOURN THE LOSS OF THE STUDENT. THE FAMILY IS PREPARING FOR FUNERAL HOMELAND SECURITY. CORRESPONDENT JOINS US WITH THE LATEST. SO WHAT NEW DETAILS ARE WE LEARNING ABOUT THE SUSPECT? >>. OVER THE WEEKEND WE LEARNED HE HAD BEEN ARRESTED BY THE NYPD IN NEW YORK IN SEPTEMBER OF LAST YEAR FOR ACTING IN A MANNER THAT WOULD INJURE A CHILD UNDER 17.. IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT THAT DETAILS OF THAT WAS. HE WAS ARRESTED. THEY WERE IN A SANCTUARY CITY THAT DOES NOT TELL ICE WHEN THEY WERE GOING TO RELEASE, SO THEY COULD NOT HAVE HIM REMOVED. THIS IS A CONTROVERSY THAT IS PLAYED OUT TIME AND TIME AGAIN. ICE WANTS TO REMOVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN CHARGED WITH CRIMES SO THEY CAN GO FOR DEPORTATION. HE WAS RELEASED WITHOUT OFFICIALS BEING NOTIFIED. SO TELL US MORE ABOUT THE BORDER POLICIES AND WHAT OTHER LAWMAKERS ARE SAYING ABOUT THE CRITICISM >>. IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT WE WOULD SEE A LOT OF DISAPPOINTMENT PLAYED OUT IN POLITICS, ESPECIALLY WITH IMMIGRATION BEING SUCH A HOT ISSUE GOING INTO THIS CAMPAIGN. THIS MAN SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN IN THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE OF THE BORDER POLICIES, OF RELEASING SOMEONE IN CITIES NOT COOPERATING. GO BACK AT LEAST THROUGH THE LAST THREE ADMINISTRATIONS. THEY ARE NOW USUALLY CROSSING THE BORDER ILLEGALLY. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE FLEEING OF VENEZUELA AND RECENTLY THEY STOPPED ALLOWING THE US AND MAX ARE GO TO SOUP PORT NATIONALS. BACK THAT WAS AGREED TO LAST FALL. THEY CLOSED THE DOOR AGAIN, INTENSIFYING THIS WHOLE CONVERSATION >>. WHAT DOES THAT? TELL US ABOUT LARGER FRUSTRATIONS ABOUT IMMIGRATION POLICIES >>. IT COMES DOWN TO NUMBERS. WE KNOW STUDIES SHOW THAT UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS PER PERSON COMMIT FEWER CRIMES. THERE ARE SO MANY UNDOCUMENTED THAT THERE ARE RECORD SETTERS. IN LAST TWO YEARS, THE NUMBER OF COUNTRIES OF PEOPLE COMING HERE AS IN ADDED. THERE ARE PEOPLE FROM CHINA AND AFRICA. THEIR MOBILE MIGRATION PATTERNS, PATTERNS- WE MARCHED ON THIS BEFORE POLICE- HAVE BEEN ATTACKED. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS TRYING TO GET A LOT MORE ATTENTION AS IMMIGRATION POLICIES BECOME MORE AND MORE SCRUTINIZED. >>. THANK YOU SO MUCH. >>>. INTERNATIONAL NEWS OR BRAZILIAN LEADER FACES Q ALLEGATIONS. WE HAVE THAT GOOD MORNING >>. Reporter- GOOD MORNING. [ INAUDIBLE ]. THE FORMER PRESIDENT OF BRAZIL CALLED FOR A RALLY FROM SOCIAL MEDIA. A RALLY FROM SOCIAL MEDIA. [ INAUDIBLE ]. THERE COULD BE A COUP PLOT TO. THERE COULD BE A COUP PLOT TO STAY IN POWER AFTER LOSING THE 2024 ELECTION. THE CLAIM IS BEEN DENIED. >>>.

I KNOW YOU LOVE CHRISTMAS, SO I'M SURE YOU DECORATE THE TREE, BUT HAVE YOU TRIED TO GROW ONE? BUT HAVE YOU TRIED TO GROW ONE? >>. ALL WOMAN DID. SHE WAS SUING AN INSURANCE COMPANY CALLING HER CAR ACCIDENT PUT HER IN A BAD CONDITION. SHE WAS SAID. SHE WAS UNABLE TO WORK OR PLAY WITH HER CHILDREN. THIS IS A PICTURE. THAT IS NOT HER. IT'S JUST AN IDEA OF WHAT A COMPETITION LOOKS LIKE. SHE WON THE COMPETITION BUT THEN THE JUDGE SAW HER PICTURE IN THE NATIONAL NEWSPAPER. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH. >>>. 10 YEARS SINCE OBAMA LAUNCHED MY BROTHER'S KEEPER.

ANNIVERSARY OF OBAMA'S SIGNATURE. EFFORT- MY BROTHERS KEEPER. THIS ANNIVERSARY COMES ON THE HEELS OF ANOTHER IMPORTANT DATE IN AMERICAN HISTORY: THE KILLING OF TREY VON MARTIN. WE DECIDED TO GO TO ONE OF THE MODEL COMMUNITIES FOR MY BROTHERS COMMUNITY TO SEE OUT 10 YEARS LATER. THIS SHAPES THE LIVES OF YOUNG MEN. >>.

THESE KIDS STRUGGLED IN REGULAR PUBLIC SCHOOLS. ADMINISTRATOR. SAY STUDENTS WHAT ROLE MODELS WHO LOOK LIKE THEM >>. THESE STUDENTS ARE IN A PROGRAM CALLED MEN OF EXCELLENCE, AS PART OF A COMMUNITY NETWORK TO EMPOWER YOUNG MAN, TO SEE IN THEMSELVES WHAT SOCIETY MAY NOT. THAT IS THE MY BROTHERS KEEPER ALLIANCE. THIS WAS STARTED BY BARACK OBAMA IN 2014.. IT WAS HIS RESPONSE TO TREY VON MARTINS DEATH. >>. Reporter. THIS PROVIDES MENTORSHIP, EDUCATION AND JOB TRAINING. >>. WE ARE FACILITATORS OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN THEIR JOURNEY. >>. WE ARE SEEING CONCRETE REDUCTIONS IN THE HOMICIDE. OBAMA SAYS THERE IS A STORK DROP IN HOMICIDES TO A 60 YEAR LOW IN JUST OVER A DECADE. THEN YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH EVERY DAY REDUCTION IN HOMICIDES. IT'S YOUNG MEN THAT ARE LIVING BETTER. THEY WILL BE FULLY PRESENT IN THEIR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES, EVEN IN OUR DEMOCRACY. >>. Reporter. THEY HAVE REACHED THOUSANDS OF YOUNG MEN WITH POSITIVE RESULTS. IT'S CALLED MODEL COMMUNITIES. THEY ARE CREDITED, WITH HELPING TO ELEVATE THE HIGHEST GRADUATION RATE FOR YOUNG MEN OF COLOR IN THE STATE. >>. THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE YOUNG MEN IN OUR CITY.

THIS IS NOTHING NEW: COURT STORMING, WHAT IS HAPPENING LATELY AND WHY IS HE GETTING SO MUCH ATTENTION? >>. GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME- IS GAINING POPULARITY BECAUSE WE ARE NOW IN THE ENVIRONMENT WHERE A PERSON WAS TAKING A PICTURE OF THEMSELVES AND STREAMING THEMSELVES IN TRYING TO MAKE SURE THEY HAD A VIRAL MOMENT AND THEY WERE NOT LOOKING AT WHAT THEY ERE DOING. SO THAT IS ONE EFFORT THAT PEOPLE WANT TO BE PART OF THE NEWS AND PART OF THE CELEBRATION, AND THAT IS LEADING TO ISSUES LIKE THIS, WHERE THEY ARE NOT LOOKING AT, WHERE THEY ARE GOING AND NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO PROTECT OTHER PEOPLE >>. WHAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT THIS IS THERE SOMETHING PHYSICAL, LIKE A BARRICADE OR SECURITY. RECENTLY YOU SAID THAT MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST IDEA. WHY IS THAT? >> PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO STORM A SPORT OR A FIELD AND YOU HAVE BARRIERS. THAT COULD CAUSE ISSUES. WHERE YOU COULD HAVE SUFFOCATION, SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU SEE AT ROCK CONCERTS OR OTHER AREAS. WHERE YOU HAVE A BARRIER IN AND INAPPROPRIATE LOCATION. THERE MUCH BETTER STRATEGIES, INCLUDING PROCEDURES FOR STUDENTS INDICATING THAT IF A STORM THE FIELD THEY COULD FACE CONSEQUENCES LIKE FINES, EXPULSION, WHATEVER MIGHT BE. THAT IS WHAT THEY NEED TO TRY TO IMPLEMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT FANS DON'T GET INTO HARMS WAY OR CAUSE TROUBLE FOR THE PLAYERS. >>. WHEN IT COMES TO FINDS. THERE WAS AN EXAMPLE. THEY HAD A $100,000 FINE. DO YOU THINK SCHOOLS ARE RESPONSIBLE? SHOULD IT BE UP TO THE INSTITUTIONS TO HAVE THEM FIND IN THAT WAY? OR DO YOU THINK INDIVIDUALS SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND IF SO, HOW? >> I DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE THE INSTITUTIONS. THE SEC HAD A FINE STRUCTURE IN PLACE FOR YEARS AND IT IS NOT STOPPED ANY INCIDENTS OF FINE. THEY GET FUNDRAISERS TO HELP PAY FOR IT, SO IT DOES NOT STOP THEIR BEHAVIOR. YOU NEED TO HAVE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. IN THE STUDENT CODE OF CONDUCT THAT SAYS LOOK. THIS IS NOT WHAT WE DO AT OUR INSTITUTION. IF YOU ENGAGE IN THIS, WE WILL PUNISH YOU. IT HAS TO BE FOLLOWED UP WITH ACTUAL PUNISHMENT AND THEN FANS WILL GET THE GIST OF IT. WE DON'T SEE IT AT THE PROFESSIONAL LEVEL BECAUSE IT'S A DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT AT THE COLLEGE LEVEL. THEY COULD PREVENT THESE FROM HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE. >>. THAT WILL BE A INTERESTING CONVERSATION. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. >>. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME >>. >>>. IBF TREATMENTS AT CLINICS IN ALABAMA ARE SUSPENDED AFTER A EMBRYO RULING. LAST WEEK, THIS BREAKTHROUGH HAS BROUGHT THE GIFT OF CHILDREN TO MILLIONS OF PARENTS WHO OTHERWISE COULD NOT HAVE THEM, OTHERWISE COULD NOT HAVE THEM. NOW THEY ARE CONCERNED AFTER ROLLING.

ALL IBF SERVICES HAVE BEEN SAYS AND IT YOU HAVE YOUR ENTIRE -- NOT PLAN A OR PLAN B. IT'S PROBABLY EVERYONE'S LAST RESORT. THEN YOU HAVE THAT TAKEN AWAY FROM YOU.

THIS INFLUENCE IS BEING HOTLY DEBATED AND COULD HAVE MAJOR IMPLICATIONS FOR CONTENT. YOU SEE, ON SOCIAL MEDIA IN THE FUTURE. OUR CORRESPONDENT IS WITH US, RIGHT NOW THESE CASES GOT ALL THE WAY TO THE SUPREME COURT. AND WHAT IS BEING ARGUED THERE >>. Reporter EXPERTS ARE SAYING THIS IS A CASE THAT COULD RESHAPE THE ENTER DATE. AS WE KNOW IT, IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT CASE AGAINST SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES EVER. THE COURTS HAVE DISAGREED THE FACT. THEY UPHELD THE LAW OR NOT IT OUT. DOES THE FIRST AMENDMENT PROTECT THE COMPANIE? AMENDMENT PROTECT THE COMPANIE FACEBOOK AND YOUTUBE, ETC. FROM CURATING CONTENT? THEY LIKE NEWSPAPERS AND CAN PUBLISH ANYTHING THEY WANT. ARE THEY LIKE THE OLD PHONE COMPANY REQUIRED BY LAW TO CARRY EVERYBODY'S MESSAGE, WHETHER THEY LIKE IT OR NOT? THE IMPLICATION IS: DOES FACEBOOK HAVE THE RIGHT TO NOT HAVE PROPAGANDA, WHICH IT DOES RIGHT? NOW, THIS COULD BE DARK AND DISTURBING >> ACCORDING TO THE ATTORNEY. >>. ACCORDING TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, THAT IS NOT ALLOWING SOCIAL MEDIA TO ABUSE THEIR POWER. WHAT HAS TO BE WEIGHED BEFORE THERE COULD BE A RULING >>LAW STEMS FROM BANNING DONALD TRUMP FROM THE PLATFORM OVER EXTREMIST CONTENT HE WAS PUTTING OUT. THE JUSTICES WILL HAVE TO CALL ON THEIR PRESIDENTS BUT THEY HAVE MADE CLEAR THAT THERE IS NO PRECEDENT FOR THIS, BECAUSE WE ARE IN A NEW WORLD AND WE HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS PLATFORM BEFORE IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE NEWSPAPERS ARE SUBJECT TO LIABLE FOR CONTENT THEY PUBLISH. SO SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES ARE SO. SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES ARE NOT. IT IS SECTION 130.. THEY HAVE A GET OUT OF JAIL FREE CARD, AND CONSERVATIVES ARGUE THAT IF YOU HAVE THAT, YOU HAVE TO PUBLISH EVERYTHING >>. IS NO SURPRISE THAT THIS BREAKS DOWN ALONG POLITICAL LINES AS MANY DO. IS IT TOO MUCH OR NOT ENOUGH? TOO MUCH CONTENT? MODERATION AND DEMOCRATS SAY THERE IS NOT ENOUGH. HOW COULD THIS IMPACT SOCIAL MEDIA REGULATION AND THE CONTENTS YOU WILL SEE ON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS IN THE FUTURE? AND THIS IS ALL ON THE BACKDROP OF AN ELECTION YEAR >>. ABSOLUTELY FOR EXAMPLE, IS SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES CANNOT REGULATE AND CURATE THINGS COULD GO ONE UNABATED RIGHT. NOW THEY LOOK FOR AUTHENTIC ACCOUNTS. OTHERS ARE TAKEN DOWN FOR CONSERVATIVES TO TAKEN DOWN FOR CONSERVATIVES TO WORRY. THIS IS A BIG WORD, NELLIS. GO- THIS IS A BIG WORD, NELLIS. GO TO MONEY NEWS. ECONOMIC DATA COMES OUT.

YOU SAID YOU AGRE WITH THE STATE SUPREME COURT DECISION THAT EMBRYOS AR CHILDREN. I WANT TO PUT A FINE POINT O THIS: YOU SUPPORT IVF AS IT IS PRACTICED IN THE UNITED STATES, WHICH INVOLVES THE PRODUCTION OF EMBRYOS THAT ARE SOMETIMES DETROIT, STROYED OR DONATED I THEY ARE UNUSED >>. FIRST, I DO SUPPORT IVF BECAUSE I HAVE SEVERAL FRIENDS THAT HAVE GONE THROUGH THE PROCEDURE. IT HAS MADE THEIR FAMILIES WHOLE. IT HAS ALLOWED THEM TO HAV CHILDREN. THEIR CHILDREN ARE WONDERFUL. I TOTALLY SUPPORT THE PROCEDURE NUMBER TWO. WHEN THE REPORTE ASKED ME THAT QUESTION, I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HALLWAY AND HEARD THE TAIL END OF IT. I DIDN'T HEAR ABOUT THE ALABAM RULING. IT WAS ABOUT. DO I BELIEVE THAT EMBRYOS SHOULD BE PROTECTED? THAT'S WHAT I SAID, BECAUSE I HEARD HALF A QUESTION: DO I SUPPORT THE IVF PROCEDURE 100%? I DO. IT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE AND, AS PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID, WE REALLY WANT THE ALABAM LEGISLATURE. TOSURE THE PROCEDURE IS PROTECTED FROM FAMILIES WHO DO STRUGGLE WITH HAVING CHILDREN. THAT HELPS THEM CREATE GREAT FAMILIES, WHICH IS WHAT OUR COUNTRY DESPERATELY NEEDS. >>. SO JUST TO BE VERY CLEAR, D YOU BELIEVE THAT EMBRYOS ARE PEOPLE? SHOULD THEY BE TREATED AS PEOPLE, WITH ALL OF THE SAME LEGAL RIGHTS? >>. WELL, NOW YOU ARE GETTING INTO A PERSON HOOD ARGUMENT. THIS IS WHERE A LOT OF DETAILS IN LEGISLATION AND COURT RULINGS ARE IMPORTANT. I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT LEGISLATORS HAVE TO MAKE SUR THEY WALK THEMSELVES THROUGH. THE IVF PROCEDURE IS VER IMPORTANT TO A LOT OF COUPLES IN OUR COUNTRY. IT SHOULD BE PROTECTED. I AGREE WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP O THAT. BUT WHEN WE GET INTO THE CONVERSATIONS, IT IS IMPORTANT TO DELINEATE FROM WHAT ONE JUDGE MIGHT SAY VERSUS WHAT LEGISLATURE AND A GOVERNOR WIL DECIDE WHEN THEY GO THROUGH TH LEGISLATIVE PROCESS >>.

YOU NEED CASH AND REAL ESTAT FOR YOUR PORTFOLIO. YOU CAN SEE THAT YOU HAVE TOOL AND CALCULATORS. IT IS IMPORTANT NOT TO SET I AND FORGET IT OVER TIME. REEVALUATE YOUR GOALS AND IT USED TO BE THAT. YOU HAD A PENSION, SO YOU RETIRE AT 65. AND THEN YOU GOT 60% OF TH SALARY. THAT IS NOT THE WORLD WE ARE LIVING IN NOW. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE HEALTHIE AND THEY WANT TO KEEP WORKING.

STATE OF THE UNION 2024: PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION: ALL BUT SET. PRESIDENT BIDEN APPEARS TO FACE THE NATION. WHAT HE PLANS WHILE HE TRIES TO REASSURE THE COUNTRY. >>> FIRE UP THE POWER OF LOVE TO THE DELORIAN BEHIND THE SCENES OF THE HIT BROADWAY MUSICAL BACK TO THE FUTURE AND THE DEBUT OF OUR NEW SERIES: CURTAIN CALL >>> CURTAIN CALL >>. GOOD QUESTION. CAN I FIT NO A DELORIAN? WE HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE THE ANSWER. >>. WE ARE EXCITED TO BRING THAT COULD YOU. GOOD TO HAVE YOU. I AM JOE FRYER >>. I M SAVANNAH SELLERS. WE WILL GET START WITH A VERDICT OVER THE SHOOTING OF THE RUST MOVIE SEAT. NEW MEXICO, JURY FOUND HANNAH GUTIERREZ-REID, GUILTY FOR THE FATAL SHOOTING OF HALYNA HUTCHENTS >>. THIS IS THE MOMENT THEY READ INTO THE VERDICT, AFTER DELIBERATING. UNDER THREE HOURS TRIAL, WHICH CENTERED ON THE 21 SHOOTING, LASTED TWO WEEKS. SHE WAS FOUND GUILTY OF TWO COUNTS OF INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER AND THE JURY HAD A NOT GUILTY VERDICT ON EVIDENCE TAMPERING AND SHE FACE UP TO THREE YEARS IN PRISON. HER LAWYERS WILL APPEAL AND CLOSING ARGUMENTS. YESTERDAY THE PROSECUTION SAID GUTIERREZ REID ACT IRRESPONSIBLY WHILE ON THE SET. >>. THIS IS A INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER CHARGE BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T KNOW THERE WERE LIVE ROUNDS ONSET AND THE REASON SHE DIDN'T KNOW WAS THROUGH HER OWN NEGLIGENCE, HER OWN RECKLESSNESS >>. DANNY JOINS US NOW TO BREAK IT DOWN. SO IT TOOK THE JURY TWO AND A HALF HOURS TO ROAST VERDICT GUILTY OF INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER- NOT GUILTY EVIDENCE TAMPERING. ARE YOU SURPRISED OR IS THIS WHAT YOU EXPECTED? >>. I AM NOT SURPRISED AS TO THE TAMPERING. THE ONLY EVIDENCE WAS SOMEONE CAW A WHITE BAG OF POWDER AND IT WAS NEVER TESTED. NOT SURPRISE, SURPRISED THERE. BUT IF THIS WAS A CASE TO BE MADE, IT WAS AGAINST THE AVERAGEORER. THE DEFENSE MISSION WAS TO FINGERS AT EVERYONE ELSE BUT THE STATE'S CASE END UP BEING STRONGER THAN I EXPECTED. THEY HAD A LOT OF PHOTOGRAPHIVE EVIDENCE AND TESTIMONIAL EVIDENCE AND A LOT OF STATEMENTS FROM THE DEFENDANT AND OTHERS, WHICH, BY THE WAY, IF I COULD, DID A PSA AGAIN. THIS CASE WAS BUILT AGAINST THE ARMORER ON BODY CAM VIDEO TO THE POLICE. OR WHEN SHE CAME IN AND SAT DOWN FOR INTERVIEWS, THAT ALL CAME BACK TO HAUNT HER IN- THIS CASE AGAINST HER. SO THERE'S MY PSA. YOU DON'T COOPERATE WITH POLICE INVESTIGATION. IF YOU ARE THE ONE THEY ARE USING IT AGAINST BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE CASE WAS MADE AGAINST THE ARMORER HERE. IF THERE WAS ONE TO BE MADE, SHE HAD THE RESPONSIBILITY. EVEN IF OTHER PEOPLE HARED THE RESPONSIBILITY, SHE WAS THE ARMORER. SO IN THE- A HUGE SURPRISE, THAT IT IS A GUILTY VERDICT- IT WILL BE AGAINST HER. I THINK ALEC BALDWIN IS ACQUITTED. >>. TELL US HOW THE PROSECUTION LAID OUT THE CASE AND WHAT WE HEARD FROM THE CLOSING ARGUMENTS >>. YOU SAW A GREAT CLIP, A GREAT EXAMPLE. THE PROSECUTION USED WAS THAT LOOK. WE ARE NOT SAYING SHE INTENT TENSION, AMLY PUT LIVE ROUNDS ONSET. THAT'S WHAT NEGLIGENCE IS THROUGH HER NEGLIGENCE. THEY INTRODUCED PHOTOGRAPHS OF GUNS BEING USED NEGLECTLY ON THE SET TO CREATE AN ATMOSPHERE. NEGLIGENT ONSET. I THINK THEY DIDN'T DO A GREAT JOB, IS THEY PROMISED WE WILL SHOW YOU WHERE THE LIVE ROUNDS CAME FROM. BUT ULTIMATELY SOME OF THAT EVIDENCE WAS: HEY WHO ELSE COULD THEY HAVE COME FROM BUT THE ARMORER, HANNAH GUTIERREZ-REED. BUT WHATEVER THE CASE, THEY DID MAKE AN. I THOUGHT A GOOD. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DUMMY ROUNDS AND BLANKS AND LIVE ROUNDS ARE SOMETHING. AN ARMORER SHOULD HAVE KNOWN IF SHE WAS CAREFUL AND CHECKING. DUE TO THE NEGLIGENCE ON THE SET, THE LIVE ROUNDS ENDED UP TRAGICALLY IN A FIREARM CAPABLE OF SHOOTING IT. >>. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE DEFENSE AND FIRST SHOW. A MOMENT FROM THE CLOSING ARGUMENTS FROM THE DEFENSE YESTERDAY: >> SHE CANNOT ANTICIPATE WHAT BALDWIN WOULD DOES. IT WAS NOT IN THE SCRIPT AND IN THE FORESEEABLE. MANAGEMENT WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR SAFETY FAILURES AND NOT HANNAH. ZERO EVIDENCE, COCAINE AND NO TESTING. AND AGAIN, I GO BACK TO THE IDEA. SHE IS A SCAPEGOAT FOR THE MANAGEMENT FAILURES. THEY DO HOPE SHE IS CONVICTED, SO THEY ARE EXONERATE AND CAN MOVE FORWARD. >>. THE JURY DIDN'T BUY. THAT WAS IT STRONG. >>. CAN I MAKE MY SECOND PSA? IF YOU WATCH THE FULTON COUNTY HEARINGS IN GEORGIA LAST WEEK YOU SAW PEOPLE COMMIT THE CARDINAL SIN, WHICH IS THE POWER POINT DURING CLOSING WITH LOTS OF WORDS ON IT, AND YOU SAW WAS HIM READING FROM THAT POWER POINT. YOU ARE ASKING A JURY TO READ WHILE YOU READ ALONG AND READ. SHOULD I READ OR LISTEN AND LISTEN TO YOU READING. I THINK THIS IS A CARDINAL SIN THAT YOU SHOULDN'T DO IT. LOOK AT THAT CADENCE YOU SAW IN THE CLIP- NOT VERY DYNAMIC. YOU READ A BOOK FROM A PULPIT- NOT EXCITING. SO THAT'S MY SECOND AND FINAL PSAP BUT THE DEFENSE'S ARGUMENTS THERE WERE REALLY JUST THAT OTHER PEOPLE DID THIS AND THIS WAS OTHER PEOPLE'S RESPONSIBILITIES AND ULTIMATELY THOUGHT IN THE END THE STATE HAD THE STRONGER CASE SHOWING THAT EVEN FOR PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE, THEY CONCEDED THAT'S AN EFFECTIVE TOOL. TO THE STATE THEY SAY THE DEFENSE WILL SAY IT WAS OTHER POOL'S RESPONSIBILITY AND THAT THE ARMORER WAS OVERWHELMED AND THOSE ARE GOOD POINTS BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY THE ARMORER- HER NAME MEANS SHE- IS INVOLVED AND HAS PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SAFETY OF THE FIREARMS AND THE FIREARMS WERE NOT SAFE, OBVIOUSLY. >> SPEAKING OF OTHER PEOPLE. THIS RAISES THE QUESTION NOW ALEC BALDWIN CHARGED WITH INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER AND HE SAID HE DID NOT PULL THE TRIGGER. WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCES AND WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENCES IN THESE TWO CASES? >> FIRST GUILTY VERDICT WAS GOOD FOR ALEC BALDWIN AND AN ACQUITA ACQUITTAL WOULD HAVE BEEN GOOD ALL AROUND PLUS FOR ALEC BALDWIN. HIS CASE IS A LOT DIFFERENT. HE DIDN'T HAVE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY AND KEY IS GOING TO BE THE OPERABILITY OF THE FIRE ARM. THE BEST EVIDENCE IS STUPID STATEMENTS. HE GAVE NUMBER ONE THAT HE WOULD NEVER POINT A GUN AT ANYONE AND NUMBER TWO THAT HE DIDN'T PULL THE TRIGGER. THOSE TWO WERE DUMB THINGS TO SAY. THEY WILL BE EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM. >>. DANNY, APPRECIATE YOUR ANALYSIS, THANKS. >>>. TONIGHT, PRESIDENT BIDEN WILL DELIVER HIS HIGH STAKES STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS AS A REMATCH TAKES SHAPE AGAINST THE PRESUMPTIVE GOP NOMINEE, DONALD TRUMP. >>. HE HOPES TO WIN OVER DOUBTERS AND GIVE THE REELECTION CAMPAIGN A SHOT IN THE ARM. HIS GOAL HIGHLIGHT ACCOMPLISHMENTS OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS AND LAY OUT THE CHOICE FACING VOTERS IN NOVEMBER. FOR MORE ON WHAT TO EXPECT, WE ARE JOINED BY NBC NEWS WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT MONICA ALBA AND RYAN NOBLES. GOOD MORNING TO BOTH OF YOU. >>. THIS IS THE LATEST IN THE YEAR. WHAT CAN WE EXPECT? >>. Reporter, YOU SAID THE STAKES ARE HIGH, THE SPEECH IS VERY LONG AND SOME OF THE MOMENTS THAT MIGHT BE THE KEY TACK AWAYS ARE SOME OF THE UNPREDICTABLE ONES THINGS THE WHITE HOUSE CAN'T PLAN FOR, BUT MAYBE DISCUSS SOMETHING HOW TO HANDLE IF THEY TAKE PLACE. AND THOSE ARE JUST SOME OF THE SPONTANEOUS MOMENTS, REACTIONS IN THE DAY, BUT IN TERMS OF THE CONTENT OF THE SPEECH AND SUBSTANCE, THIS IS BIDE ANN OPPORTUNITY. THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS TO PUT EVERYTHING HE ACCOMPLISHED IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS IN ONE BUCKET AND TRY TO FRAME WHY HE WANTS TO DO THAT IN ANOTHER FOUR YEARS, FOR HIS REELECTION, IN A SEPARATE BUCKET. AND TRY TO MARRY THE TWO AND DISCUSS IT DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY. THIS IS MORE WHAT WE CAN EXPECT FROM THE MESSAGE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY YESTERDAY >>. YOU WILL HEAR THE PRESIDENT LAY OUT THE HISTORIC ACHIEVEMENTS HE DELIVERED ON FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND HIS VISION FOR THE FUTURE. THE PRESIDENT WILL OUTLOIN LOON AGENDA ABOUT CONTINUING TO THE PROGRESS, AND WE HAS ALWAYS BEEN AN OPTIMISTIC PERSON AND EVEN IN THE FACE OF CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US, HE WILL SHARE WHY HE IS HOPEFUL ABOUT THIS COUNTRY'S FUTURE >>. Reporter. A MAJOR THEME IS THE PRESIDENT TALKING ABOUT TRYING TO LOWER COSTS FOR AMERICANS, EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY NOT BE FEELING ALL THE EFFECTS OF THAT, AND THEN ALSO TO TOP OUT ECONOMIC PLANS WHILE OF COURSE, TRYING TO ISSUES OF THE OTHER SIDE OF REPUBLICANS. BUT HE IS GOING TO BE DISCUSSING WITHOUT MENTIONING NECESSARILY THE NAME OF HIS GENERAL ELECTION OPPONENT. NOW, THAT IS SET OF COURSE FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP >>. SO LET'S BRING YOU IN HERE, RYAN. HE WILL DELIVER THE SPEECH BETWEEN A DIVIDED CONGRESS AND REPUBLICAN SPEAKER, MIKE JOHNSON, FIRST STATE OF THE UNION THAT WILL BE IN VIEW OF THE CAMERAS THE ENTIRE TIME. WHAT HAS HE BEEN SAYING ABOUT THIS? >>? Reporter. HE HAS BEEN CLEAR. HE BELIEVES THERE'S A VERY DIFFERENT VISION FOR AMERICA BETWEEN REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS, AND WE WILL SEE THAT ON DISPLAY IN THE CHAMBER WHERE MAYBE ONLY HALF OF THE AUDIENCE IS STANDING AND APPLAUDING AT CERTAIN POINTS DURING THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH. JOHNSON DID A PREBUT THEEL YESTERDAY WHERE HE LAID OUT THE BIG DIFFERENCES HE SEES BETWEEN THE REPUBLICAN VISION AND THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION'S VISION. TAKE A LISTEN HOW HE RESPONDED. >>. IF YOU HAD TO DESCRIBE IN ONE WORD WHAT YOU BELIEVE IS THE STATE OF THE UNION, IS YOU HEARD THE WORD CRISIS, AND A SUMMARY IS DECLINE AND SAY GREAT SADS IN. WE DO, BECAUSE OF THIS PRESIDENT, HIS ADMINISTRATION, THAT WE ARE INDUCE MUTABLY IN DECLINED >> REPUBLICANS PAINTING A DIFFERENT PICTURE OF WHAT THE STATE OF THE UNION IS, AND PRESIDENT BIDEN IS GOING TO HOPE TO DO IS DEMONSTRATE ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT HIS ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN ABLE TO GET OVER THE FINISH LINE OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS, WHILE REPUBLICANS WILL SAY MUCH HAS NOT WORKED AND THAT'S WHY THEY BELIEVE IT WILL BE PRESIDENT BIDEN'S FINAL STATE OF THE UNION JOE >>. MONICA IMMIGRATION AND THE ON GOING SITUATION AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER IS EXPECTED TO BE A BIG FOCAL POINT FOR THE WHAT. WHAT TO YOU THINK WE WILL HEAR >>. Reporter. HE WILL TAKE REPUBLICANS TO TASK. HE IS GOING TO ARGUE FOR TORPEDOING THE BIPARTISAN DEAL THAT WAS ON THE TABLE, THAT REALLY WOULD HAVE BEEN THE TOUGH OF THE REFORM TO THE CURRENT IMMIGRATION SYSTEM, WHICH THE PRESIDENT, BY THE WAY, SAYS IS BROKEN AND WHICH WOULD HAVE PROVIDED ESSENTIAL FUNDING FOR PERSONNEL AND ADDITIONAL BORDER SECURITY. I THINK THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO SAY SOMETHING LIKE: WE PUT THIS ON THE TABLE AND WE HAD MEMBERS OF BOTH PARTIES WORK ON IT FOR MONTHS AND THERE'S NEGOTIATIONS. AT THE END OF THE DAY, REPUBLICANS DIDN'T DECIDE TO BACK IT BECAUSE OF COMMENTS HE MAY LINK OR ALLUDE TO FROM THE FORMER PRESIDENT. HE WILL BE CLEAR ABOUT THAT. EVEN THOUGH, WE ARE REPORTING THAT HE IS NOT EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE ANY EXECUTIVE ACTION WHEN IT COMES TO IMMIGRATION EVEN THOUGH, THAT'S SOMETHING THE ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN CONSIDERING AND IS POSSIBLE THEY COULD DO THAT AT LATER DATE. I AM TOLD THEY AGREED THEY CAN'T DO NOTHING WHEN IT COMES TO THE BORDER. SOMETHINGS HAVE TO HAPPEN IF CONGRESS CAN'T ACT >>. OF COURSE, AFTER THE SPEECH WE WILL HEAR REPUBLICAN RESPONSE AS DELIVERED BY ALABAMA SOMEBODYTER KATIE BRITT. A LOT OF VIEWERS MAY -- SENATOR KATIE BRITT, A LOT OF VIEWERS MAY NOT KNOW >>. A 42-YEAR-OLD MOTHER, ONE OF THE YOUNGEST MEMBERS OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE, AND SOMEONE WHO IS ARTICULATE AND SOMEONE WHO REPUBLICANS REALLY BELIEVE CAN SHARE WHAT THEY BELIEVE IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE REPUBLICAN AGENDA AND THE DEMOCRATIC AGENDA. OF COURSE, THE SPOTS IS A SOUGHT AFTER SPOT BUT IT'S AN ENORMOUS CHALLENGE AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO REPLICATE THE POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE OF WHEN HAPPENS INSIDE THE CHAMBER, WITH A SPEECH DELIVERED IN A VERY QUIET ROOM DIRECTLY TO CAMERA, WITHOUT APPLAUSE AND ENERGY INSIDE THE CHAMBER BUT MANY BELIEVE BRITT IS UP TO THE TASK. SHE IS SOMEONE WHO REPUBLICANS HAVE A VERY BRIGHT FUTURE. SHE HASN'T SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN THE MEDIA SPOTLIGHT AND WORKED A LOT BEHIND THE SCENES, AND THIS IS HER MOMENT TO INTRODUCE HERSELF TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC >>. THIS IS SORT ESSENTIALLY THE BIDEN LAUNCH OF A GENERAL ELECTION CAMPAIGN. NOW WE HAVE PRESUMPTIVE UNTIL KNOW IN FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP, WHILE EXACTLY WHAT HE SAYS MIGHT NOT NECESSARILY BE REMEMBERED BY A LOT OF VOTERS, A LOT OF PEOPLE AT HOME. HOW HE SAYS IT, PERFORMANCE HIS DEMEANOR MIGHT BE ESPECIALLY AS QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS AGE LINGER. HOW MUCH OF A CONCERN AND FOCUS IS THAT TONIGHT? >>. Reporter WELL, THE WHITE HOUSE WOULD SAY: YOU WILL SEE AN ENERGIZED PRESIDENT TONIGHT WHO IS GOING TO REALLY PUT THE CONCERNS TO REST. THAT'S HOW THEY FRAME IT, BECAUSE IT IS A SPEECH- A TELEPROMPTER SPEECH- AND HE HAS BEEN PRACTICING FOR SEVERAL DAYS. FOR YEARS HE TALKED ABOUT THIS AND STRUGGLED WITH STUTTERING AND HAS THE ISSUES WITH HIS DELIVERY BUT BECAUSE THEY HAVE PUT THE PRESS INTO THIS, THEY DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE PART OF IT. BUT HOW THEY COUNTER THE LARGER CONCERNS, WHICH WE SEE REFLECTED IN THE POLLS, IS TO GO SEND THE PRESIDENT ON THE ROAD AND TRAVEL. HE IS GOING TO BE IN PHILADELPHIA TOMORROW. HE IS GOING TO BE IN ATLANTA ON SATURDAY AND I AM TOLD AFTER THE STATE OF THE UNION. THERE'S GOING TO BE A MASSIVE TRAVEL BLITZ. WE WILL SEE THE PRESIDENT OUT THERE ENGAGING VOTERS IN MORE PERSONAL WAY THAN WE HAVE SEEN IN RECENT WEEKS. SAVANNAH AND JOE- >>. THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH. >>> FOR MORE ON STATE OF THE. AN DOWNDAVID IS THE FORMER SPEECH WRITER FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA AND BEST SELLING AUTHOR. GOOD TO HAVE YOU NO ONE BETTER TO HELP US UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. STAKES ARE HIGH, ESPECIALLY IN AN ELECTION YEAR, AND WHEN PRESIDENT BIDEN LOOKS AT THE POLLS AND WANTS TO BE DOING BETTER, WHAT DO YOU EXPECT? >>. THANKS FOR HAVING ME AND I THINK THAT TONIGHT- YOU KNOW SPEECH WRITER. I THOUGHT ESPECIALLY BECAUSE I WAS A TEAM OF EIGHT AND THE STATE OF THE UNION IS MORE THAN ONE NIGHT- BECAUSE FOR US IN THE SPEECH WRITING OFFICE FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA, WE WOULD LOOK AT THE STATE OF THE UNION AS GUIDE FOR THE NEXT THREE TO SIX MONTHS. A SPEECH IS COMING. WHAT DID THEY SAY ABOUT THAT? THAT'S A WAY FOR US AND PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE GOVERNMENT TO THINK ABOUT THE STORY. THE PRESIDENT WANTED TO TELL ABOUT THE COUNTRY AND MOMENT. YOU POINTED OUT ABOUT THE UPCOMING ELECTION >>. WALK US THROUGH. WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW, MAYBE WHAT'S GOING ON THE PAST FEW DAYS- THE PART OF THE SPEECH WRITING AND PART OF OBAMA'S. HOW DO YOU INTERACT WITH THE PRESIDENT AND HOW IS PREPARING AND WHEN IT CULMINATES IN TONIGHT? >>. EVERY PRESIDENT IS DIFFERENT, BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU HEARD FROM PRESIDENT BIDEN'S TEAM. THE PRESIDENT IS REALLY INVOLVED IN HIS OWN STATE OF THE UNION. HE HAS A SPEECH WRITER AND THEY ARE WORKING TOGETHER. BUT REALLY, THIS COMES DOWN TO THE PRESIDENT. HE IS TALKING WITH THE PERSON AND GOING BACK AND FORTH AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. HOW DO I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS, WHAT IS THE VISION AND WHAT'S ON MY MIND, BECAUSE IT'S VERY RARE THESE DAYS. WE KNOW THAT MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WILL BE WATCHING A SPEECH USUALLY AT THIS ON THE. WE ARE WATCHING CLIPS AND MAYBE 30 SECONDS OR LESS. SO THE IDEA, I THINK LAST YEAR 27 MILLION AMERICANS WATCHED THE STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS. THAT BIG AN AUDIENCE IS REALLY HARD TO GET, EVEN FOR A PRESIDENT. THESE DAYS >>. YOU ARE A WRITER SO CLEARLY. THE WORDS ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT BUT WE CAN'T IGNORE WHAT THE POLLS TELL US. PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT HIS AGE. HOW IMPORTANT IS THE PERFORMANCE GOING TO BE HERE TONIGHT >>. WELL THINK PERFORMANCE IS ALWAYS IMPORTANT BUT I ALSO THINK THAT PART OF THE WHITE HOUSE'S JOB AND PART WHAT HAVE YOU SEE FROM THE BIDEN TEAM IS WE NEED TO GET PAST FEWER CRITICISM. THE ELECTION IS NOT ABOUT JOE BIDEN OR DONALD TRUMP. IN ANY ELECTION IT'S ABOUT WHAT ARE OUR NEXT FOUR YEARS GOING TO LOOK LIKE. AND I THINK PART OF WHAT YOU WILL SEE PRESIDENT BIDEN DO TONIGHT IS LAY OUT A VISION FOR THE NEXT FOUR YEARS, NOT HIS FOUR NEXT YEARS. HE WILL BE FINE. HE IS A SUCCESSFUL GUY. WHAT ARE THE REST OF US GOING TO EXPERIENCE. AND THE OTHER THING I WILL SAY ABOUT THIS IS. I WOULD LOOK FOR UNSCRIPTED MOMENTS. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER LAST YEAR THERE WAS HECKLING. I DON'T KNOW WHEN IT BECAME NORMAL, BUT IT DID. I THINK WE WILL SEE SOME OF THOSE MOMENTS. FRANKLY- THINK WE ARE. BIDEN WAS AT HIS BEST LAST YEAR. THE SPEECH ITSELF WAS GOOD BUT HE ALSO- YOU KNOW HE- COULD DISH IT BACK AND I THINK THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT YOU KNOW. MAYBE CHARITY BY SOME OF THE REPUBLICAN FRIENDS MIGHT PORTEND. HE IS NOT CAPABLE OF. >> THAT PART OF THE PREP HOW TO HANDLE HECKLING >>I DON'T KNOW. SO I THINK HE'S BEEN DOING IT A LONG TIME BUT THAT ABILITY TO SHOW POISE AND YOU KNOW THAT UNSCRIPTED MOMENT CAN BE JUST AS POWERFUL AS THE THINGS THAT THE SO MUCH WRITERS HAVE BEEN WORKING ON. >>. THANKS FOR JOINING US THIS MORNING. WE APPRECIATE IT. >>. THANKS FOR HAVING ME. >>> PREVIEWING THE STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS THROUGHOUT THE DAY HERE ON NBC NEWS NOW AND IN THE IVE LIVE COVERAGE GETS UNDERWAY TONIGHT. >>>. ALABAMA REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR SIGNED A BILL INTO LAW PROTECTING IVF CLINICS, PROTECTING PROVIDERS AND PATIENTS FROM LAWSUITS IF EMBRYOS ARE DESTROYED. IN THE WAKE OF THE RULING FROM THE STATE SUPREME COURT LAST MONTH THAT FROZEN EMBRYOS ARE PEOPLE UNDER LAW >>. THE NEW BILL WILL ALLOW CLINICS TO RESTART TREATMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN ON HOLD AND PASSED, WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND GOVERNOR IVEY SOUND IT MOMENTS AFTER HITTING THE DESK. CRITICS SAY IT DOESN'T GO FAR ENOUGH, BUT TWO CLINICS IN THE STATE ARE PREPARED TO RESUME TREATMENTS AS SOON AS THIS WEEK. >>>. IN CAIRO, CEASE-FIRE TOMS TALKS AIMED AT HALTING THE WAR IN GAZA AND RELEASING ISRAELI HOSTAGES AND PALESTINIAN PRISONERS HAVE STALLED WITHOUT A BREAKTHROUGH. IN REPORTS SAY REPRESENTATIVES OF HAMAS LEFT CAIRO BUT TALKS WOULD CONTINUE TO TRY TO REACH A DEAL BY THE START OF RAMADAN ON SUNDAY. INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE IS MOUNTING ON ISRAEL TO ALLOW MORE AID INTO GAZA. THEY ARE LOOKING AT NEW ROUTE TO GET AID TO GAZA. STARVING POPULATION >>. HUNGER REACHED CATASTROPHIC LEVELS AND ESPECIALLY IN NORTH OF GAZA, WHICH WE HAVEN'T SCALED FOR WEEKS, NEED TO SCALE UP HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE AND THAT'S THE --. WE HAVE TO USE THIS MILITARY ROAD, THIS THE SITE ON THE EASTERN SIDE, TO ALLOW THEM TO COME FROM THE CROSSING POINT AND RAFAH UP TO THE NORTH AND INTO THE NORTH. >>. NBC NEWS INTERNATIONAL POURS CORRESPONDENT RAF SANCHEZ JOINS US. LET'S TALK WITH THE CEASE-FIRE TALKS. ANY CHANCE. A DEAL IS LIKELY BY THE WEEKEND >>. Reporter. IT'S LOOKING VERY UNLOCKLY. THE TALKS IN CAIRO HAVE BROKEN UP NOW WITHOUT A BREAKTHROUGH. IT'S NOT CLEAR WHEN WE ARE NEXT GOING TO SEE NEGOTIATOR GETTING BACK TO THE TABLE AND THESE TALKS BROKE UP. IT IS SOUNDING LIKE BOTH SIDES WERE PRETTY MUCH AT ZERO CONDITIONS. YOU WILL REMEMBER ISRAEL, THE US, EGYPT AND QATAR WITHIN THE TO PARIS AND HAMMERED OUT A FRAMEWORK. THAT FRAMEWORK WAS PRESENTED TO HAMAS AND THE HOPE WAS THEY MIGHT SAY YES. BUT HAMAS CAME BACK WITH A COUNTER PROPOSAL, WITH A LOT OF THEIR ORIGINAL POSITIONS, INCLUDING A DEMAND TO END THE WAR ENTIRELY. AND SOMETHING, ISRAEL SAYS THEY DON'T DO UNTIL HAMAS IS DESTROYED AND WITHDRAW ALL ISRAELI FORCES FROM THE GAZA STRIP. SOMETHING, ISRAEL SAYS IT IS NOT WILLING TO DO SO FOR THOSE PAL, PALESTINIAN CIVILIANS: A SHORTAGE OF FOOD AND HOSTAGES. NO BREAKTHROUGH >>. UN AND RELIEF AGENCIES SAYS ISRAEL IS BLOCKING AID FROM GETTING NO GAZA, WHERE STARVATION IS BECOMING A HUGE CONCERN TALK ABOUT THIS GROWING PRESSURE ON ISRAEL TO LET MORE AID IN AND HOW ISRAEL IS RESPONDING TO ALL OF THIS >>. Reporter. SO THE PRESSURE ON ISRAEL IS: GET MORE AID IN TO GAZA BUT ALSO TO MAKE SURE THE CONDITIONS EXIST INSIDE THE STRIP SO THAT AID CAN BE DISTRIBUTED. YOU HEARD FROM THAT UN REPRESENTATIVE. EARLIER BIG PROBLEM IS NORTHERN GAZA, WHERE, ACCORDING TO HUMANITARIAN GROUPS, ISRAEL ILMILITARY RESTRICT AND COLLAPSE OF LAW AND ORDER ARE MAKING IT VERY DIFFICULT TO GET THAT AID OUT. I ASKED AN ISRAELI GOVERNMENT SPOKESMAN ABOUT ISRAEL'S RESPONSIBILITY TO MACK. SURE AID CAN BE DISTRIBUTED. TAKE A LISTEN TO A LITTLE OF THAT CONVERSATION. >> YOU SAY ISRAEL IS FAILING. >> I CAN'T ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF LAW AND ORDER, BECAUSE THAT'S NOT A QUESTION. BUT I CAN TELL YOU, IN TERMS OF SECURING THE CONVOYS, THAT'S SOMETHING. THE INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEY ARE. >>. Reporter, HOW CAN THEY BE RESPONSIBLE? THEY DON'T HAVE WEAPONS. >> THERE ARE WAYS TO SECURE THE CONVOYS IN THE SAME WAY IN MANY DIFFERENT PLACES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD WHERE THEY HAVE DELIVER HUMANITARIAN AID, AND IT'S THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO DO SO IN THIS SITUATION >>. Reporter, YOU HEARD ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS SAYING AGAIN AND AGAIN: ISRAEL NEEDS TO DO MORE, TO GET AID INTO NORTHERN GAZA AND LIKELY TO BE A MESSAGE REPEATED TONIGHT AT THE STATE OF THE UNION. >> ISRAEL RECEIVED CONDEMNATION AFTER -- THAT'S CONSIDERED ILLEGAL ON INTERNATIONAL LAW. TELL US MORE ABOUT THIS, EXPLAIN IT TO US AND TELL US WHAT WE ARE HEARING FROM THE UNITED STATES. WHAT'S THE REACTION ON THIS? >> Reporter. SO FROM THE STATE? >> Reporter, SO FROM THE STATE STATE DEPARTMENT. WE ARE HEARING RELATIVELY STANDARD LANGUAGE. THEY ARE SAYING IT'S BARRIER TO THE TWO-STATE SOLUTION AND CONTRARY TO INTERNATIONAL LAW. BUT WHAT WE SEE IS OCCUPIED WEST BANK GETTING BERG AND BIDEN. ADMINISTRATION NOT TAKING MEASURES TO SANCTIONS ISRAELI GOVERNMENT FOR THE SET ESPECIALLYMENT EXPANSIONS. WE HAVE SEEN THE ADMINISTRATION PUT SANCTIONS ON INDIVIDUAL SETTLERS WILL IN THE WEST BANK ACCUSED OF COMMITTING ACTS OF VIOLENCE AGAINST PALESTINIAN CIVILIANS, BUT NO ACTION AGAINST THE SETTLEMENTS THEMSELVES. THERE HAD BEEN SOMETHING OF A PAUSE ON THE GROWTH OF SETTLEMENTS BUT THIS RIGHT WING GOVERNMENT UNDER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, DETERMINED TO KEEP EXPANDING THEM. >>. THANKS SO MUCH. >> THANKS SO MUCH >>>. TIME FOR A CHECK ON YOUR MORNING NEWS. NOW WEATHER >>. YESTERDAY IT WAS ABOUT THE RAIN AND PARTS OF THE- LET'S SAY THE WHOLE THIRD OF THE EASTERN PART OF OUR COUNTRY AND INSTEAD TODAY A GENERAL DRYING TREND. WE STILL HAVE A COUPLE OF SPOTS THAT ARE PICKING UP ADDITIONAL RAIN BUT THE SYSTEM IS ON THE WAY OUT NEW YORK, WASHINGTON, DC, STRETCHING TO THE CAROLINAS. WE WILL SEE DRIER CONDITIONS THROUGH HERE, THROUGH THE REST OF THE DAY. NORTHERN PORTION OF NEW ENGLAND IS WHERE WE ARE DEALING WITH MORE OF THE RAIN THAT WILL START TO WRAP UP HERE EVEN AS WE GET CLOSER TO LUNCHTIME AND, BECAUSE OF THIS ADDITIONAL RAIN, STILL DEALING WITH A COUPLE OF FLOOD WATCHES THAT ARE IN EFFECT FOR PARTS OF NEW HAMPSHIRE AND MAINE. THAT'S IT. ALL THE OTHER EXPIRED. NOW, AS WE GET RID OF THAT SYSTEM, WE HAVE THE NEXT ONE. WE WILL WATCH THROUGH THE MIDDLE, THE COUNTRY TODAY, ADDITIONAL SNOW ACROSS PARTS OF THE ROCKIES. WE HAVE GOT SOME RAIN TO DEAL WITH AND SOME STRONG STORMS THAT WE WILL HAVE TO TRACK, GETTING INTO THE LATER PARTS OF TODAY AND AFTER DARK TONIGHT. WE WILL SHOW YOU IN A MOMENT, AS WE LOOK AHEAD TO TOMORROW, THE SYSTEM IN THE GREAT LAKES AND HEAVY RAIN AND STRONG STORMS ACROSS THE SOUTH AS WELL. AND THIS SYSTEM IS NOT DONE AS WE GET THROUGH THE FRIDAY. BY SATURDAY IT WORKS A LITTLE FARTHER TO THE EAST AND WE HAVE GOT SOGGY CONDITIONS ON TAP AND THE POTENTIAL OF A COUPLE MORE STRONG STORMS ACROSS PARTS OF THE SOUTH. SO LET'S START WITH TODAY. THIS AFTERNOON AND INTO THE EVENING, WE HAVE GOT 6 MILLION PEOPLE UNDER THIS RISK OF SEEING SOME OF THE STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS. WHAT DO WE HAVE AS FAR AS IMPACTS? HAIL IS THE THING WE WATCH FOR TO HAVE THE GREATEST CHANCE OF OCCURRING. AN INCH OR LARGER IS POSSIBLE. WE WILL SEE THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME OF THE STRONGER WIND GUSTS. WE CAN'T RULE OUT A TORNADO OR TWO BY TOMORROW, A LARGER AREA AT RISK FOR SOME OF THE STRONGER STORMS AGAIN AFTERNOON AND EVENING AFTER DARK. WE COULD BE TALKING ABOUT TORNADOES AND WE KNOW HOW MUCH MORE DANG ROUSE THEY ARE ONCE IT IS DARK. 20 MILLION PEOPLE AT RISK, INCLUDING DALLAS, JACKSON MOBILE, NEW ORLEANS- ALL INCLUDED IN THAT. FOR TOMORROW, SAME IMPACTS WILL REMAIN AND WE HAVE SOME HEAVY RAIN. WE WILL TRACK TOO LOCALIZED AMOUNTS 4 TO 8 INCHES, WIDESPREAD RAIN AN-CH TO 2 INCHES BUT THE FLOODING CONCERN WILL BE ACROSS THE REGION HERE AS WE GET THROUGH. FRIDAY GUYS >>. NEVER A DULL MOMENT IN THE WEATHER DEPARTMENT. >> LOTS OF RAIN THIS WEEK TOO >> AND HAIL THANK YOU. >>>.

PRESIDENT ZELENSKY STATED THE EXPLOSION LEFT AN UNKNOWN NUMBER OF PEOPLE DEAD AND WOUNDED, WHILE THEY PRIME MINISTER STATED: IT IS ONE THING TO HEAR ABOUT WAR AND QUITE ANOTHER TO EXPERIENCE IT FIRSTHAND. THE ATTRACTION INCLUDES THE MEMORIAL SITE OF THE MOST RECENT MAJOR ATTACK ON THE CITY. NOW TO MEXICO CITY, WHERE PROTESTERS USED A PICKUP TRUCK TO RAM DOWN THE DOORS. THEY WERE ABLE TO ANSWER.

WE ARE GOING TO TARGET EVERY CRIMINAL CODE ON THE BOOKS. >>. Reporter. IN SAN FRANCISCO, VOTERS PASSED TWO MEASURES AND OUTLINE ORDER- INCLUDING SAVANNA -- EXPANDING CAMERAS AND DRONES. THEY CAN SEE EVERY STATION APPEARS TO BE A LAX SYSTEM. THAT APPEARS TO BE A LAX SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS INDIVIDUALS TO COMMIT EVEN THE MOST VIOLENT OFFENSES TO CONTINUALLY BE ALLOWED BACK ON THE STREETS, AND IT IS REALLY CAUSING A LOT OF DURESS AND STRESS OUT ON THE STREETS AND INCREASING OUR CRIME RATES. I THINK CORRECTLY, FOCUSING ON THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PUTTING THOSE PEOPLE BACK ON THE STREETS IS REALLY A GOOD STRATEGY. >>. THE GOVERNOR SAYS THIS NEW PLAN IS ABSOLUTELY DIFFERENT, ABSOLUTELY A DIFFERENT. DYNAMIC FROM NYPD IS VERY CONTROVERSIAL: STOP AND FRISK POLICIES. THOSE WERE FOUND TO BE DISCRIMINATORY AND WERE LATER RULED UNCONSTITUTIONAL. HOW ARE THESE BAG CHECKS DIFFERENT? >>. I THINK THIS WHOLE OPERATION IS AN EXPANSION OF COLLABORATION THAT EXISTED FROM OCTOBER OF 2022 BETWEEN THE CITY AND THE STATE. THE SAME RESOURCES WERE PROVIDED TO THE CITY, JUST BASED ON THE MAYORS SUBWAY SAFETY PLAN BACK THEN. THE MAIN DIFFERENCE HERE NOW IS THAT THE DEPLOYMENT OF STATE RESOURCES, THE STATE POLICE AND THE NATIONAL GUARD ARE MOVING FROM JUST THE FOUR MAJOR TRANSPORTATION HUBS THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM, AND THEY HAVE INTRODUCED THESE BAG CHECKS. WHAT THEY HAVE INDICATED IS THAT THE BAG CHECKS WILL BE RANDOMIZED BAGS, AND THAT MEANS YOU MAY BE STOPPING. EVERY 10th PERSON IS -- REGARDLESS OF RACE, COLOR- A CERTAIN PATTERN OF INDIVIDUALS, AND THAT WILL PREVENT IT FROM BEING IN THE POSSIBILITY OF TARGETING INDIVIDUALS IN THE SYSTEM ITSELF. IT IS AN EXPANSION OF A WONDERFUL COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE CITY AND THE STATE WITH A TWIST, AND THAT'S WHAT DRIVES US EVERY MORNING BECAUSE EVERY DAY MORNING, BECAUSE EVERY DAY DESERVES THE BEST START >>>.

HOW IS THE ECONOMY PERFORMING? >> WE ARE AT THE BIG BOARD. NO MATTER HOW MANY ISSUES WE TALK ABOUT DURING AN ELECTION- IT'S THE ECONOMY. WHAT DOES THE ECONOMY LOOK LIKE RIGHT NOW UNDER PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN? >>. THAT IS WHY THE STATE OF THE ECONOMY WITH IS LIKELY TO BE PART OF THE STATE OF THE UNION. UNEMPLOYMENT IS 3.7%, WHICH IS NEAR A 50 YEAR LOW. THE BIG STORY IS INFLATION. THE BIG STORY IS INFLATION CROSSES, GOING UP 3.1%. THERE IS A LOT OF WORK TO DO THERE. THE STORY IS: WE ARE GROWING. THE ECONOMY IS GROWING BY 3.1% IN 2023- OVER THAT. DURING PREVIOUS YEARS, WE DID NOT CONTRACT WORK. THE STORY IS INFLATION. THAT'S THE ISSUE FOR THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION. >>. HOW ARE VOTERS FEELING ABOUT THE ECONOMY? >>. POLLING SHOWS: THE ECONOMY IS TOP OF MIND. PEOPLE WERE ASKED COMPARED TO THIS TIME ONE YEAR AGO. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE ECONOMY? 40% SAY WORSE. LOOKING AT THOSE NUMBERS, THEY HAVE IMPROVED FROM LAST YEAR. UNEMPLOYMENT WAS THE SAME BUT INFLATION WAS WORSE IN 2022.. THE STORY IS THAT PEOPLE ARE PERCEIVING THE ECONOMY TO BE WORSE IS BECAUSE PUB FOOD PRICES. THE NUMBER IS GOING DOWN, BUT IT IS STILL POSITIVE, SO PRICES ARE GOING UP AT A SLOWER PACE. PEOPLE ARE STILL SEEING PRICE TAGS RISE IN THE STORE, SO THE PERCEPTION OF THE ECONOMY IS THE WAY IT IS. >>. WHAT ECONOMIC POLICIES DO WE EXPECT TO BE TALKED ABOUT? >>.

INFRASTRUCTURE BUILDING ROAD- ANTITRUST- LIKE THE SPIRIT DEAL AND DRUG PRICES- IS ALSO PART OF THE INFLATION REDUCTION ACT AND STUDENT LOANS TO HAVE DEBT EXPELLED. THESE REMAIN THE ISSUES THAT HE WILL TALK ABOUT OR IS LIKELY TO TALK ABOUT TONIGHT >>. YOU SHOW THE COMPARISONS OF A YEAR OR SO AGO, ALSO DURING PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN'S TERM. AFTER THE SUPER TUESDAY, FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP SAID HIS RECORD WAS BETTER. SHOWS THOSE NUMBERS >>. YES, LOOKING AT THE NUMBERS, YOU CAN'T ATTRIBUTE EVERYTHING JUST A ONE PRESIDENT. THERE ARE OTHER FACTORS IN PLAY. LET'S LOOK AT THE PRE-COVID NUMBERS. THIS IS 2020.. UNEMPLOYMENT: 3.6% AND INFLATION 2.5%. RIGHT, NOW WE ARE 3.7 ON UNEMPLOYMENT, AND THAT IS A SLIGHT MOVEMENT, AND INFLATION IS CERTAINLY HIGHER AT 3.1%. OVERALL, IT LOOKS ABOUT THE SAME. THE CONTEXT IS NOT REALLY OF JUST THE CAUSE ITSELF BUT WE WENT THROUGH A PANDEMIC IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT, UNEMPLOYMENT WENT TO 15.8% AND INFLATION WAS AS HIGH AS NINE%. COVID HAPPENING IS NOT THE FAULT OF EITHER PRESIDENT. THIS IS WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT WITH THE ECONOMY. IT IS A MASSIVE THING THAT WE WENT THROUGH IN 2020.. WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE NUMBERS. >> THANK YOU FOR LAYING THOSE NUMBERS OUT. YOU CAN WATCH A STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS TONIGHT RIGHT HERE ON NBC NEWS NOW AND YOU CAN FOLLOW REACTION ON NBC NEWSCOM: >>> KNOWS. LET'S GET TO HANNAH REED.

WE REACHED OUT TO ALEC BALDWIN'S ATTORNEY FOR COMMENT, BUT WE HAVE NOT HEARD BACK. HE IS GEARING UP FOR HIS CRIMINAL TRIAL SET TO BEGIN IN NEW MEXICO THIS JULY. >>. LET'S BRING IN OUR LEGAL ANALYST FIRST PERSPECTIVE ON THE VERDICT. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. I WANT TO START WITH YESTERDAY'S VERDICT AND THE FACT THAT, THROUGHOUT THE TRIAL, WE DID NOT ACTUALLY SEE HER TAKE THIS. DAN DID THAT HELP OR HURT HER? >>. THIS IS WORST CASE SCENARIO FOR HER, BUT IT WOULD'VE BEEN WORSE. HAD SHE TAKEN A STAND, SHE WOULD'VE HAD TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. LIKE WAS THAT OKAY. SHE COULD HAVE PROVEN THAT THERE WAS SOME REASONABLE DOUBT. THERE WAS COCAINE INVOLVED. THE EVIDENCE TAMPERING WAS NOT FOUND GUILTY. IN TERMS OF WHAT THE JURY FOUND, IT WAS A STRONG CASE. SHE NOT ONLY MESSED UP ENORMOUSLY IN LOADING THE GUN- ALSO A PATTERN OF NEGLECT. THE PROSECUTOR SAID THERE WERE 12 DAYS WHERE. THERE WERE LIVE ROUNDS ON THE SET AND SHE AS THE PERSON IN CHARGE, SHE DIDN'T KNOW. WE HEARD POWERFUL TESTIMONY OF PEOPLE SAYING SHE WAS PULLING AMMO OUT OF HER FANNY PACK AND THAT IS NOT WHAT HAPPENS ON A MOVIE SET. >>. LET'S TALK ABOUT ALEC BALDWIN. HE IS PLEADED, NOT GUILTY, AND SAYS HE DID NOT PULL THE TRIGGER. HE WILL GO TO TRIAL THIS JULY. HOW ARE THESE CASES DIFFERENT? DOES BALDWIN HAVE A BETTER CASE? >>. I THINK HE DOES. I THINK THIS COULD POSSIBLY HELP HIM, BECAUSE THE DEFENSE ATTORNEYS COULD USE THE PROSECUTOR'S OWN WORDS HERE AGAINST THE PROSECUTOR. THE PROSECUTION SAID IT WAS HER SOLE RESPONSIBILITY AND SHE MESSED UP AND THE JURY FOUND HER GUILTY. THEN THE TEAM COULD SAY: DAVE, ALL ARE READY, PLED, GUILTY AND WAS FOUND GUILTY. IT WAS NOT THE ACTORS JOB, IT IS ALL GOING TO COME DOWN TO THE INDUSTRIES TENDERED. WE HEARD ALL THINGS HERE. SOME SAY THE ACTOR IS NOT SUPPOSED TO CHECK THE GUN AND SOME SAY HE DOES. WE NEED TO FIND THE STANDARD AND WHAT BALDWIN DID OR DID NOT DO, THAT WILL HINGE ON WHETHER. HE IS NEGLIGENT >>. IT IS SAFE TO ASSUME THAT BALDWIN SEEMED WAS WATCHING THIS CLOSELY. HOW MUCH OF WHAT WE HEARD IS GOING TO CARRY OVER >>. QUITE A BIT IS SPECIALLY DAVE. ALL WE SAW HIS EMOTIONAL TESTIMONY. THE WITNESSES WILL BE THE SAME. THE COCAINE IS RELEVANT AND WILL NOT APPLY IN THIS CASE. THERE IS EVIDENCE TAMPERING ABOUT HAVING PASSED OVER COCAINE BAGGY. THIS WAS NOT SOMETHING. SHE WAS FOUND GUILTY OF. THEY ARE TRYING TO PROVE THAT SHE WAS USING COCAINE AND RECREATIONALLY USING DRUGS ON THE SET TO CREATE THE PATTERN OF NEGLIGENCE FOR BALDWIN. THERE, LIKELY, WILL NOT BE THE ALLEGATIONS OF RECREATIONAL DRUG USE. IN THAT REGARD. THE EVIDENCE WILL BE LESS AGAINST THEM. >> IS A GOOD NEWS FOR ALEC. >>. IT PUTS RESPONSIBILITY ON THE SHOULDER OF OTHER PEOPLE AND THEN HE CAN SAY THESE OTHER PEOPLE WERE RESPONSIBLE. THE PROSECUTOR EVEN SAID THEY WERE RESPONSIBLE. IT WAS THEIR JOB AND NOT MY JOB. >>. THANK YOU. >>>. FERTILITY CLINICS IN ALABAMA HAVE NEW PREDICTIONS. THANKS TO A NEW BILL SIGNED INTO LAW. SOME CLINICS WILL RESUME TREATMENTS AS SOON AS THIS WEEK.

THE SPOKESPERSON FOR THE GOVERNOR CONFIRMED THAT THE PRIME MINISTER OF HAITI LANDED ON THE ISLAND ON TUESDAY AND IS UNABLE TO RETURN TO HIS COUNTRY. HE WAS LAST SEEN IN PUBLIC IN KENYA LAST FRIDAY. CRIMINAL GANGS SURROUNDED THE MAIN AIRPORT, MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO RETURN. THE FOREIGN MINISTRY SAID IN THE STATEMENT THAT THE US HAD ASKED THE DOMINICAN GOVERNMENT FOR PERMISSION FOR HIS AIRPLANE TO MAKE AN INDEFINITE LAYOVER, BUT THAT PERMISSION WAS DENIED. NOW LET'S GO TO LITERATURE WITH NEWS THAT, 10 YEARS AFTER HIS DEATH, A NEW NOVEL PENNED WILL BE PUBLISHED AGAINST AS WELL. THE NOVEL WAS WRITTEN [ INAUDIBLE ] WHEN HE WAS STRUGGLING WITH DEMENTIA. HE TOLD HIS SONS TO RIP IT UP AND NEVER PUBLISH IT BECAUSE, HE SAID, THE NOVEL DID NOT WORK AND MADE NO SENSE. A DECADE LATER, HIS SONS DECIDED TO PUBLISH IT. THEY SAID IT WAS VERY MOVING. AND NOW LET'S GO TO ARCHAEOLOGY. NEW RESEARCH SAID THAT STONE TOOLS UNDER IN THE 70s WERE USE MORE THAN 1 MILLION YEARS AGO. INITIALLY THEY DID NOT BELIEVE THAT THE STONES WERE THAT OLD, AND ARCHAEOLOGIST SAID THEY USED A NEW DATING METHOD THAT BRINGS THESE TOOLS BACK $1 MILLION.

THERE WAS NO QUESTION THAT SOMETHING BAD HAD HAPPENED. THAT COMBINED WITH THE PLANE NOSEDIVING AND SEEING THE FLAMES >>. Reporter. IT'S A MID ERROR SCARE AND IT COMES DURING THE FALLOUT FROM THE ALASKA AIRLINES FLIGHT BLOWOUT BACK IN JANUARY FROM A DOOR FLYING OFF MOMENTS AFTER TAKE OFF.

BOEING SAID IT PROVIDED THE DETAILED INFORMATION INCLUDING A LIST OF INDIVIDUALS ON THE 737 DOOR TEAM IN THE STATEMENT ADDED. IF THIS HAD NOT BEEN DOCUMENTED, THEY WOULD HAVE NO DOCUMENTATION TO SHARE FOR AFTER LONG INSPECTION PROCESS. THE PLANE INVOLVED IS BACK IN THE AIR. >>. THE NTS BEACH CHAIR CONFIRMED THE INSPECTIONS HAVE NOT TURNED UP ANY MISSING BOLDS FROM THOSE PLANES IN SERVICE. AN AUDIT OF THE MANUFACTURING LINE FOUND FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH QUALITY CONTROL PROCEDURES. THE FAA GAVE THEM 90 DAYS TO ADDRESS THAT. BOEING SAYS IT WILL DO EXACTLY THAT. >>. THANK YOU SO MUCH. >>>. NEW RESEARCH FROM THE SLEEP FOUNDATION SAYS TEENS COULD BE STRUGGLING TO GET A GOOD NIGHT SLEEP. EIGHT OF 10 FEELS THEY DON'T GET ENOUGH SLEEP AT NIGHT >>. A LACK OF SLEEP COULD HAVE A BIG IMPACT ON MENTAL HEALTH. LET'S BRING IN THE VICE PRESIDENT OF RESEARCH AT THE NATIONAL SLEEP FOUNDATION. WALK US THROUGH THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY AND WHY DO TEENS NEED MORE SLEEP THAN ADULTS? >>. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. WE ASKED TEENS ABOUT THEIR SLEEP HABITS, WHAT TIME THEY GO TO SLEEP- ON SCHOOL NIGHTS AND WEEKENDS, THE THINGS OF THIS NATURE. NOW THEY FEEL WHAT WE SHOWED IS PRETTY STRIKING. THE MAJORITY OF TEENS DO NOT GET THE EIGHT TO 10 HOURS OF SLEEP PER NIGHT AND THAT IS STRONGLY LINKED WITH HOW THEY ARE FEELING DURING THE DAY. WE SHOW THAT ONE OF THREE TEENS HAS MILD OR GREATER DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS AND THREE OF FOUR TEENS REPORT THEIR EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING IS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED WHEN THEY SLEEP LESS THAN USUAL TEENS. THAT NEED THE SLEEP BECAUSE OF ALL THE DEMANDS THEY FACE AND THE NATURAL GROWTH THEY ARE EXPERIENCING AND DEVELOPMENTAL PROCESSES. WE NEED THIS SLEEP AT THIS POINT IN DEVELOPMENT >>. THERE IS SLEEP HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH. THAT IS CLOSELY LINKED FOR TEENS. HOW TO SLEEP, REGULATE EMOTIONS AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN TEENS HAVE TROUBLE SLEEPING. WHEN IT COMES TO THEIR MENTAL HEALTH. >>. IT IS LIKELY IT TWO-WAY ROAD. WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THAT POOR SLEEP CAN CERTAINLY LEAD TO EMOTIONAL DIFFICULTIES. THEY ARE ALSO KNOWN TO CARRY SLEEP AS A SYMPTOM. WHEN WE DIG A LITTLE DEEPER, WE HAVE ALL AREAS FOR NIGHTS OF SLEEP AND YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING AND YOU ARE LIKELY TO INTERPRET THE WORLD AROUND YOU IN A NEGATIVE WAY AND FOCUS ON THOSE UNWANTED OCCURRENCES. WHEN YOU SLEEP WELL AND WAKE UP FEELING ENERGIZED AND REFRESHED, YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO TACKLE THE WORLD AROUND YOU AND INTERPRET THINGS IN A MORE POSITIVE LIGHT AND NOT FOCUS ON NEGATIVE EVENTS. WE PROCESS EMOTIONS AND MEMORY CONSOLIDATION DURING SLEEP. WE ARE MORE LIKELY TO GET OUT AND GET ACTIVE WHEN WE SLEEP. THESE ARE RELATED TO MENTAL WELL-BEING. >>. THIS WEEKEND, WE LOSE AN HOUR OF SLEEP. WHAT IS THE IMPACT OF THIS TIME CHANGE? DO WE NEED TO STOP DOING THIS? >> YES, WE HAVE ADOPTED A POSITION THAT WE SHOULD STOP LOCK CHANGES AND STICK TO PERMANENT STANDARD TIME. THE REASON IS PRETTY CLEAR: FIRST, WHEN WE MOVED TO DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME, WE LOSE AN HOUR OF SLEEP FOLLOWING THAT CLOCK CHANGE. THERE IS A CHRONIC MISALIGNMENT BETWEEN THE OUTSIDE WORLD AND OUR INTERNAL BODY CLOCKS. WE SLEEP BEST WHEN WE HAVE EXPOSURE TO NICE. BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE MORNING AND IN THE EVENING IT IS DARK AND DIM. DURING DAYLIGHT- SAVING TIME- WE GET DARKNESS WELL INTO THE MORNING HOURS AND THEN BRIGHT LATE IN THE EVENING, FOR THIS RESULTS IN POOR SLEEP. WE KNOW THERE IS AN INCREASED RISK OF CAR CRASHES, ACCIDENTS, A WHOLE HOST OF PHYSICAL AILMENTS. THE BULK OF THAT DATA LED TO THE SLEEP FOUNDATION TO ADOPT A POSITION. THE PERMANENT STANDARD TIME IS THE CORRECT CHOICE. >> THANK YOU. >> THANK YOU. HAVE A GOOD ONE >>> OF BEAUTY CATCHING THE EYE OF'S BRING BREAKERS. IT'S GOT A BLUE DRAGON >>>.

KNOW THAT IF THEY DON'T RECOGNIZE SOMETHING, ESPECIALLY IF IT'S BLUE TO TALK TO AN ADULT BEFORE THEY TOUCH ANYTHING AND KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON PATS, LIKE YOU HEARD, YOU CAN TAKE PICTURES AND YOU CAN ADMIRE THEM, BUT RESIST THE URGE TO TOUCH THEM >>>.

THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO DO. >> IV, IT WAS A JACKET. >>. OKAY, I THINK I HAVE BEEN. --. I THINK THE FIRST EDDIE MURPHY MOVIE I SAW WAS MULAN ON 35, SO IT WAS ROTATED HEAVY IN MY HOUSE AND THEN I CIRCLED BACK AND WATCHED EVERYTHING ELSE.

RUST MOVIE ARMORER HANNAH GUTIERREZ-REED FOUND GUILTY OF INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER FOR HER ROLE IN THE DEADLY SHOOTING THAT KILLED. CINEMATOGRAPHER HALYNA HUTCHINS, AT THE DREAM ACT, DECIDED SHE WAS NOT GUILTY OF EVIDENCE. TAMPERING THAT VERDICT CAME DOWN QUICK HOURS AFTER CLOSING ARGUMENTS WHERE PROSECUTORS DID NOT MINCE WORDS. THEY CALLED GUTIERREZ REED, CARELESS AND THOUGHTLESS AND FAILED TO PREVENT LIVE AMMO FROM APPEARING ON THAT SET >>. I'M NOT TELLING YOU. HANNAH GUTIERREZ INTENDED TO BRING LIVE ROUNDS ONSET. I'M TELLING YOU, SHE WAS NEGLIGENT, SHE WAS CARELESS, SHE WAS THOUGHTLESS AT. THIS WAS A GAME OF RUSSIAN ROULETTE. EVERY TIME AN ACTOR HAD A GUN. >> IS ELECTED JURY AGREED: DANA GRIFFIN JOINS US FROM SANTA FE, NEW MEXICO. THE DELIBERATION DID NOT TAKE LONG >>. Reporter. AFTER 2 1/2 WEEKS OF TESTIMONY AND 2 1/2 HOURS OF DELIBERATION, THEY CAME TO THAT DECISION. I ASKED ONE OF THE JURORS OUTSIDE OF COURT. WHAT WAS THE KEY PIECE OF EVIDENCE THAT BROUGHT THEM TO THEIR DECISION. LISTEN TO WHAT HE TOLD ME: >> YOU HAVE LIVE ROUNDS AND YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW IT. NOT CHECKING THEM. THAT IS A PROBLEM. PARTNER WAS EVERYONE, UNANIMOUS. DID ANYONE PUSH BACK? >> NOT REALLY LITTLE DIFFERENCES: 2%. WHY, NOT GUILTY ON COCAINE? >> WE DID OT THINK IT WAS NECESSARY? >> Reporter: NOT ENOUGH --. >> NOTHING THERE. WHO KNOWS COULD HAVE BEEN ANYTHING? >>. Reporter. THERE WAS NOTHING THERE FOR THE EVIDENCE TAMPERING CHARGE, BECAUSE SHE WAS CONVICTED ON ONE OF THE CHARGES SHE FACES UP TO 18 MONTHS IN PRISON. >>. WHAT A FASCINATING POST TRIAL INTERVIEW. WHAT WAS THE VIBE IN COURT WHEN THE VERDICT WAS BEING READ? >> Reporter. ALL WAS QUIET WHEN YOU STARTED TO HEAR THE AUDIBLE GASPS FROM HER MOTHER. IT HAPPENED WHEN THE JUDGE DECIDED TO REMAND HANNAH TO PRESENT. THAT IS SOMETHING PEOPLE DID NOT EXPECT, BECAUSE SHE HAS BEEN OUT SINCE THE SHOOTING. SHE HAS NOT GONE TO JAIL. WE HAVE BEEN INTERACTING WITH HER. SO THERE WAS A MOMENT WHEN SHE HAD TO STAND UP. THE OFFICERS ESCORTED HER OUT. HER MOTHER WAS SOBBING. HANNAH TURNED AROUND AND SAID: BYE YOU, GUYS, GUYS. HER MOTHER SAID: LOVE YOU, HONEY. HANNAH BLEW A KISS TO HER MOTHER. HER MOTHER WAS FURIOUS. SHE GOT A THING EXPLETIVES NOT HAPPY ABOUT THIS. OUTSIDE OF COURT. THE DEFENSE DOES NOT BELIEVE THERE IS ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO CONVICT HER AND THE STATE PLANS TO APPEAL. >>. ALEC BALDWIN'S TRIAL IS A COUPLE MONTHS AWAY. HOW MANY ARGUMENTS THAT WE THOUGHT IN THIS TRIAL WILL REAPPEAR IN THE BALDWIN TRIAL. >>. Reporter. BALDWIN'S NAME CAME UP CONSTANTLY THROUGHOUT THE TRIAL. A LOT OF ARGUMENTS WE HEARD FROM HIM RUSHING ACTORS, HIM NOT BEING SAFE WITH THAT ACTORS, THOSE WITH IN HIS TRIAL, IF IT GOES AS PLANNED, IN JULY EVEN DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS, HIS NAME WAS BROUGHT UP BY THE PROSECUTOR. I WANT TO READ WHAT SHE SAID. SHE SAID BALDWIN'S CONDUCT IN THAT CHURCH ON THAT DAY IS SOMETHING HE WILL HAVE TO ANSWER FOR. NOT WITH YOU TODAY, THAT WILL BE WITH ANOTHER JURY ON ANOTHER DAY. WE HEARD A LOT OF EVIDENCE PRESENTED TODAY EVEN THAT THE DEFENSE BROUGHT UP. THEY SAY HE PULLED THE TRIGGER AND THE SCRIPT DID NOT CALL FOR HIM TO FULLY PULL HIS WEAPON OUT OF HIS HOLSTER. SO THAT WILL BE KEY WHEN HE GOES TO TRIAL AND SOME OF THE MISTAKES HE ALLEGEDLY MADE. >>. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COVERAGE ON THIS CASE. >>>. TURNING TO THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE AND WHAT MAY COME AS A SHOCK TO NO ONE, TODAY WE SAW IT: NIKKI HALEY OFFICIALLY DROP OUT OF THE RACE AFTER LOSING ALL BUT ONE STATE TO DONALD TRUMP ON SUPER TUESDAY. FOR THOSE WATCHING CLOSELY, THE QUESTION WASN'T IF SHE WOULD END HER CAMPAIGN, BUT WHAT SHE WOULD DO AFTER. SHE CALLED IT QUITS. WHAT HAPPENS TO THE MONEY SHE RAISED? IS SHE REALLY NOT GOING TO BE TRUMP VP. WHAT IS IT MEAN FOR HALEY SUPPORTERS TURNED OFF BY TRUMP MAGA >>. IT IS UP TO DONALD TRUMP TO EARN THE VOTE OF THOSE IN OUR PARTY AND BEYOND THAT, WHO DID NOT SUPPORT HIM? I HOPE HE DOES. THAT AT ITS BEST, POLITICS IS ABOUT BRINGING PEOPLE AND YOUR CAUSE, NOT TURNING THEM AWAY. OUR CONSERVATIVE PARTY NEEDS MORE PEOPLE. >>. MEANWHILE, A LOT OF DEMOCRATS SAW SUPER TUESDAY AS A BLOWOUT FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN. HE IS HALFWAY TOWARDS OFFICIALLY CLINCHING THE NOMINATION, AND TOMORROW HE WILL BE GIVING STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS. DONALD TRUMP ANNOUNCEMENT: TRUTH SOCIAL. HE WILL BE DOING LIVE PLAY-BY-PLAY, TO QUOTE CORRECT ANY AND ALL INACCURATE STATEMENTS MADE BY THE PRESIDENT, SAYING HE IS READY TO GO HEAD-TO-HEAD WITH BIDEN IN A DEBATE, ANYTIME, ANYWHERE, ANYPLACE. FOR MORE, LET'S BRING CORRESPONDENT VAUGHN HILLYARD WITH HALEY OUT OF THE RACE. I HAVE TO ASK: WHY ARE WE GOING TO HOLD PRIMARIES? >>. NUMBER ONE VOTERS. EVEN IF THERE IS NO OTHER OPTION, THEY GET THAT OPPORTUNITY. THE OTHER PART OF THIS IS THE CONVENTION FOR REPUBLICANS IS NOT UNTIL THE MIDDLE OF JULY. GOD BLESS THE FORMER PRESIDENT. IT MAY GO ALL RIGHT. HEALTHWISE FOR HIM. BUT THERE IS A PROCESS THAT CONTINUES. NIKKI HALEY AND OTHERS WILL BE ON THE BALLOTS. AT THOSE PLACES, DELEGATES WILL BE PORTIONED OUT. IN THIS SCENARIO, ANYTHING WERE TO HAPPEN. EACH OF THE STATES AHEAD WILL GET THEIR DELEGATES OUT TO SOMEBODY. SO EACH OF THESE DIFFERENT CANDIDATES, INCLUDING DONALD TRUMP, WILL GO TO THE CONVENTION WITH A CERTAIN NUMBER OF DELEGATES, NIKKI HALEY INCLUDED. IN CASE. ANYTHING HAPPENED. THAT IS WHY THE PROCESS CONTINUES IS WHY THE PROCESS CONTINUES. >> BACKUP PLAN CONVENTIONS. LET'S LISTEN TO WHAT SOME HALEY SUPPORTERS HAD TO SAY AFTER SHE SUSPENDED HER CAMPAIGN TODAY. >> I'M DISAPPOINTED. SHE IS OUT. IT DOES NOT GIVE US VERY GOOD OPTIONS AT THIS POINT. SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN THE PERSON I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE VOTED FOR IF SHE WAS STILL RUNNING. >> DISAPPOINTED, I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO SEE SOMEBODY ELSE MAKE THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY BE A PARTY AGAIN, BECAUSE IT IS IN UTTER CHAOS AND THE LEADERS DON'T HAVE A CLUE WHAT THEY ARE DOING >>. THE BIG QUESTION IS: WHAT DOES DONALD TRUMP HAVE TO DO TO WIN OVER THOSE KIND OF VOTERS, OR, POSSIBLY, PRESIDENT BIDEN? >>. Reporter RIGHT NIKKI HALEY SET ON THE STAGE. IT IS UP TO DONALD TRUMP TO WIN OVER, NOT ONLY HER PERSONALLY BUT THOSE VOTERS. THAT CONVENTION I MENTIONED IN JULY IN MILWAUKEE. THAT IS WHEN REPUBLICANS AND DELEGATES THAT WOULD FORMALLY NOMINATE DONALD TRUMP TO BE THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT. WILL GATHER YOU USUALLY SEE THE PROMINENT REPUBLICAN ELECTED OFFICIALS AND USUALLY WITH THE, THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE'S FORMER RIVALS, THE LIKES OF TIM SCOTT AND RON DESANTIS. WILL NIKKI HALEY SHOW UP AND TRY TO HELP? MAKE THE CASE THAT REPUBLICANS, AS DONALD TRUMP SAYS SHE SHOULD, SHOULD UNITE AROUND HIM TO ADVANCE THE MORE CONSERVATIVE AGENDA COME 2025?? THAT IS THE OUTSTANDING QUESTION. YOU'RE LOOKING THAT PART OF ELECTORATE THAT ARGUABLY WON JOE BIDEN THE WHITE HOUSE IN 2020, AFTER THEY FLED DONALD TRUMP FROM 2016.. CAN DONALD TRUMP WIN A SHARE OF THOSE VOTERS THAT HIS CAMPAIGN MADE? THE CASE IN BIDEN/TRUMP REMATCH? MOST OF THOSE VOTERS THEY BELIEVE WILL COME BACK TO THEM, EVEN WITHOUT NIKKI HALEY. GO, SUPPORT DONALD TRUMP THE NEXT EIGHT MONTHS OF THE GENERAL ELECTION. >>. I KNOW THAT ARIZONA IS NEAR AND DEAR TO YOUR HEART. I WAS SURPRISED BY ARIZONA'S DEMOCRAT TURNED INDEPENDENT KYRSTEN SINEMA IN THE NEWS. SHE WILL NOT SEEK RE-ELECTION. LISTEN TO WHAT SHE SAID. >>. IN THE CRITICAL VICTORY THAT MATTERS, THESE DAYS ARE SYMBOLIC, ATTACKING YOUR OPPONENT ON CABLE NEWS OR SOCIAL MEDIA. COMPROMISE IS A FOREIGN WORD. WE HAVE CORRECTED THAT PROCESS AND CHOSEN ANGER. I BELIEVE IN MY APPROACH BUT IT IS NOT WHAT AMERICA WANTS. RIGHT NOW, BECAUSE I CHOOSE CIVILITY, UNDERSTANDING, LISTENING, WORKING TOGETHER TO GET STUFF DONE. I BELIEVE THE SENATE I WILL BE LEAVING AT THE END OF THIS YEAR >>. SHE IS NOT WRONG. HOW IS THE RACE LOOKING TO REPLACE HER POTENTIAL PICKUP FOR REPUBLICANS? LOOKING TO TAKE BACK CONTROL OF THE SENATE, ESPECIALLY IN A PLACE LIKE ARIZONA? >>. Reporter. THIS WAS A THREE- PERSON RACE WHEN SHE BECAME INDEPENDENT DEMOCRAT: RUBEN GALLEGO, WHO ANNOUNCED HIS OWN SENATE BID, AND KARI LAKE, THE REPUBLICAN. SHE LOST NARROWLY FOR GOVERNOR IN 2022, CLOSE ALLY OF DONALD TRUMP AND RUNNING FOR THE US SENATE AGAIN AND, LIKELY, THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE. YOU HAVE TWO-PERSON MATCHUP TO FILL KYRSTEN SINEMA'S SHOES. KYRSTEN SINEMA ONLY GARNERED 15 OR 25% IN THE POLLS. IT WAS CLEAR TO HER THAT AMERICANS AND ARIZONANS DON'T WANT SOMEBODY LIKE HER RIGHT. NOW THE QUESTION IS: WITH THAT HEAD-TO- HEAD MATCHUP, THE LONGTIME CONSERVATIVE STATE OF ARIZONA COULD THE DEMOCRATS HOLD ONTO THE SENATE SEAT. THAT IS WHAT RUBEN GALLEGO IS LOOKING TO DO. IT IS ALSO JOE BIDEN THAT WANT THE STATE IN 2020 BY 11,000 VOTES. SO THIS WILL BE FRONT AND CENTER STATE IN 2024 FOR THE REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS, NOT ONLY FOR THE SENATE RACE BUT ALSO THE WHITE HOUSE >>>. THE SUPREME COURT SET A DATE TO DECIDE WHETHER DONALD TRUMP IS ACTUALLY IMMUNE FROM CRIMINAL PROSECUTION ON THE CHARGES OF ELECTION INTERFERENCE. THAT DATE IS APRIL 25th, THE LAST DAY OF THE COURT CALENDAR, WHICH IS ONE MONTH AFTER TRUMP GOES TO TRIAL IN NEW YORK ON THE HUSH MONEY CRIMINAL CASE. IT WILL BE A BUSY STRETCH FOR TRUMP AFTER THAT, WITH TWO OTHER FEDERAL TRIALS IN GEORGIA AND FLORIDA BEFORE ELECTION DAY. LET'S BRING LEGAL ANALYST ANGELA CENEDELLA. APRIL 25th IS MORE THAN SEVEN WEEKS AWAY. IT IS THE LAST DAY OF THE DOCKET. ARE YOU SURPRISED? THE JUSTICES ARE WAITING THAT LONG. IS IT ON PURPOSE? >>. I HAVE TO SAY I'M NOT SURPRISED AND I UNDERSTAND TO LAYPEOPLE. IT SEEMS LIKE THEY ARE NOT MOVING FAST ENOUGH. I HAVE TO TELL YOU THE SUPREME COURT IS EXTREMELY BUSY. THEY SEE 100 TO 150 CASES PER TERM. THE APRIL ALENDAR IS VERY FULL FOR THE SUPREME COURT SQUEEZING THEM IN. ON APRIL 25th- HICH IS A THURSDAY, AND I DON'T USUALLY HAVE THURSDAY SESSIONS. IT IS MOVING QUICKLY FOR THEM. I DON'T SEE THIS AS A POLITICAL DECISION. THEY ARE TRYING TO SQUEEZE IN WHAT THEY BELIEVE IS A MOMENTOUS CASE IN THE MIDST OF A BUSY SEASON. >>. YOU THINK THIS CASE, OR OTHER CASES, WILL BE DECIDED BEFORE ELECTION DAY. WHAT YOU THINK? >>. I DO THINK THIS CASE WILL BE, AND LESS SO BECAUSE OF SCOTUS BUT MORE SO BECAUSE OF THE JUDGE CHUTKAN WAS OVERSEEING THE DC CASE. LET'S GO OVER THE TIMELINE. IT APPEARS, APRIL WILL BE WHEN ARGUMENTS WILL BE HEARD AND IT IS LIKELY BY THE END OF JUNE, IF NOT EARLIER. THEY COULD GIVE A DECISION EARLIER IN MAY, WHENEVER THEY WANT, THEY WILL HAVE SOME SORT OF A DECISION AND IT IS MY FIRM BELIEF- THE DECISION WILL NOT BE TRUMP, WILL HAVE TOTAL IMMUNITY AND THIS CASE WILL DISAPPEAR. I BELIEVE THE CASE WILL BE REMANDED BACK TO THE DISTRICT COURT AND THE TRIAL WILL THEN BEGIN. AT THAT POINT, A COUPLE MONTHS REQUIRED FOR PRETRIAL MOTIONS AND JUDGE CHUTKAN CAN START HER TRIAL FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. SHE HAS BEEN INTENT ON MAKING SURE THIS TRIAL WILL HAPPEN PRIOR TO THE ELECTION. SHE HAS BROAD DISCRETION AND I BELIEVE SHE WILL ALMOST FORCE IT. IF IT IS REMANDED. THAT MEANS WE ARE ABOUT AUGUST SEPTEMBER AND BY THAT POINT A TRIAL COULD HAPPEN. >>. I WAS TRAINED TO DO THE MATH WITH A COUPLE MONTHS FOR PRETRIAL MOTIONS. AUGUST SEPTEMBER, POSSIBLY OCTOBER. THAT IS A CRUNCHY TIMELINE >> VERY CLOSE TO THE ELECTION. BUT THAT IS WHAT WE ARE SAYING. >>>. TURNING TO GEORGIA AND THE EFFORT TO GET A FULTON COUNTY DA FANI WILLIS BOOTED FROM HER ELECTION INTERFERENCE CASE AGAINST DONALD TRUMP. TODAY REPUBLICAN-LED SENATE PANEL GAVE THE FLOOR TO ONE OF TRUMP'S LAWYERS WHO CONTINUES TO ACCUSE WILLIS OF HAVING AN IMPROPER RELATIONSHIP WITH HER SPECIAL PROSECUTOR. CORRESPONDENT BLAYNE ALEXANDER HAS MORE >>. Reporter WERE WATCHING. ARE THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST FULTON COUNTY DA FANI WILLIS THAT WE COVER? THE LAST TWO MONTHS FULTON COUNTY, GEORGIA, STATE HOUSE HAPPEN IN A COMMITTEE MEETING EARLIER TODAY. TO BE CLEAR, THIS IS A REPUBLICAN-LED STATE SENATE COMMITTEE. THEY HAVE VERY LITTLE POWER IF THEY FIND WRONGDOING ON THE PART OF WILLIS PICNIC AND REFER TO ANOTHER BODY OR RECOMMEND NEW LOSS TO CURB SOMETHING LIKE THIS IN THE FUTURE. THAT AS A PRACTICAL MATTER BUT POLITICALLY IT IS A DIFFERENT STORY. REPUBLICANS BELIEVE THEY HAVE A DUTY TO INVESTIGATE ANY ALLEGED IMPROPRIETY. THEY EXPECTED TO LAST MANY MONTHS LIKELY SUBPOENA WILLIS IN THE MONTHS TO COME. THING HE WANTS TO HEAR FROM HER AND IF SHE DOES NOT COME VOLUNTARILY, A SUBPOENA IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD EXPLORE. DEMOCRATS SAY IT IS NOTHING BUT POLITICALLY MOTIVATED ACTION. ONE COMMITTEE MEMBER TOLD ME IT TAKES AWAY THE FOCUS OFF OF DONALD TRUMP AND PUT THAT ON FANI WILLIS. WE HEARD FROM FANI WILLIS HERSELF THE STATE CAPITOL WAS VERY BUSY. TODAY FANI WILLIS QUALIFIED TO RUN FOR RE-ELECTION AND WE ASKED HER ABOUT THE COMMITTEE MEETING THAT HAPPENED EARLIER TODAY. >>. I THINK IT IS A POLITICAL QUEST. PEOPLE ARE IN GREAT BECAUSE I WILL DO THE RIGHT THING AND STAND UP FOR JUSTICE. NO MATTER WHO IS THE PERSON THAT MAY HAVE DONE WRONG IN FULTON COUNTY. THEY CAN CONTINUE WITH THE GAMES AND I WILL CONTINUE TO DO THE WORK OF THE PEOPLE. >>. Reporter. WHAT WE ARE WATCHING CLOSELY IS WHAT IS HAPPENING. A COUPLE BLOCKS AWAY AT THE FULTON COUNTY COURTHOUSE. JUDGE SCOTT McAFEE WILL DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT FANI WILLIS CAN REMAIN ON THE CASE AND KEEP PROSECUTING THE CASE IN LIGHT OF THE MOTION TO DISMISS AND HAVE HER DISQUALIFIED.

THAT IS WHAT OFFICIALS DO NOT WANT PEOPLE TO DO, BECAUSE THOSE CANISTERS COULD STILL EXPLODE. THERE WERE MINOR EXPLOSIONS TODAY, WHICH RE-EMERGE OR LED TO A SMALL FIRE. WE SAW FIREFIGHTERS HERE EARLIER IN THE DAY, POURING WATER ON THE AREA, TRYING TO PUT OUT THE HOTSPOTS, THOSE CANISTERS. WHEN THEY EXPLODE AND BREAK, THEY ARE DANGEROUS, VERY SHARP METAL.

THE AFFIDAVIT LAYS OUT: THE GIRLS GOT TOGETHER FOR VOMIT SLEEP OVERNIGHT, DO FACEMASKS AND WATCH A MOVIE, AND THE FATHER MADE THEM SMOOTHIES. HE WAS VERY PARTICULAR ABOUT WHICH GIRL GOT EACH SMOOTHIE. HE WANTED EACH TO HAVE TWO SERVINGS. EACH GIRL HAD SPECIFIC COLOR-CODED REUSABLE STRAWS AND HE GOT UPSET WHEN THEY TRIED TO SWITCH THE SMOOTHIES. IT WAS VERY CONFUSING IN THAT SENSE AND VERY INTENTIONAL. ONE OF THE GIRLS NOTICED THINGS WERE OFF AND DID NOT WANT TO DRINK AS MUCH OF THE SMOOTHIE. THE OTHER THREE GIRLS DEAD THOUGH IN THE DID NOT AS MUCH NOTICE. THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT THE FATHER WAS HOVERING IN THE BASEMENT AS THE GIRLS WERE FALLING ASLEEP, HE WAS WANDERING AROUND WHILE THEY WERE SLEEPING.

Reporter. TODAY FOR THE FIRST TIME ATTACKED BY THE IRANIAN-BACKED HOUTHI REBELS IN HUMAN PROVED FATAL. TODAY THE HOUTHI REBELS FIRED ANTISHIP BALLISTIC MISSILE AT A CARGO SHIP IN THE GULF OF ADEN. IT STRUCK THAT SHIP, KILLING THREE OF THE CIVILIAN MARINERS ON BOARD, AND WE ARE LEARNING LATE. TONIGHT FOUR OTHERS WERE INJURED, INCLUDING THREE CRITICAL. THAT ANTISHIP BALLISTIC MISSILE STRUCK THE SHIP AFTER. THEY HAD SOME COMMUNICATION BACK AND FORTH WITH THE HOUTHIS WHO TOLD THEM TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE AREA. THE SHIP ISSUED DISTRESS CALL AND A NUMBER OF COALITION WARSHIPS, MOVED INTO THE AREA. AT THAT POINT THE CREW ABANDONED THE VESSEL THAT SUFFERED SEVERE STRUCTURAL DAMAGE AND WAS ON FIRE.

THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS CRITICAL AT THIS MOMENT, JUST AS WESTERN COUNTRIES, ESPECIALLY THE UNITED STATES, ARE RETHINKING AID TO UKRAINE AND WONDERING WHETHER. THE HIGH COST OF PROVIDING MILITARY AID TO UKRAINE IS WORTH IT CONSIDERING. NOW, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE COUNTRY, UKRAINE IS LOSING A LOT OF GROUND. AFTER TWO YEARS OF RUSSIA'S RELENTLESS ASSAULT, UKRAINIANS PUT UP QUITE A FIGHT BUT ARE RUNNING OUT OF AMMUNITION, AND ALL OF THIS IS CRITICAL. THEY'RE TRYING TO HOLD THE LINE, AS THE RUSSIANS APPEAR TO NOT BE AS DEPLETED AS THEY WERE IN THE RECENT PAST. THEY SEEM TO BE ABLE TO MOUNT SUSTAINED OFFENSIVE AND PUSHING UKRAINIANS TO THE WEST.

HE'S MAKING HISTORY, BUT NOT A LOT THAT A LOT OF LIBERALS WANTED TO SEE. WE HAVE THE DETAILS, INCLUDING THE RACE TO REPLACE THEM. THE NEW REACTION TONIGHT >>>.

WE ARE COMING ON THE AIR TONIGHT WITH THE LONGEST SERVING SENATE LEADER IN HISTORY STEPPING DOWN FROM THAT ROLE. HE'S MAKING CLEAR WHAT IS NOW THE ESSENTIAL TRUTH OF THE MODERATE REPUBLICAN PARTY. IT IS MAGA TERRITORY: THE NATIONAL CONCLUSION TO THE YEAR-LONG TRANSITION. THEY WERE ONCE UNDER McCONNELL'S THUMB AND THEY ARE UNDER CONTROL BY FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP. SENATOR McCONNELL ALLUDED TO THAT ON THE SENATE FLOOR TODAY, SUGGESTING THAT HE UNDERSTANDS THE POLITICAL DIRECTION. HE IS ALSO MAKING CLEAR THAT, EVEN THOUGH, HE WILL NOT BE THE SENATE GOP LEADER AFTER NOVEMBER. HE IS STICKING AROUND. HIS TERM ENDS IN THREE YEARS FROM NOW >>>. THERE HAVE BEEN SOME SPECULATION IT WILL HAPPEN, ESPECIALLY AFTER QUESTIONS AROUND THE 82-YEAR-OLD HEALTH. AFTER HE FROZE UP IN FRONT OF REPORTERS LAST YEAR. THERE HAVE BEEN QUESTIONS OVERALL ABOUT HIS GRIP ON THE PARTY, ESPECIALLY AFTER HE REFUSED TO GO ALONG WITH DONALD TRUMP'S ELECTION FRAUD LIES AND CRITICIZED HIS ROLE. HE HAD A YEAR OF INSULTS FROM FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP DIRECTED AT McCONNELL AND McCONNELL'S WIFE AND HIS AGE. THE LIST GOES ON. THE TRUMP FACTOR HAS ALWAYS BEEN IN PLACE SINCE. WHY STEP DOWN NOW? WHAT ARE SOME OF THE REACTION YOU ARE HEARING? >>. Reporter. THE TRUMP FACTOR IS AN IMPORTANT REASON FOR WHY THIS IS HAPPENING. IT REACHED THE BOILING POINT FOR MITCH McCONNELL, STARTING WITH THE FACT THAT TRUMP IS, WITH THE FACT THAT TRUMP IS MARCHING FOR THE NOMINATION TRUMP. DOMINANCE OVER THE PARTY HAS GROWN SINCE HE WAS DEFEATED IN THE 2020 ELECTION. ONE OF THE FEW SEGMENTS OF THE PARTY THAT WAS NOT KEPT DEFIED. IT HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE IN THE MOLD OF DONALD TRUMP- THE MOLD OF DONALD TRUMP. McCONNELL KNOWS HOW TO READ THE POLITICAL MOMENT. HE INDICATED TODAY THAT HE IS READING THIS ONE AND DECIDING TO STEP ASIDE. THERE ALSO IS THE HEALTH FACTOR, A CASCADING SERIES OF EVENT. IT GOES ALL THE WAY BACK TO 2003.. HE UNDERWENT TRIPLE HEART I PASS SURGERY. 2019, HE FRACTURED HIS SHOULDER, AFTER FALLING THOSE. TWO INCIDENTS LED TO A FULL RECOVERY. NO REAL CONCERN BUT IN MARCH OF 2023, HE HAD A CONCUSSION AND BROKEN RIBS. IN JUNE, HE FROZE UP AT A PRESS CONFERENCE, AND AGAIN IN JULY. THE HEALTH FACTOR SEEMS TO BE ON HIS MIND WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT FATHER TIME BEING UNDEFEATED. THAT WAS ONE FACTOR. HE SAYS THAT IT IS NOT OVER FOR HIM. HE IS NOT QUITE LEAVING THE STAGE, YET. LET'S LISTEN TO WHAT HE HAD TO SAY. >>. I STILL HAVE ENOUGH GAS IN MY THANK, SORRY, TO DISAPPOINT MY CRITICS. I INTEND TO DO SO WITH ALL OF THE ENTHUSIASM WITH WHICH THEY- THE ENTHUSIASM WITH WHICH THEY- HAVE BECOME ACCUSTOMED. >>>. BREAKING NEWS- NOW. LET ME STAY WITH YOU HERE -- OBVIOUSLY SIGNIFICANT, AS IT RELATES TO WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH SENATOR MITCH McCONNELL. WHO ARE THE CANDIDATES TO REPLACE THEM NOW? PRESUMABLY, THE TEAM IS SURROUNDING HIM IN LEADERSHIP NOW. >>. HE WILL FINISH OUT HIS TERM AS LEADER IT EXPIRES THE END OF THE YEAR, HE WILL STICK AROUND UNTIL THE. HE WILL STICK AROUND UNTIL THE END OF 2027.. IN THE NOVEMBER ELECTION, THERE ARE ALREADY A FEW CANDIDATES ON THE MINDS OF PEOPLE IN TERMS OF POTENTIAL REPLACEMENTS FOR A POTENTIAL THE THREE JOHN'S. THESE ARE ALL CURRENT OR FORMER DEPUTIES AND THEY ARE SEEN AS FRONT RUNNERS. THEY ARE THE THREE MOST LIKELY NAMES. ONE OF THEM WILL MOST LIKELY BE McCONNELL'S EFFECTOR. THESE LEADERSHIP BATTLES ARE USUALLY --. >>>. WE WILL BREAK IN FOR AN NBC NEWS SPECIAL REPORT. WE WILL LISTEN HERE AT LESTER HOLT AND DEVELOPMENTS FOR THE SUPREME COURT. SUPREME COURT >>>. NBC NEWS SPECIAL REPORT. HERE IS LESTER HOLT. >>>. WE'RE COMING ON THE AIR WITH BREAKING NEWS FROM THE SUPREME COURT ABOUT FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP. THE COURT JUST SAID THAT THEY ARE TAKING UP MR TRUMP'S REQUEST TO HEAR WHETHER OR NOT. HE IS IMMUNE FROM PROSECUTION. THIS WILL TEMPORARILY STOP THE FEDERAL ELECTION INTERFERENCE CASE AGAINST HIM FROM GOING TO TRIAL. IT COMES AFTER AN APPEALS COURT IN WASHINGTON REJECTING MR TRUMP'S CLAIM OF IMMUNITY FROM CRIMINAL CHARGES FOR HIS ACTIONS LEADING UP TO THE JANUARY 6th ATTACK ON THE CAPITOL. CORRESPONDENT LAURA JARRETT IS WITH ME. WALK THIS THROUGH WITH ME. >>. LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW WE GOT HERE. HE WENT TO THE SUPREME COURT TO. HE WENT TO THE SUPREME COURT TO ASK FOR A PAUSE. IT COULD BE COMPLETELY POSITIVE. HE DID NOT WANT THE DC CIRCUIT DECISION TO GO INTO EFFECT, THAT SAYS HE'S NOT IMMUNE FROM PROSECUTION INSTEAD. THE COURT DID EXACTLY WHAT THE FORMER PRESIDENT WANTED. THEY DECIDED TO GRAB THE ISSUE FOR THEMSELVES AND THEY WILL HEAR THE CASE ON AN EXPEDITED CASE. THEY WILL HEAR IT ON APRIL 22nd DOES NOT PARTICULARLY FAST BUT TO THE SUPREME COURT, THAT IS FAST. HERE'S WHAT THEY WANTED. HE WANTED THE HIGH COURT TO RULE, TO GIVE A DEFINITIVE ANSWER. SO WE WOULD NOT HAVE A SITUATION TO GO ALL THE WAY TO A TRIAL AND ONE COURT WILL SAY HE'S IMMUNE AND ONE WILL SAY HE IS NOT. WE WANT THE COURT TO GO ON IT RIGHT AWAY. IT'S AN ISSUE THAT COULD MAKE OR BREAK THE CASE. >>. WILL THEY MAKE A DECISION WITHIN A FINITE PERIOD OF TIME >>. NO, I WOULD IMAGINE THEY WILL EXPEDITE IT AND RULE QUICKLY, BUT THEY ARE NOT UNDER A TIMEFRAME. THEY CAN TAKE AS LONG AS THEY WANT. FOR MR TRUMP, THIS IS A WOOD BECAUSE IT SLOWS THINGS DOWN. IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IN MARCH. THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE A POSSIBILITY. THE SPECIAL COUNSEL NEEDS THIS. THE SPECIAL COUNSEL DEPENDS ON THIS. I THINK IT MIGHT BE WHY THE I THINK IT MIGHT BE WHY THE SUPREME COURT IS TAKING UP IN FLORIDA AND NEW YORK AND THEY CAN KEEP COMING UP IF THE SUPREME COURT DOES NOT RESOLVE ITUE IN A VARIETY OF, HE COULD KEEP RAISING THIS ISSUE IN A VARIETY OF DIFFEREN CONTEXT. AND NOW WE WILL HAVE A FINAL ANSWER. >> GARRETT, WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THE FORMER PRESIDENT POLITICALLY AND AS HE FACES THESE MYRIAD OF CASES? >>. Reporter. I'M REFRESHING THE FORMER PRESIDENT SOCIAL MEDIA PAGE BECAUSE I EXPECT HE WILL GIVE IT AND I EXPECT THE CAMPAIGN WILL VIEW THIS AS A HUGE WIN. THE DELAY IT WILL CAUSE ON THE LEGAL AND POLITICAL FRONT, THE LONGER THEY CAN PUSH OUT ANY OF THESE TRIALS ON ANY OF THE CHARGES HE FACES, THE BETTER IT IS FOR HIM LEGALLY AND THE BETTER IT IS FOR HIM POLITICALLY. IN THE POLITICAL SENSE, DONALD TRUMP HAS THE IDEA THAT HE IS A TARGET OF THE DOJ, OR DEMOCRATIC PROSECUTORS IN BLUE STATES. THE CORE MESSAGE OF HIS 2024 CAMPAIGN THIS IS: HE IS SEEN AS FIGHTING BACK. HE WILL GET AN OPPORTUNITY. HIS LAWYERS WILL GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO ARGUE THE CASE IN FRONT OF THE SUPREME COURT. THE POLITICAL MESSAGING HE HAS TRIED TO PUT AROUND: THIS IT COULD ULTIMATELY RULE AGAINST HIM. THAT IS ANOTHER MATTER IN THE SHORT TERM. DONALD TRUMP AND HIS POLITICAL TEAM. THEY COME UP IN THE SHORT TERM. IT'S NOT HAVI. ONE CRISIS AFTER ANOTHER. THEY ARE TRYING TO KNOCK THEM DOWN AS THEY COME. IN FRONT OF HIM IS NOT ONLY ILLEGAL WOOD TO HAVE THIS HEARING TO DELAY THE TRIAL. IT'S A RHETORICAL AND A POLITICAL WIN FOR THE WAY HE LIKES TO TALK ABOUT ALL OF THE CASES THAT ARE PENDING AGAINST HIM. HIM >>. LAURA, AS WE LOOK AT THIS IT BUT DOES THIS APPLY TO THE CASE COMING FORWARD LATER IN? THERE IS A LEGAL TERM FOR DOES THIS APPLY TO THE CASES COMING FORWARD LATER IN MARCH? THE STATE CASE IN NEW YORK >>. IT MIGHT DEPEND ON EXACTLY HOW THE CONTOURS OF THE SUPREME COURT DECISION GETS THIS RESULT. THEY DEFINED THE QUESTION WHETHER, OR IF TO WHAT EXTENT. DOES THE FORMER PRESIDENT ENJOY IMMUNITY FROM CONDUCT ALLEGED TO INVOLVE AN OFFICIAL ACT DURING HIS TENURE IN OFFICE? HE'S ACCUSED OF HUSH MONEY IN NEW YORK AND FALSIFY THE BUSINESS RECORDS. THIS COULD POTENTIALLY COME INTO PLAY. THE FEDERAL CASE THAT WE TALK ABOUT, THE CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS- THAT HAS TO DO WITH ACTS THAT HAPPENED ONCE HE WAS NO LONGER IN THE WHITE HOUSE. AGAIN, HE HAS RAISED THE ISSUE OF THE MEANING WHILE HE WAS STILL PRESIDENT. THIS COULD HAVE MAJOR BEARINGS, NOT JUST IN THE DC CASE, BUT OTHER CASES AS WELL >>. LET ME TURN TO KRISTEN WELKER, AS THEY SAY, THE PLOT THICKENS >>. THAT IS RIGHT LOOK AT HOW THE COURT AND LEGAL TWISTS AND TURNS HAS BEEN FOR FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP. SO FAR, IT ONLY HAS HELPED HIM POLITICALLY, BECAUSE HE IS PAINTING HIMSELF AS THE VICTIM OF POLITICAL PERSECUTION. THAT IS TO ENERGIZE HIS BASE. FROM THE MOMENT THAT THE FIRST INDICTMENT CAME DOWN, HIS POLL NUMBERS HAVE ONLY GONE UP. WE HAVE SEEN THAT WITH EACH NEW INDICTMENT. WE HAVE SEEN THAT WITH EACH NEW COURT CASE. NOW THIS IS ANOTHER ARGUMENT. NOW HE HAS SOME WINS UNDER HIS BELT IN IOWA, NEW HAMPSHIRE, WHICH HAS ENERGIZED HIS SUPPORTERS. NOW HE HAS SOME WINS UNDER HIS BELT IN IOWA, NEW HAMPSHIRE, SOUTH CAROLINA, MICHIGAN. HE'S CONTINUING THE STUDY MARCH TO THE NOMINATION. AT THIS POINT, IT'S ALMOST INEVITABLE. IF THIS COURT CASE IS PUSHED IN THE DIRECTION THAT WE THINK IT WILL BE, IT COULD HAPPEN AFTER. FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS GOTTEN ALL OF THE DELEGATES THAT HE WOULD OFFICIALLY NEED TO BE DETERMINED TO BE THE NOMINEE. WE WILL HAVE TO SEE IF THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN. THE TIMING OF THIS IS SIGNIFICANT, BECAUSE YOU COULD HAVE A SCENARIO WHERE THIS COURT CASE BEGINS AFTER HE HAS BEEN DETERMINED TO BE THTHATE >> YOUGOP NOMINEE AND THE DECISION CAN COME DOWN AFTER THAT >>. YOU RAISE THE QUESTION IN OUR MINDS: THE TIMING, DO WE KNOW HOW THAT WOULD WORK IF THESE CASES COME TO TRIAL SOMEWHERE AFTE R WENOMINATION >>. ALL OF THIS IS UNCHARTED TERRITORY. WE HAVE NEVER SEEN A REPUBLICAN FRONT RENTER FACING THESE TRIALS. THERE IS NOTHING THAT STOPS THEM FROM RUNNING, FROM THEM FROM RUNNING FROM FINDS THAT HE'S IMMUNE AND CANNOT B HE HAS NOT BEEN CONVICTED IN ANY CASE. IF THE SUPREME COURT FINDS THAT HE'S IMMUNE AND CANNOT BE PROSECUTED, IT WILL BE AN ENORMOUS BLOW AND THE ENTIRE CASE WILL GO AWAY >>. I SHOULD ASK THAT THE FACT THAT THE COURT HAS RULED THIS WAY TO TAKE UP THE CASE, IS THAT A PROMISE, IN WHICH WAY THEY ARE LEANING? >>. THEY SAY THAT, KNOWING THE HE WOULD AFFECT, THEY ARE NOT WEIGHING IN ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. IT DOES SIGNAL THE GRAVITY OF THE ISSUE REALIZING THE JUSTICES, REALIZING THAT THEY, AS A HIGH COURT, HAVE TO RESOLVE THIS. TWO TO THAT QUESTION. I KNOW THERE WAS A LOT OF SPECULATION FROM LEGAL SCHOLARS THAT THE COURT WOULD NOT WANT TO TAKE THIS. THEY WILL LET THE APPEALS COURT RULING STAND. >>. YOU ARE RIGHT. I WAS AT AN EVENT THIS MORNING WHERE A LOT OF FORMER JUSTICE OFFICIALS AND LEGAL EXPERTS AND THAT SEEMED TO BE THE CONSENSUS THEY DID NOT BELIEVE THE SUPREME COURT WOULD TAKE THIS CASE. THEY THOUGHT THE PLEAS SUBSTANTIALLY DELAYE HECOURT WOULD RULE THE DAY THAT ULTIMATELY IS NOT WHAT HAPPENED HERE. OTHERS HAVE SAID THIS WILL SUBSTANTIALLY DELAY THE POTENTIAL FOR THIS CASE TO GO TO TRIAL IS THERE TO RUN INTO POLICY ABOUT NOT INFLUENCING AN ELECTION. THE DOJ POLICY- IT'S NOT A LAW. IT SUGGESTS THAT THE JUSTICES SHOULD NOT TAKE ACTION. ACTION, ACTION, ACTION AROUND AN ELECTION, SO IT'S AN OPEN WITHIN 30 OR 60 DAYS. IT IS NOT SET IN STONE AROUND AN ELECTION TO INFLUENCE THE ELECTION. THERE'S AN OPEN QUESTION. IF THAT WOULD APPLY IN THIS CASE. HE IS ALREADY BEEN INDICTED, SO IT'S NOT LIKE A NEW THING THAT THEY WILL BLOW OUT. IT'S UNCHARTED TERRITORY. ANOTHER QUESTION: COULD THEY TAKE THIS TO TRIAL AFTER THE ELECTION, IF MR TRUMP IS ELECTED PRESIDENT BUT NOT INAUGURATED? SO MANY NEW QUESTIONS ARRIVING IN THE UNCHARTED MOMENT. >>. CHUCK TODD IS WITH US. IT SEEMS LIKE IT NEEDS TO BE CHARTERED VERY QUICKLY. BUT THIS OPENS UP A LOT OF CANS F: THE UNCHARTED TERRITORY. IT SEEMS LIKE IT NEEDS TO BE CHARTED QUICKLY. IT OPENS UP A LOT OF CANS OF WORMS >>. IT DOES FOR THE TIMING OF THIS TRIAL. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE VARIOUS LEGAL ISSUES THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS POLITICALLY, THE ONLY ONE THAT MIGHT MOVE VOTES IS THE JACK SMITH TRIAL. IMES SKEPTICAL OF THE ALVIN BRAGG -- WE HAVE SEEN THE E JEAN CARROLL CIVIL VERDICTS. IT HAS NOT MOVED MEMBERS OR HAD POLITICAL IMPACT ON TRUMP. NOTABLES WHO COULD BE, BECAUSE OF ALL THE PARADE OF NOTABLES WHO COULD BE TESTIFYING AGAINST DONALD TRUMP, INCLUDING MARK MEADOWS AND BILL BARR, PERHAPS THE FORMER VICE PRESIDENT, MIKE PENCE. THAT IS A MUCH DIFFERENT THING. IF THIS HAPPENS IN THE SUMMER, BEFORE THE CONVENTION. IF IT DOES NOT HAPPEN BY NOVEMBER, I THINK IT IS ONE HUGE IMPEDIMENT BEING REMOVED FROM DONALD TRUMP'S PATH TO THE WHITE HOUSE. I DO NOT KNOW IF HE CAN POLITICALLY SURVIVE THE PUBLIC HEARINGS THAT WILL COME FROM THE JACK SMITH TRIAL, WHICH IS WHY HE IS FIGHTING SO HARD TO GET THIS DELAYED OR GET RID OF IT. RID OF IT >>. I WILL BRINONEG, WE'LL SECATHERINE, LAY OUT CHRISTIAN. THERE'S A QUESTION OF HOW THIS WILL BE SPUN. WE WILL SEE THAT PLAY OUT. THE NEXT FEW MINUTES OR HOURS IS THE -- IS THERE A WINNER HERE IN THE WINTER IS DONALD TRUMP. WE HAVE DELAY. THIS ENSURES THAT THE TRIAL WILL NOT HAPPEN BEFORE ELECTION. WILL NOT HAPPEN BEFORE ELECTION. THE DECISION IMMU TY HE'LLIF. IT IS THAT HE DOES NOT HAVE IMMUNITY. THEY WILL TRY TO MOVE HEAVEN AND EARTH TO GET IT ONE BEFORE ELECTION DAY. THIS CASE IS ON HOLD. IT WILL NOT BE TRIED BEFORE ELECTION DAY. >>. WHAT DO YOU THINK? WHY DO YOU THINK THE COURT WANTS TO TAKE THIS UP? >>. THESE ARE QUESTIONS I HAVE NEVER BEEN ANSWERED BEFORE. THE JUDGE SAID THAT PRESIDENTS ARE NOT --. IT IS ONE THAT THE COURT KNOWS IT HAS TO RESOLVE T CAME BACK WITHIN A WEEK WITH A DECISION. L SOME OF THE OTHERS ON YOUR PANEL. THE TIMING IS EVERYTHING, EVEN IF THE SUPREME COURT CAME BACK WITHIN A WEEK WITH A DECISION LIKE THIS, MR TRUMP. SO GET THE BENEFIT OF ALL OF THE TIME THAT HAS BEEN ON HOLD THE FIRST WEEK OF DECEMBER. NOW WE ARE APPROACHING END OF MARCH. HE GETS THE BENEFIT OF ALL OF THAT- NEARLY 3 MONTHS TO WORK ALL OF THIS OUT. EVEN IF IT CAME OUT IN APRIL, THE TIMING WORKS IN HIS FAVOR. >>. THAT CONCLUDES THIS SPECIAL REPORT. WE WILL HAVE MORE COMING UP ON NBC NEWS NOW ONLINE AND NBC NEWSCOM. I WILL SEE YOU SHORTLY FOR NBC NIGHTLY NEWS. I AM LESTER HOLT. THANK YOU FOR WATCHING AND GOOD DAY >>>. YOU HAVE BEEN WATCHING A >>>. YOU HAVE BEEN WATCHING A SPECIAL REPORT: THE SIGNIFICANT DECISION BY THE SUPREME COURT TO TAKE UP THE CASE ON WHETHER OR NOT FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP SHOULD BE ABLE TO CLAIM IMMUNITY OVER SOME OF THE CRIMINAL ELECTION INTERFERENCE CHARGES. HE IS FACING THE DATES TO CIRCLE ON YOUR CALENDAR: THE WEEK OF APRIL 27,. THEY WILL TAKE ON THE ORAL ARGUMENT IT COULD TAKE MONTHS TO RESOLVE MONICA ALBA IS POSTED AT THE WHITE HOUSE. I WILL ASK YOU TO TAKE OFF YOUR HAT AND PUT ON YOUR CAMPAIGN REPORTER HAT, SOMEONE FOR MANY YEARS WHO HAS COVERED CAMPAIGNS. WHEN WE LOOK AT THE LANDSCAPE BETWEEN APRIL 22nd AND NOVEMBER, THERE IS A LOT AT STAKE FOR FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP. SOME INDICATIONS FOR WHAT THE SUPREME COURT ACTUALLY DOES >>. CERTAINLY THIS IS SIGNIFICANT IN THIS SCOPE, BECAUSE WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS COULD BE, HOW LONG THIS COULD GO. THE FACT THAT THE POLITICAL CALENDAR- WE HAVE BEEN TALKING SO LONG ABOUT DONALD TRUMP HAVING TWO CALENDARS, HIS LEGAL BASE- SUPPORTS THE TRIAL OF EVERYTHING. WE HAVE SEEN HOW THAT PLAYS OUT VERSUS THE POLITICAL CALENDAR, THE PRIMARY CALENDAR, AND WHAT WE HAVE SEEN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS AND MONTHS, THE CASES ON THE SAME, AS I DID. NOW WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE MAJOR QUESTION- THAT IS THE ENTIRETY OF THESE THINGS: CAN A PRESIDENT HAVE IMMUNITY FROM ALLEGED CRIMES WHILE HE WAS IN OFFICE? WE ARE TALKING ABOUT MAJOR ELECTION INTERFERENCE CASE- JACK SMITH, INVESTIGATION AS TO WHAT HAPPENED, LEADING UP TO JANUARY 6th AND FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S EFFORTS TO OVERTURN THE RESULTS OF THE 2020 ELECTION. THE FACT THAT THE SUPREME COURT IS TAKING UP THIS CASE MEANS THAT WE DO NOT KNOW WHEN THEY COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE A RESOLUTION OR A RULING ON THAT AND DEPENDING ON WHAT THAT IS, THEN WE WOULD HAVE TO SEE WHETHER THERE WOULD BE ENOUGH TIME FOR THERE TO BE A TRIAL. IF IT IS FOUND THAT HE IS NOT IMMUNE FROM THOSE ALLEGED CHARGES, THEN YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT A VERY NARROW WINDOW VERY FEW MONTHS, POTENTIALLY, WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A LARGER ELECTION INTERFERENCE TRIAL TAKE PLACE AHEAD OF NOVEMBER. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THIS TRIAL DID HAVE A DATE. IT WAS SUPPOSED TO TAKE PLACE IN THE COMING WEEKS. NOW, WHERE THIS WENT TO THE SUPREME COURT, IT HAS CHANGED THAT. THAT IS WHERE WE ARE. WE REALLY DO NOT HAVE A PLAYBOOK FOR WHAT HAPPENS FROM HERE, BECAUSE IT IS TOTALLY UNCHARTED WATER LEGALLY AND UNCHARTED WATER LEGALLY AND POLITICALLY. >>. ON THE SPECIAL REPORT, LOTS OF CANS OF WORMS WILL BE OPENED. LET ME GO TO GARRETT, WHO IS JOINING US. MONICA IS TALKING ABOUT THE PROCESS THAT LED US HERE. I WANT TO REMIND FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS CRIMINAL CASE FORMER. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BECOME CITIZEN TRUMP WITH ALL THE DEFENSES OF ANY OTHER CRIMINAL DEFENDANT. IT IS EXACTLY THIS TEAM TRUMP IS PUSHING BACK ON IT NOW. I CANNOT IMAGINE. IN THE LAST 85 SECONDS YOU HEARD ANYTHING. BUT THEY WILL BE FULL STEAM, AHEAD TO MAKE THEIR CASE NOT JUST IN THE SUPREME COURT BUT IN THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION. COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION >>. SO FAR, NEITHER THE CAMPAIGN NOR THE CANDIDATE HAVE COMMENTED ON THIS DEVELOPMENT. I CAN TELL YOU THAT THEY EXPECTED IT WOULD COME TO THIS. THEY WERE ALWAYS CONFIDENT. THEY WOULD GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO ARGUE THIS MATTER IN FRONT OF THE SUPREME COURT BY THAT LANGUAGE. TODAY, THE QUESTION WHETHER DONALD TRUMP IS CITIZEN TRUMP OR PRESIDENT TRUMP. BECAUSE I'M ALSO COVERING MITCH McCONNELL TODAY WITH HIS DECISION TO LEAVE AS THE LEADER OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. THE DAY AFTER HE VOTED TO ACQUIT DONALD TRUMP FOR HIS ROLE IN JANUARY 6th, IN THE SECOND APPOINTMENT, HE SAT ON THE FLOOR AND MADE AN ARGUMENT THAT THE APPEALS COURT IS MAKING. NOW THAT HE'S NO LONGER PRESIDENT, DONALD TRUMP WILL BE SEGMENT TO THE POSSIBLE CRIMINAL CASES THAT ANY NORMAL CITIZEN WOULD, THE POLITICAL ARGUMENT BEING MADE TO NOT IMPEACHMENT. IT COMES UP AGAIN ON THIS DAY AS DONALD TRUMP IS FINDING THAT THE THEORY WILL BE TESTED BEFORE THE HIGHEST COURT, INCLUDING THREE MEMBERS. HE INCLUDING THREE MEMBERS. HE HELPED SEAT. IT'S THE ULTIMATE GOLD CIRCLE MOMENT FOR SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN BREWING FOR THREE PLUS YEARS. >>. YOU ARE RIGHT AS IT RELATES TO WHAT MITCH McCONNELL HAS DONE TO RESHAPE THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY, LEADING DIRECTLY TO CRITICAL MOMENTS FOR THE SUPREME COURT, INCLUDING THE MOST IMPORTANT DECISION THAT FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL FACE IN HIS TIME IN OFFICE, IN OR OUT OF OFFICE >>. Reporter: ABSOLUTELY DONALD TRUMP. McCONNELL MADE THE DECISION NOT TO HOLD THE DECISION FOR MERRICK GARLAND. IT LED TO GORE SUCH AND TWO OTHER CONSERVATIVES ON THE COURT. WHO WILL HEAR THE CASE OF DONALD TRUMP AND WHETHER NOT. HE IS IMMUNE. IT WILL NOT BE DECIDED EARLY. IT DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE DECIDED ON THE CASE OF MR TRUMP. READING THIS ORDER FROM -- WE COULD FIND OURSELVES DOWN A RABBIT HOLE OR A CONSTITUTIONAL CAN OF WORMS. >>. THANK YOU SO MUCH. I KNOW YOU HAVE 1 MILLION MORE PHONE CALLS TO MAKE. THE SUPREME COURT HAS NOT HAD TO FACE THIS BEFORE. THESE ARE ISSUES THAT THERE IS NOT A LOT TO LOOK TO AS FAR AS PREVIOUS RULING FOR THE SUPREME COURT TO TAKE A LOOK AT. IT IS A COURT THAT IS MAJORITY LEANING, CONSERVATIVE BECAUSE OF THE ACTIONS, SPECIFICALLY OF FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP >>. I'M NOT SURE. THIS IS PARTICULARLY A IDEOLOGICAL ISSUE FOR PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY. I WAS AT AN EVENT THIS MORNING WITH LEGAL SCHOLARS AND THE CONSENSUS ACROSS. THE ROOM WAS THAT THE SUPREME COURT WAS NOT GOING TO TAKE THIS CASE BECAUSE THE COURT OF APPEALS AND THE RULING AGAINST MR TRUMP WAS SO WELL REASONED AND RESOUNDING AND LOGICAL. OBVIOUSLY THEY WERE WRONG. I CAN SPECULATE AS TO WHY IT ALWAYS HAS BEEN THAT PRESIDENTS CAN BE INDICTED. THAT'S WHY GERALD FORD PARDONED NIXON TO THE MINDS OF MOST LEGAL SCHOLARS. THAT IS NOT THE ISSUE. THAT IS SUE IS THAT THERE ARE CRIMINAL CONDUCT THAT YOU CAN IMAGINE A COURT WOULD WANT TO SAY A PRESIDENT IS IMMUNE FOR THOSE ACTIONS, PARTICULARLY AROUND NATIONAL SECURITY. BROCK OBAMA ORDERED A DRONE STRIKE AGAINST A AMERICAN CITIZEN, ABROAD, AND MANY SCHOLARS CONSIDER THAT TO BE A CRIME UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW. WHAT IF SOME PROSECUTOR OR STATE? WHAT IF SOME PROSECUTOR OR STATE PROSECUTOR BROUGHT A CASE AGAINST BROCK OBAMA? THAT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT MOST PEOPLE WILL SAY PROBABLY SHOULD NOT HAPPEN. THE PRESIDENT IS MAKING NATIONAL SECURITY DECISIONS ON THE ADVICE OF HIS CABINET AND LAWYERS- THOSE OF THE KIND OF THINGS YOU CAN IMAGINE. THE SUPREME COURT IS GRAPPLING WITH COMING UP WITH A WAY TO LOOK AT THIS. PRESIDENTS CANNOT COMMIT MURDER, BUT THERE MIGHT BE SOME ASPECT OF THIS CONDUCT THAT SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO IMMUNITY. THAT WILL BE THE PLAY IN THIS DECISION. >>. THANK YOU. >> THANK YOU. LET ME BRING CAROLANNE FOLLOW ALONG THAT PATH. THE CENTRAL QUESTION THAT THE JUSTICES ARE CONSIDERING, COMING THE WEEK OF APRIL 22nd, HOW SHOULD WE PEOPLE BE THINKING ABOUT THAT AND LISTENING TO THE CONVERSATION? >>. WHAT THE COURT SAYS IN ORDER IS PRETTY CLEAR: WHETHER A FORMER PRESIDENT CAN BE CRIMINALLY CHARGED OR HELD AT TRIAL ON CHARGES OF HAVING COMMITTED A CRIME IF HE HAS ACTUALLY DONE AND ALLEGE IT OFFICIAL ACT AS PRESIDENT. THE KEY HERE IT IS WHETHER HE CAN BE CRIMINALLY PROSECUTED AND TO WHAT EXTENT. THAT CAN REALLY OPEN UP A CAN OF WORMS, BECAUSE THAT CAN GO INTO A WHOLE BUNCH OF HISTORY AND IT CAN TAKE A LOT OF TIME. THAT, REALLY, IS THE ISSUE HERE. WE CAN TALK ABOUT LEGAL NICETIES AND ABOUT WITH THE PARAMETERS OF THIS DECISION ARE GOING TO STOP BUT THE REAL KEY QUESTION IS HOW MUCH TIME WILL IT TAKE? IT IS SUCH A BROAD QUESTION THAT IT IS POSSIBLE. IT HAS TAKEN THIS COURT WEEKS JUST TO DECIDE WHETHER TO HEAR THE CASE OR NOT. IT TOOK THE DC CIRCUIT FAR LONGER THAN MANY PEOPLE THOUGHT TO COME OUT WITH THIS OPINION. THIS IS NOT AN EASY ISSUE JUST FOR THE CHIEF JUSTICE TO GET SOME CONSENSUS ON WHAT THE OPINION WILL TAKE, WHO WILL WRITE IT AND WHO WILL WRITE THE OPINION, IF ANYONE. IT COULD TAKE WEEKS >>. YOU THINK, >> HEARING THE ARGUMENTS IN? >>. HEARING THE ARGUMENTS IN APRIL. IT MEANS IT COULD GO ONLY UP UNTIL THE 28th OR 29.. GENERALLY THEY COME OUT WITH THEIR OPINION BY THE FIRST WEEK OF JUNE. I THINK THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO DO BEFORE THEY TAKE THEIR BREAK. THEY ARE GOING TO COME OUT WITH AN OPINION ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, MOST LIKELY BY THE FIRST OF --. >>. CHUCK TODD, IS HE CITIZEN TRUMP? AS IT RELATES TO THE PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY YOU HEARD ABOUT THE CAN OF WORMS >>. I CANNOT IMAGINE THAT THE WHOLE POINT OF THE FOUNDING OF THE UNITED STATES WAS TO GET OUT OF ANARCHY. I CANNOT IMAGINE THAT SOMEHOW FORMER PRESIDENTS WILL GET ANY FORM OF IMMUNITY BASED ON PERSONAL ACTIONS, DECISIONS THEY MAKE AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF IS A DIFFERENT QUESTION. I CANNOT IMAGINE THAT IT IS GOING TO GO IN A DIRECTION THAT SHOCKS US TO UPEND ALL OF OUR ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT WHAT THE RULE OF LAW IS SUPPOSED TO BE. BUT NOBODY IS ABOVE THE LAW. THAT PHRASE IS SOMETHING WE HAVE SAID FOR YEARS. I WE REALLY GOING TO HAVE A SUPREME COURT- SAY THAT ACTUALLY, THERE ARE 45 PEOPLE- IF THEY ARE, THERE ARE 45 PEOPLE- IF THEY ARE ALIVE CAN BE ABOVE LAW IF THEY ARE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, IT DOES NOT COMPUTE. THE REAL QUESTION: HOW DO THEY DO IT? HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE THEM? THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND: THIS TRIAL IS THE ONLY ONE THAT CAN HAVE TRUE POLITICAL IMPACT ON TRUMP, BECAUSE IT WILL FEATURE -- SO MANY FAMILIAR FACES IN GOVERNMENT DURING THE TRUMP TERM. THE TIMING OF THAT MIKE PENCE TESTIFYING AGAINST DONALD TRUMP BEFORE THE CONVENTIONS -- BY THE WAY, THIS IS SOMETHING FOR THE DOJ REPORTING TEAM. IS THERE A POINT WHERE JACK SMITH IS IN THE WINDOW OF INFLUENCING AN ELECTION AND THERE IS THOUGHT OF DELAYING THE TRIAL, THOUGHT OF DELAYING THE TRIAL TILL AFTER NOVEMBER? I WILL BE VERY CURIOUS IF THEY ARE LOOKING AT SOMETHING IN DECEMBER, IF THEY WILL START A TRIAL LESS THAN 90 DAYS BEFORE AN ELECTION >>. ANOTHER QUESTION THAT WE HAVE. WE WILL BE WATCHING, THANK YOU. WE HAVE BEEN ON THE AIR WITH. WE HAVE BEEN ON THE AIR WITH THIS PIECE OF DEVELOPING NEWS IN WASHINGTON >>>. WE HAVE MORE BREAKING NEWS COMING INTO US FROM WASHINGTON, SPECIFICALLY ON THE POTENTIAL FOR A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN. WE HAVE NEW DETAILS ON A LAST- MINUTE DEAL THAT APPARENTLY HAS JUST COME TOGETHER. WE WILL TAKE A LOOK IN A SECONDARY >>>. LATE RESULTS FROM THE PRESIDENTS PHYSICAL. WE SKIMMED THROUGH THIS WITH OUR MEDICAL TEAM AS IT RELATES TO THE PRESIDENTS HEALTH >>>. STAY WITH US HERE ON NBC NEWS NOW >>>. BREAKING NEWS NOW OUT OF >>> BREAKING NEWS NOW OUT OF CAPITOL HILL. THE POTENTIAL FOR A SHOT DOWN HAS THEM THE SHADOW HANGING OVER WASHINGTON. THE POSSIBILITY THAT THERE COULD BE A PARTIAL HUTDOWN COMING THIS WEEKEND TURNS OUT. IT LOOKS LIKE IT WILL BE AVOIDED. THERE IS A CAVEAT. AVOID IT. FOR NOW. LET ME BRING THE CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT. ANOTHER SERIES OF KICKING. THE. ANOTHER SERIES OF KICKING. THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD >>>. YOU ARE RIGHT, THEY ARE GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION, IN PART BECAUSE OF WHAT SPEAKER, IN PART BECAUSE OF WHAT SPEAKER MIKE JOHNSON HAS SAID WITH THE NEGOTIATIONS AROUND. ANOTHER SHORT-TERM SPENDING PLAN TO GIVE THEM MORE TIME TO NEGOTIATE. HE WANTED SOMETHING IN WRITING THAT THEY WERE READY TO PASS THE FIRST BILLS. JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO THEY SAID THEY HAVE MADE AN AGREEMENT ON THE FIRST ROUND THAT WILL BE FUNDED. THEY NEED A LITTLE MORE TIME TO DOUBT THE EYES AND CROSS TEES TO GIVE LAWMAKERS ENOUGH TIME TO READ THROUGH THE DOCUMENTS THEY WILL PASS IS LIKELY AS TOMORROW A SHORT TO RESOLUTION THAT WILL EXTEND THE FIRST GROUP OF FUNDING BILLS THROUGH MARCH 8th. THE FIRST SIX WILL BE DONE. UNTIL -- THE MUCH BIGGER BILLS NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. GET AN IDEA: AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, TRANSPORTATION, DEVELOPMENT, TRANSPORTATION, ALL OF THAT. AND ON THE 22nd THOSE OF THE BIG ITEMS: DEFENSE DEPARTMENT, FINANCIAL SERVICES, GENERAL GOVERNMENT. SO ONE >>. IS IT A POLITICAL WIN FOR? >>. IS IT A POLITICAL WIN FOR HOUSE SPEAKER JOHNSON >>. Reporter, THE CHALLENGES THAT HE'S DEALING WITH IT IS A WIN. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO FULLY TAKE A LOOK AT HOW THIS WILL IMPACT HIM POLITICALLY UNTIL AFTER WE SEE THE ACTION ON THE FLOOR. THE CONSERVATIVE BASE IS GIVING HIM A HARD TIME WITH THE BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS. HATE THE IDEA OF SHORT-TERM SPENDING PLANS. THEY HAVE NOT APPROVED THE OVERALL SPENDING NUMBER THAT HE AGREED TO WITH DEMOCRATS AND MITCH McCONNELL. IT'S LIKELY THAT THERE WILL BE A BIG CHUNK OF HOUSE REPUBLICANS THAT MOVE OH NO ON THE SPENDING BILLS WHEN THEY COME TO THE FLOOR. FIGURE JOHNSON REALIZES THAT NO MATTER WHAT. THERE IS NO SCENARIO BY WHICH HE CAN GET THAT GROUP TO VOTE YES AND GET THESE PASSED INTO LAW TO AVOID A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN TO BE ABLE TO NAVIGATE THIS WITH A HUGE OUTCRY FROM REPUBLICANS. IT WILL BE A POLITICAL WIN FOR HIM AND THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ACCOMPLISHMENT HE HAS HAD. >>. IT HAS BEEN. -- I'M GLAD YOU HAD A CHANCE TO GET REST. >>>. THE LAST 30 MINUTES WE GOT THE RESULTS OF PRESIDENT BIDEN'S ANNUAL PHYSICAL ACCORDING TO HIS DOCTORS, NO NEW CONCERNS IN THE LAST YEAR. HE CONTINUES TO BE FIT FOR DUTY, THEY SAY, TO FULLY EXECUTE RESPONSIBILITIES WITHOUT ACCOMMODATIONS. HERE'S HOW THE PRESIDENT DESCRIBED HIS PHYSICAL. AFTER GETTING THAT, THE LAST COUPLE OF HOURS LISTEN. YOU HEAR THE PRESIDENT SAY. YOU HEAR THE PRESIDENT SAY. NOTHING DIFFERENT FROM LESTER. WE BRING MONACO. WHO IS OUTSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE? THE WHITE HOUSE WALK US THROUGH >>. Reporter. THIS IS A PARTIAL PHYSICAL. THERE WAS NOT A COLONOSCOPY, HE WAS NOT UNDER ANESTHESIA. HE DID NOT HAVE TO HAND OVER A 32 VICE PRESIDENT. HE WILL HAVE THE COMPLETE MEDICAL EXAM. -- TODAY HE DID A PARTIAL PHYSICAL. HE HAS SLEEP APNEA, WHICH HAS BEEN DISCLOSED FOR YEARS. THE FACT HE HAS BEEN USING WHAT IS KNOWN AS A CPAP MACHINE. AT NIGHT HE USES THAT TO HELP WITH HIS BREATHING TO REGULATE THAT THE DOCTOR SAID IT'S HAD A BIG EFFECT ON IMPROVEMENT. THERE ARE A COUPLE OTHER THINGS LIKE A NEW MEDICATION HE IS TAKING CALLED NEXIUM. THERE'S A LITTLE BIT ABOUT -- SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN DETAILED. WHEN YOU SEE HIM WALK, IT IS EVIDENT. THAT'S CONNECTED WITH A FOOT INJURY HE'S HAD FROM THE PAST ALSO, NOTABLY BECAUSE THERE WAS DISCUSSION ABOUT WHETHER HE WOULD DO A COGNITIVE TEST. THERE WAS NO COGNITIVE EXAM AS PART OF THIS. FURTHER WAS A NEUROLOGICAL EXAM, AND THERE WERE NO DISORDERS THAT WERE FOUND HERE. ACCORDING TO HIS NEUROLOGIST, HE IS THE ONE WHO AGREED WITH THE PRESIDENT- STUCK HER- THAT THERE WAS NOT A NEED FOR A COGNITIVE TEST. >>. LET ME PLAY SOME OF THIS. >>. LET ME PLAY SOME OF THIS BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT DEFENDED HIMSELF ON THAT ISSUE. IT GOES BEYOND THE PERSONAL TO. IT GOES BEYOND THE PERSONAL TO POLITICAL. PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS ONLY FOUR YEARS YOUNGER. LET ME PLAY WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID WHEN THE REPORT CAME OUT DESCRIBING HIM AS A WELL MEANING ELDERLY MAN. >> I AM AN ELDERLY MAN. MY MEMORY IS FINE. >>. Reporter, AMERICANS HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT YOUR AGE, FOR >> THAT IS YOUR JUDGMENT >>. THIS WEEK WE SAW HIM TAKING A DIFFERENT TASK ABOUT QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS AGE. HE ALWAYS HAD A JOKING ATTITUDE. HE ALWAYS HAD A JOKING ATTITUDE ABOUT IT. THEY THINK I AM TOO YOUNG. HE'S STARTING TO GO AFTER DONALD TRUMP FOR HIS AGE AS WELL >>. HE TRIED TO DEFUSE THE AGE. >>. HE TRIED TO DEFUSE THE AGE THING BUT WE DID SEE A NEW RESPONSE ON SETH MEYERS. HE SAID: YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT MY OPPONENT IS ALMOST MY AGE ALSO. THE THINGS HE INTRODUCED AS NEW. YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT HIS IDEAS. THEY ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PAST AND PRESENT. MAYBE WE WILL SEE A WEEK FROM TONIGHT AT THE STATE OF THE UNION TRYING TO TALK ABOUT THE FUTURE AND TO PREVENT THE DIFFERENT VISION AND THE CONTRAST IN VALUES WHEN IT COMES TO THIS. IT IS SOMETHING THAT BIDEN EIGHTH TALK ABOUT. CONSTANTLY, FOR A WHILE THEY TRIED TO DISMISS THE ISSUE OF AGE BUT THEY KNOW THEY CANNOT. >>. MONICA ELBA, THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING WITH US. >>>. THE WIDOW SAID SHE'S CONCERNED THAT POLICE ARREST PEOPLE WHO SHOW UP TO HER HUSBAND'S FUNERAL THE SAME DAY AS LATIMER POLLUTANTS SPEECH IN SUPREME COURT NEWS. THEY ARE IN SUPREME COURT NEWS. THEY ARE SPLIT OVER BUMP STOCKS. THAT'S THE GUN ACCESSORY THAT LETS SEMI AUTOMATIC GUNS FIRE FASTER. THEY WERE ESSENTIALLY BANNED AFTER THE MASS SHOOTING IN LAS VEGAS.

MORE ON, WHAT IS MAKING THIS SO HARD TO FIGHT? LATER IN THE SHOW, WE ARE STARTING ON THE MAJOR BREAKING NEWS OUT OF THE SUPREME COURT THIS EVENING, THE JUSTICES AGREEING TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP CAN CLAIM PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY OVER THE CRIMINAL ELECTION INTERFERENCE CHARGES HE'S FACING. WE ARE GOING TO HEAR THE CASE THE WEEK OF APRIL 22nd MID TO LATE APRIL. IT IS A CASE THAT COULD TAKE MONTHS TO RESOLVE AND IT COULD DIRECTLY ALLIED WITH THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. IN FACT, IT IS ALL BUT GUARANTEED TO COLLIDE WITH THE ELECTION-YEAR. WE HAVE TEAM COVERAGE FROM EVERY ANGLE: THE LEGAL, POLITICAL AND MORE. KENNETH DeLANEY, LET ME START WITH: YOU BE A MAJOR UPSTATE FROM THE SUPREME COURT. WILL THEY TAKE THIS CASE UP, WON'T THEY? THE ANSWER IS THEY WILL. BUT THAT IS ONE ANSWER, WITH A WHOLE LOT OF QUESTIONS COMING UP >>. IT SURE IS HALLIE. THIS IS A USUALLY CONSEQUENTIAL MOVE. A LOT OF EXPERTS THOUGHT THE. A LOT OF EXPERTS THOUGHT THE COURT MIGHT LET THAT APPEALS COURT RULING STAND, THE ONE THAT RESOUNDINGLY SAID THAT DONALD TRUMP DID NOT HAVE PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY, THAT NO PRESIDENT AFTER LEAVING OFFICE WAS IMMUNE FROM PROSECUTION. IT WAS A LENGTHY AND WELL REASONED OPINION. MANY PEOPLE THOUGHT BUT THE SUPREME COURT HAS DECIDED IT WANTS TO WEIGH IN. WHAT THAT MEANS LOGISTICALLY IS A SIGNIFICANT DELAY IN THIS CASE, THIS ELECTION CASE BROUGHT BY SPECIAL COUNSEL JACK SMITH AGAINST DONALD TRUMP FROM GOING TO TRIAL. NOW, IF THE COURT HEARS THESE ARGUMENTS IN APRIL AND THEN COMES BACK WITH A RULING IN JUNE WHERE THEY ARE EXPECTED TO RELEASE A LOT OF OTHER RULINGS, CONCEIVABLY YOU COULD SEE A TRIAL AT SOME POINT OVER THE SUMMER, MAYBE BEFORE THE ELECTION. THERE ARE A LOT OF WILDCARD, A LOT OF THINGS THAT COULD EVENTUALLY DELAY THAT IT REALLY LEAVES LESS WORK AND FOR ERROR, MAKES IT MORE LIKELY TO IMPACT AND WON'T GO TO TRIAL. IT'S A HUGE MOMENT FOR THE COUNTRY. NO COURT UNTIL THE APPEALS COURT DECISION HAD EVER RULED ON THE QUESTION OF WHETHER A PRESIDENT AFTER LEAVING OFFICE COULD BE CHARGED WITH CRIMES IN CONNECTION WITH THEIR CONDUCT IN OFFICE. CLEARLY, THE SUPREME COURT HAS DECIDED THAT THERE IS SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE SAID ABOUT, THAT BY THE HIGHEST COURT IN THE LAND EVEN THOUGH MOST PEOPLE HAVE ASSUMED FOR GENERATIONS. PRESIDENTS COULD BE CHARGED AFTER ALL. THAT IS WHY GERALD, AFTER ALL. THAT IS WHY GERALD FORD PARDONED RICHARD NIXON. AFTER ONE WATERGATE IT WAS ASSUMED RICHARD NIXON WOULD BE INDICTED FOR CRIMES HE COMMITTED DURING WATERGATE. AT THE SAME TIME, THERE WERE DECISIONS PRESIDENTS MAKE ALL THE TIME IN NATIONAL SECURITY CONTEXTS THAT ARE CONTROVERSIAL, THAT SOME PEOPLE SAY ARE CRIMES, AND THERE SEEMS TO BE A CONSENSUS AMONG LEGAL SCHOLARS. IT WOULD BE A BAD IDEA TO HAVE PROSECUTORS CALLING A PRESIDENT"" AFTER THEY LEAVE OFFICE. FOR THINGS LIKE THAT, THERE'S A LOT FOR THE COURT TO CHEW ON HERE. >>. AND THE KEY QUESTION HERE. I JUST WANT TO REMIND PEOPLE BECAUSE, WHEN THIS HAPPENS, WE GOT A TON OF COVERAGE ON THE APPEALS COURT WHEN IT CAME DOWN WITH ITS RULING OF COURSE- THE RULING, THE METEOROLOGIST BILL KARINS IS NOW APPEALING. THEY SET FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS CRIMINAL CASE, THIS FEDERAL ELECTION INTERFERENCE CASE, FORMER, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BECOME CITIZEN TRUMP. IT IS THE CITIZEN TRUMP IDEA THAT IS AT THE CENTER OF THIS AND IS AT THE CENTER OF WHAT THE JUSTICES WILL HAVE TO DECIDE. CAN JUSTICES WHO, BY THE WAY, HAVE NOW A CONSERVATIVE LEANING MAJORITY- THANKS TO FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP INSTALLING THREE OF THEM IN HIS TIME IN OFFICE. THIS IDEOLOGY PLAYED A PART IN THIS. >>. TO A LIMITED EXTENT, SOME OF THOSE CONSERVATIVE JUSTICES TEND TO HAVE AN EXPENSIVE VIEW OF EXECUTIVE POWER THAT MAY MIX THEM MORE LIKELY TO LEAN IN THE DIRECTION OF IMMUNITY. BUT THE GUARDIAN AS WAS RAISED. BUT THE GUARDIAN AS WAS RAISED DURING THE APPEALS COURT HEARING THAT WAS DONALD TRUMP'S ARGUMENT THAT A PRESIDENT COULD COMMISSION THE NAVY SEALS TO ASSASSINATE HIS POLITICAL OPPONENT AND COULD NOT BE PROSECUTED AFTER LEAVING OFFICE UNLESS HE WAS FIRST IMPEACHED. THAT JUST SEEMS SO OUTSIDE THE LEGAL MAINSTREAM. IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE ANY COURT ADOPTING THAT VIEW. SO IT IS HARD TO SEE. YOU KNOW HOW IT GOES IN THAT DIRECTION BUT, NONETHELESS, IT IS A BIG DEAL. IT'S A BIG MOMENT FOR THE COURT. THERE WILL BE HUGE CONSEQUENCE IS GOING FORWARD. >>. KENNETH DeLANEY, THANK YOU SO MUCH. I WANT TO GET TO VON HILLARY NOW. IN THE LAST 30 SECONDS AS KEN WAS SPEAKING, WE HAVE OUR FIRST REACTION FROM FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP WITH THIS POST ON HIS SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM. TALK US THROUGH IT. I'M READING IT AS WE SPEAK. I HAVEN'T HAD THE CHANCE TO DIGEST THIS. IT IS ON HIS MIND, OBVIOUSLY >>. IT IS A TWO-PAGE STATEMENT: ""LEGAL SCHOLARS ARE EXTREMELY THANKFUL FOR THE SUPREME COURT'S DECISION TODAY TO TAKE UP PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY. WITHOUT PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY, A PRESIDENT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PROPERLY FUNCTION OR MAKE DECISIONS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA"". AS KEN JUST OUTLINED, THE SUPREME COURT AGREED TO LOOK AT A LIMITED SCOPE OF THIS DIRECTLY, AS IT CORRELATES TO DONALD TRUMP: SPECIFIC CHARGES BROUGHT AGAINST HIM AND WHETHER HE WAS ACTING IN A OFFICIAL CAPACITY AND THEREFORE HAD IMMUNITY. FROM THESE CHARGES STEMMING FROM HIS EFFORTS- ALLEGED EFFORTS- TO OVERTURN THE 2020 ELECTION. THAT IS SEPARATE FROM WHAT DONALD TRUMP WAS HOPING WOULD BE HEARD IN ITS ENTIRETY. HE WAS HOPING THAT THE SUPREME COURT WOULD HEAR THE CASE ON, WHETHER A PRESIDENT HAS FULL PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY ESSENTIALLY CAN DO WHATEVER THEY WANT, WITHOUT FEAR OF BEING PROSECUTED UPON LEAVING THE WHITE HOUSE. THE SUPREME COURT HAS SAID THEY WOULD LOOK SPECIFICALLY AT DONALD TRUMP'S CASE AND THE FEDERAL ELECTION INTERFERENCE CHARGES AGAINST HIM. >> TALK ABOUT THE POLITICAL INDICATIONS HERE. IN LOOKING THROUGH THIS- THIS STATEMENT FROM FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP- WE KNOW HE WAS PREPPED AND READY TO GO FOR THIS MOMENT. IT'S LIKE THE IS GETTING INTO SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE FACING HIM. WE HAVE SEEN IN THE PAST THAT HIS LEGAL ISSUES HAVE PROPELLED HIM INSIDE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, THAT THE PEOPLE WHO CONSIDER THEMSELVES CONSERVATIVES, WHO IDENTIFY AS REPUBLICAN, END UP BACKING HIM, REPUBLICAN END UP BACKING HIM. THEY FEEL MORE LITTLE TEAM, WITH LEGAL ISSUES COMING INTO PLAY. THERE'S A REAL OPEN QUESTION AS TO WHETHER THAT HOLDS IN A GENERAL ELECTION, PARTICULARLY WITH SOME OF THE MORE INDEPENDENT LEANING THE SUBURBAN WOMEN WHO HE WILL HAVE TO WIN OVER IN CRITICAL STATES LIKE GEORGIA, MICHIGAN, ETC. TO WIN THE PRESIDENCY >>. RIGHT AND WE WERE LOOKING AT A THREE MONTH TRIAL FOR THIS FEDERAL ELECTION INTERFERENCE CASE. THIS WOULD BE THREE MONTHS. DONALD TRUMP WOULD BE IN A COURTROOM IN WASHINGTON DC, WITH DAILY INFORMATION, EVIDENCE BEING BROUGHT BEFORE A JURY AND A CONSTANT FLOW OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE SERIOUS NATURE OF THE CHARGES AGAINST THE LIKELY REPUBLICAN NOMINEE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. NOW THIS CALLS INTO QUESTION WHETHER THIS TRIAL WILL EVEN TAKE PLACE BEFORE THE 2024 ELECTION. LET'S BE VERY, FRANK. THIS IS GOOD NEWS FOR DONALD TRUMP. HE HAS MADE IT CLEAR: HE DOESN'T BELIEVE THAT ANY OF THESE CHARGES SHOULD HAVE BEEN BROUGHT AGAINST HIM IN THE FIRST PLACE AND THAT THIS TRIAL SHOULD BE THROWN OUT IN AT ENTIRETY FOR DONALD TRUMP. IF, IN FACT, THIS TRIAL WILL NOT BEGIN UNTIL AFTER THE 2024 ELECTION AND HE WERE TO WIN THE WHITE HOUSE, YOU COULD SEE HIS DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THROUGHOUT THESE FEDERAL CHARGES AGAINST HIM. SO THIS DECISION BY THE SUPREME COURT TODAY HAS MAJOR REPERCUSSIONS FOR HIM, POLITICALLY AND LEGALLY. ONE OTHER NOTE: OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS YOU KNOW TO, DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN HIGHLY CRITICAL OF THE SUPREME COURT, INCLUDING AFTER THE 2020 ELECTION, FOR NOT HEARING HIS CHALLENGE TO THE 2020 ELECTION RESULTS. JUST IN THE LAST WEEK, DONALD TRUMP, AT A CAMPAIGN EVENT THAT I WAS AT, HE HERALDED THE THREE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES THAT HE NOMINATED AND THAT WERE ULTIMATELY PUT ON THE SUPREME COURT BENCH AS GREAT JUSTICES, COURT BENCH AS GREAT JUSTICES. NOW HE REALIZES MUCH OF HIS FEET LEGALLY COULD COME AT THE HANDS OF THIS SUPREME COURT THAT WILL HEAR THIS CASE ON APRIL 22nd. >>. VON HILLIARD, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT. LET ME BRING IN ONE OF OUR LEGAL ANALYST HERE FOR NBC NEWS. YOU HEARD VON DESCRIBED THIS AS A WIN FOR THE FORMER PRESIDENT AND HIS LEGAL TEAM, AT LEAST FOR NOW. IT DOESN'T MEAN IT WILL REMAIN A WIN. TALK US THROUGH THAT PIECE. >>. THAT'S TRUE. THERE'S ALSO SOMETHING I DO WANT TO BRING UP WHICH IS THAT EVEN THOUGH. OBVIOUSLY THIS IS CENTRAL TO THE DC CASE. THIS IS A DEFENSE THAT HE HAS ATTEMPTED TO PRINT UP ACROSS ALL OF HIS CASES, NOT JUST IN DC AND IN PARTICULAR WITH THE GEORGIA CASE AND ALSO IN FLORIDA. SO IT IS VERY POSSIBLE HE'S GOING TO RAISE THIS MOTION AGAIN IN BOTH OF THOSE TRIALS AND LOOK IN GEORGIA. WE SAW THERE WERE ALL THOSE FIREWORKS BUT THE QUESTIONS OF THE PROSECUTORS AND WHETHER OR NOT. THAT WOULD DELAY THE CASE. QUITE LOGICALLY THIS WOULD ALSO DELAY THE CASE BECAUSE PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY. IF IT WERE TO APPLY, WOULD APPLY ACROSS THE BOARD TO STATE AND FEDERAL TRIALS. NOW IN THIS CASE WE DO EXPECT- JUST TO ECHO EVERYBODY ELSE- THAT THE SUPREME COURT WILL LIKELY AFFIRM WHAT THE CIRCUIT OF APPEALS COURT TO DECIDE IN THAT THERE IS NO WAY THEY ARE GOING TO COME DOWN AND SAY TRUMP HAS TOTAL AMINAL IMMUNITY OR THAT ANY PRESIDENT OR ANY FEDERAL OFFICIAL DUNS HALLE >>. THANK YOU SO MUCH, ANGELA, FOR THAT A LOT TO JUGGLE TONIGHT. I APPRECIATE YOU BEING WITH US. ALSO A LOT TO JUGGLE IN WASHINGTON OUT OF THE CAPITOL, BECAUSE CONGRESS LATE TONIGHT IN JUST THE LAST HOUR HAS APPARENTLY AGREED TO A LITTLE PACKAGE THAT WILL STAVE OFF A PARTIAL GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN, AT LEAST FOR NOW. THAT MEANS THE DEADLINE NEXT FRIDAY, MARCH 8th. IT IS BASICALLY KICK THE CAN FOR A WEEK KIND OF A SITUATION TO SEE IF WE CAN FIGURE OUT SOMETHING MORE LONG-TERM. THAT WOULD AVOID THE PARTIAL SHUTDOWN OF SOME OF THE DEPARTMENTS YOU SEE HERE: AGRICULTURE, HOUSING, TRANSPORTATION. THEY ARE GIVING THEMSELVES ANOTHER THREE WEEKS TO DEAL WITH THE BIG ONES, WITH THE DEADLINE THERE MARCH 22nd FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, STATE DEPARTMENT, ETC. IN THE LAST HALF AN HOUR WE ARE GETTING A STATEMENT IN FROM THE WHITE HOUSE SAYING THAT A BIPARTISAN AGREEMENT WOULD PREVENT A NEEDLESS GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN, SAYING IT WOULD GIVE CONGRESS MORE TIME TO WORK ON THE SPENDING PACKAGES. RYAN NOBLES IS JOINING US NOW. IT'S INTERESTING RYAN. ON ONE HAND, IT IS SOMETHING WE HAVE SEEN FROM CONGRESS BEFORE KICK THE CAN, ILLITERATE TO TRY TO GET RESOLUTION. ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU ARE GETTING LIMITS OF OPTIMISM FROM SOME OF THESE LEADERS WHO THINK THAT HEY, THIS MIGHT JUST BUY THEM ENOUGH TIME TO GET TO SOMETHING MORE LONG-TERM >>. Reporter. THAT'S REALLY THE VIBE. WE ARE GETTING A PEER HALLE AS THE LAWMAKERS ARE IN WIDESPREAD AGREEMENT OVER BASICALLY THE BIGGEST CONTOURS OF THE SPENDING DEALS AND THEY JUST NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE. JUST NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME TO FORMALIZE THE LANGUAGE BEFORE THEY CAN GET IT INTO A PLACE WHERE IT CAN ACTUALLY BE VOTED ON. SO WHAT WE EXPECTED TO PLAY OUT HERE OVER THE NEXT 24 HOURS IS THAT THE HOUSE WILL GO FIRST. THEY WILL PASS A SHORT- TERM SPENDING BILL THAT WILL GIVE THEM UNTIL A WEEK FROM FRIDAY TO GET THE FIRST TRANCHE OF BILLS PASSED, THE ONES THAT YOU POINTED TO THE FDA TRANSPORTATION, VETERAN TRANSPORTATION, VETERAN AFFAIRS, THOSE DEPARTMENTS ABOUT A THIRD OF THE GOVERNMENT. THEN EXTEND THE SECOND TRANCHE OF THOSE, WHICH IS THE MORE COMPLICATED SPENDING PACKAGES THAT INVOLVE THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE THINGS, ALONG THOSE LINES ALL THE WAY TO THE BODY. SECOND, THERE IS A BELIEF THAT THEY ARE NARROWING IN ON THE THORNIEST ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN A HOLDUP FOR THEM UP INTO THAT POINT. THERE'S A BELIEF THEY CAN GET IT DONE BY THE 22nd. SO IT'S NOT AN EASY PROCESS. BY ANY MEANS. IT HAS TAKEN THEM A LONG TIME TO DO SOMETHING THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE BACK IN SEPTEMBER. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT: IF THEY DO GET THIS DONE ON THE 22nd, IT WILL ONLY ALLOW THEM TO GET SPENDING APPROVED THROUGH THIS COMING SEPTEMBER BUT THEN, IN TERMS OF CONGRESS, THIS IS A PRETTY BIG VICTORY >>, AND THE PLAN IS TO MAKE THIS YEAR RYAN FAIR TO SAY THEN THAT NOT ONLY DOES THIS KEEP THE GOVERNMENT OPEN FOR AT LEAST A LITTLE WHILE LONGER, BUT THAT THIS IS PERHAPS A WIN FOR THE HOUSE. SPEAKER IN WRANGLING WHAT CAN BE A CACOPHONOUS CONFERENCE, IF YOU WILL >>. Reporter. FIRST, WE HAVE TO SEE IT PASS. WE ARE NOT THERE, QUITE YET. AND WE HAVE TO SEE IF THERE IS ANY SORT OF. WE ALSO HAVE TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY AFTERMATH, AFTER IT DOES PASS. WE THINK, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES THERE'S GOING TO BE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICANS ONCE CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICANS ONCE WHO COULD PUT SPEAKER JOHNSON'S JOB ENDANGER THE MOST THAT WILL VOTE AGAINST THIS PACKAGE. THE QUESTION IS HOW MUCH THEY WILL BLAME SPEAKER JOHNSON FOR WORKING WITH DEMOCRATS TO GET THIS DONE. BUT THE SIMPLE FACT OF THE MATTER IS- AND IT SEEMS AS THOUGH SPEAKER JOHNSON SEEMS TO UNDERSTAND THIS- THERE ISN'T GOING TO BE A PERMIT FUNDING. IF THERE ISN'T A BILL THAT WAS REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS CAN AGREE UPON, HE HAS CHOSEN THE PATH OF GOVERNING. THIS TIME AROUND HALLE WILL HE CHOOSE THE PATH OF GOVERNING WHEN IT COMES WHETHER? BIG ISSUES THAT THE SUBMITTAL PACKAGE THAT WOULD PROVIDE FUNDING TO UKRAINE AND ISRAEL, THAT REMAINS AN OPEN QUESTION. ON THIS QUESTION RIGHT. NOW THE SPEAKER IS SUSAN GOVERNING AS OPPOSED TO PARTISAN POLITICS. >>. RYAN, NOBLES LIFE FOR US ON CAPITOL HILL. RYAN, THANK YOU. OF COURSE, THE CAPITOL A BUSY SPOT. TODAY, WE'VE ALSO LEARNED TONIGHT THAT THE LONGEST-SERVING SENATE LEADER IN HISTORY IS A STEPPING DOWN FROM THAT ROLE AND, IN DOING SO, MAKING CLEAR WHAT IS NOW A CENTRAL TRUTH OF THE MODERN REPUBLICAN PARTY- THE MODERN REPUBLICAN PARTY. IT IS MAGA TERRITORY. MITCH McCONNELL'S DEPARTURE AND LEADERSHIP IS THE NATURAL CONCLUSION FROM THIS YEAR'S LONG TRANSITION FROM A PARTY ONCE SOLIDLY UNDER MITCH McCONNELL'S >>> TO ONE THAT IS COMPLETELY CONTROLLED IN PRETTY MUCH EVERY WAY, SHAPE AND FORM, BY THE GUY YOU SEE ON THE LEFT OF YOUR SCREEN: FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, SENATOR MITCH McCONNELL ALLUDING TO THAT ON THE SENATE FLOOR TODAY, LISTEN >>. BELIEVE ME, I KNOW THE POLITICS WITHIN MY PARTY, AT POLITICS WITHIN MY PARTY AT THIS PARTICULAR MOMENT AND TIME. I HAVE MANY FAULTS. UNDERSTANDING POLITICS IS NOT ONE OF THEM. >>. MITCH McCONNELL MAKING LEAR: HE DOESN'T MISUNDERSTAND. THIS POLITICAL MOMENT IS ALSO MAKING CLEAR. EVEN THOUGH, HE WILL NOT BE THE SENATE REPUBLICAN LEADER AFTER NOVEMBER. HE'S STICKING AROUND AS JUST A REGULAR SENATOR, UNTIL HIS TERM ENDS THREE YEARS FROM NOW. THIS NEWS WHILE SURPRISING IN ITS TIMING. SURPRISING, IT IS COMING DOWN TODAY, NOT NECESSARILY SURPRISING. IN THE CONTENT, THERE HAVE BEEN SINCE REGULATION THAT THIS COULD HAPPEN, ESPECIALLY AFTER SOME QUESTIONS AROUND THE HEALTH OF THE 82-YEAR-OLD LIKE. AFTER HE FROZE UP IN FRONT OF REPORTERS LAST YEAR: >> ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT TO SAY? SAY, DO YOU WANT TO SAY ANYTHING? DO YOU WANT TO SAY ANYTHING ELSE, NOT JUST QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS HEALTH? >>. THERE HAVE BEEN QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS GRIP ON THE PARTY, ESPECIALLY AFTER. HE REFUSED TO GO ALONG WITH DONALD TRUMP'S ELECTION FRAUD LIES AND CRITICIZED THE FORMER PRESIDENT FOR HIS ROLE IN JANUARY 6th, WHICH KICKED OFF. WHAT IS NOW USE OF INSULTS FROM THE FORMER PRESIDENT, DIRECTED AT MITCH McCONNELL. DIRECTED AT MITCH McCONNELL'S WIFE, ACTED AT MITCH McCONNELL'S AGE. THE LIST GOES ON. >>. MITCH McCONNELL, THE OLD CROW, THE OLD BROKEN DOWN CROW. MITCH McCONNELL IS THE LEAST POPULAR POLITICIAN IN THE COUNTRY. ACCORDING TO, HE'S AN COUNTRY. ACCORDING TO, HE'S AN OLD BROKEN DOWN CROW. >>. JUST A SAMPLING FROM THE FORMER PRESIDENT. I WANT TO BRING IN OUR TEAM COVERING THIS. CHUCK TODD IS JOINING US AS WELL. YOU CAN'T TALK ABOUT MITCH McCONNELL'S DEPARTURE FROM LEADERSHIP WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT THE DONALD TRUMP OF IT ALL HERE. >>. Reporter. THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT HALLE. THIS IS A SEISMIC DEVELOPMENT DRIVEN BY A MIX OF POLITICAL AND PERSONAL CONSIDERATIONS. THE POLITICAL IS LARGELY. DONALD TRUMP RELATED MITCH McCONNELL'S ENTRANCE IN THE SENATE REPUBLICAN CONFERENCE. USED TO BE FORMIDABLE. HE USED TO BE ABLE TO CONVINCE PEOPLE OF BILLS. HE WANTED TO PASS AND MOVE THEM IN HIS DIRECTION. ALL DRAWING TOGETHER, DONALD TRUMP HAS DISRUPTED THAT OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. THE SENATE REPUBLICAN CAUCUS USED TO BE ONE OF THE FEW PARTS OF THE GOP THAT WASN'T TOTALLY UNDER TRUMP. THAT HAS CHANGED. WE SAW A STARK EXAMPLE OF THAT IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS WHEN MITCH McCONNELL STRUCK A DEAL TO AUTHORIZE UKRAINE AID AND HELPING BORDER SECURITY, WHICH TRUMP REJECTED AND JUST FOR MEMBERS OF THE REPUBLICAN CAUCUS SUPPORTED THAT RECOGNIZING. MITCH McCONNELL SAW THAT HIS DAYS WERE UP AND THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN NUMBERED WHETHER OR NOT. HE WANTED TO STICK AROUND. THEN THERE'S THE PERSONAL, THEN THERE'S THE PERSONAL. LET'S THROW A TIMELINE UP. IT GOES ALL THE WAY BACK TO 2003,, WHEN HE UNDERWENT A TRIPLE HEART BYPASS AUGUST 2019, HE FRACTURED HIS SHOULDER AFTER A FALL. THOSE ARE RELATIVELY ISOLATED INCIDENTS, BUT MORE RECENTLY THIS YEAR, HE WAS HOSPITALIZED WITH A CONCUSSION AND HAD TWO HIGH-PROFILE FREEZE UPS THAT WERE HIGHLY DISCUSSED IN THE CONFERENCE. HIS MEMBERS SAW THAT AND THERE WAS A LOT OF SPECULATION ABOUT HIS FUTURE. MITCH McCONNELL SAID IN HIS SPEECH THAT FOLLOWED FROM HIS UNDEFEATED AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF HIS OWN HEALTH >>. FOR THE TIME IS A SPECTER FOR US ALL. IT IS INTERESTING THE WAY HE HAS BEEN PRESENT IN WASHINGTON POLITICS FOR SO LONG. PRESIDENT BIDEN IS RESPONDING TO THIS. LET ME PLAY WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAD TO SAY: >> WE'VE HAD A GOOD RELATIONSHIP. >>. SOME PRAISE FROM THE PRESIDENT. THERE PERHAPS SOMETHING THAT IS DRIVING, WHAT YOU HEARD FORMER PRESIDENT TALK AT ABOUT WHICH IS THE DISPLEASURE OF SOME REPUBLICANS FOR WHICH McCONNELL. WHAT IS UP WITH THE RACE TO REPLACE THEM? WHO SEEMS TO BE HAVING THE POLE POSITION FOR THAT ONE? >>. PRAISE FROM THE PRESIDENT AS WELL AS FORMER SPEAKER, NANCY PELOSI, WHO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TALKED ABOUT MITCH McCONNELL'S PATRIOTISM, A MODICUM OF POSITIVE THINGS TO TALK ABOUT ON THAT FRONT. SHE HAD ALSO SERVED, AND LET HER CONFERENCE AND THE HOUSE DEMOCRATS FOR A VERY LONG TIME, THE RACE TO REPLACE McCONNELL. THE FRONT RUNNERS FOR THIS JOB ARE THREE: JOHN'S, JOHN SOON JOHN AND JOHN CORNYN. THESE ARE ALL CURRENT OR FORMER DEPUTIES TO MITCH McCONNELL. DEPUTIES TO MITCH McCONNELL. UNLESS THERE IS A WILD ACCEPTED SURPRISE OUT OF LEFT FIELD. IT WILL BE ONE OF THESE THREE MEN THAT TAKE MITCH McCONNELL'S JOB IN TERMS OF WHO HAS THE INSIDE LINE RIGHT. NOW, IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE THE JOCKEYING IT IS ABOUT TO CRANK UP IN A SIGNIFICANT WAY. THESE BATTLES ARE USUALLY RESOLVED WELL BEFORE THE ACTUAL ELECTION TAKES PLACE, WHICH WILL BE IN NOVEMBER >>. A LOT OF REPORTING TARGETS FOR YOU, CHUCK. LET ME GO TO YOU. IN HIS DECADES IN THE SENATE, MITCH McCONNELL HAS BEEN SEEN AT TIMES AS A HERO ON THE RIGHT, A VILLAIN ON THE LEFT, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT CAME TO THE REMAKING OF THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY, WHICH I MEAN LISTEN, HE WAS BEHIND. HE HELPED APPOINT 234 FEDERAL JUDGES SINCE 2015.. JUDGES SINCE 2015.. HE BLOCKED- I MEAN BLOCKING- PRESIDENT OBAMA'S PICK FOR A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE THAT WOULD HAVE TO THE SCALES IN A MORE LIBERAL DIRECTION, ONLY TO TURN AROUND AND GREEN LIGHT. THREE CONSERVATIVES ONTO THE COURT HELP FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP TO THAT, WHICH SOLIDIFIED THE RIGHT-LEANING MAJORITY WHICH ULTIMATELY LED TO THE OVERTURNING OF ROE VERSUS WADE, WHICH HAD BEEN A LONGTIME PARODY FOR REPUBLICANS. THERE IS A LEGACY FOR MITCH McCONNELL: THAT LIBERALS HATE BUT THAT CONSERVATIVES AT ONE POINT EMBRACED CHUCK >>. HE IS THE ARCHITECT OF THE COURT. HE IS THE ARCHITECT OF THE CURRENT CONSERVATIVE LIEN OF THE JUDICIARY BOTH IN THE SUPREME COURT AND, FRANKLY, ON ALL THE LEVELS, HE ESSENTIALLY OUTMANEUVERED, HE GOT HARRY REID TO CHANGE THE RULES FIRST, AND THEN HE CHANGED THEM. HE MADE PARTISAN AND ELIMINATED THE FILIBUSTER FOR JUDGES REALLY ALMOST GREEN LIGHT WHAT IS NOW AN IDEOLOGICALLY MORE DIVISIVE JUDICIARY IN GENERAL, I THINK UNFORTUNATELY, WHEN YOU GO TO 50 VOTES PLUS ONE, YOU ALMOST GUARANTEE THAT EVERYTHING, EVERYBODY THAT GETS THROUGH IF THEY DON'T MEET A FOOT FROM THE OTHER SIDE, IT IS GOING TO BE A VERY PARTISAN THING LOOK. I THINK HIS TWO MOST CONSEQUENTIAL DECISIONS ARE TO WE ARE STILL LIVING WITH TODAY. ONE IS WHAT HE DID WITH MERRICK GARLAND. THAT DECISION I MEAN. HE CREATED A PRECEDENT. HE SAT ON SOMETHING. HE FRANKLY POLYMERIZED THE COUNTRY MORE IN MANY WAYS. I THINK HE IN YOU KNOW HE WILL STAND BY WHAT HE DID FOR POLITICS. IT WAS A CONSEQUENTIAL DECISION AND IT PROBABLY YOU KNOW I WILL GO TO MY GRAVE BELIEVING- HAD TONIN SCALIA NEVER DIED. DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T WIN THESE PRESIDENCY. PRESIDENCY THAT OPEN SUPREME COURT SEAT WAS IMPORTANT TO SKEPTICAL CONSERVATIVES THAT DIDN'T LIKE TRUMP AT THE TIME, PARTICULARLY EVANGELICALS. THEN HIS DECISION NOT TO CONVICT DONALD TRUMP- I THINK MANY OF US BELIEVE THAT. HE HAS TO, AS HE HAS SEEN THIS PLAY OUT, AS HE HAS WATCHED. HE THOUGHT DONALD TRUMP WAS GOING AWAY. HE THOUGHT THE TRUMP ERA WAS OVER AND HE WANTED TO AVOID A PARTY FIGHT INTERNALLY. WELL, HE NEVER AVOIDED IT. NOW HE HAS JUST SURRENDERED IN SOME WAYS. THIS IS HIS IN SOME WAYS. THIS IS HIS ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY AND EVEN. I MEAN THE CLIP THAT HE MADE ABOUT THE CURRENT POLITICS. ANOTHER WAY TO LOOK AT IT: HE HAS SURRENDERED TO THE TRUMP WING AND THE LEADER OF THE NONETRUMP, WHEN, IS GONE AND RIGHT. NOW, THERE IS NO. WHO IS THAT LEADER? I GUESS IT IS NIKKI HALEY. RIGHT NOW. >>. WHAT IS SO INTERESTING? RIGHT HERE, CHUCK, EVEN THE POLLING, THE MAJORITY OF REPUBLICANS NOW DISAPPROVE OF MITCH McCONNELL, HIS OWN PARTY. RIGHT, IF THERE IS WRITING ON THE WALL, IT IS WRITTEN IN DONALD TRUMP'S SHARPIE. THAT IS JUST IT >>. 100% LOOK, FOR HE IN SOME WAYS. I KNOW THAT THERE WAS SOME. THERE HAS BEEN REPORTING THAT MITCH McCONNELL AND TRUMP ARE WORKING OUT AN ENDORSEMENT. I THINK THIS IS BETTER THAN ENDORSEMENT IF YOU ARE DONALD ENDORSEMENT. IF YOU ARE DONALD TRUMP, YOU GOT MITCH McCONNELL PROMISING THAT IF TRUMP IS ELECTED, HE'S NOT GOING TO BE THERE AND, ESSENTIALLY, TRUMP GETS TO PICK. IF TRUMP WINS THE PRESIDENCY HALLEY, HE WILL DECIDE THE NEXT SENATE REPUBLICAN LEADER IS. HE WILL HAVE A MUCH GREATER SAY. IF TRUMP DOESN'T, THEN IT IS A DIFFERENT CONTEST. SO YOU KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE FASCINATING TO WATCH THE LOW KEY JOCKEYING FRANKLY. I THINK ALL OF IT. THERE ARE SORT OF TWO SCENARIOS: A BITING WIND, I THINK, SENATE, REPUBLICAN. ONE DIRECTION- I THINK THAT'S GOOD NEWS FOR ALL OF THEM. A TRUMP WIN. IT COULD GO A WHOLE NUMBER OF WAYS HALLEY. I WILL TELL YOU WHERE IT WON'T. BE GOING TO JOHN. BE GOING TO JOHN >>. THE HEAD OF THE HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE SAYS HE'S READY TO MOVE TO A PUBLIC HEARING IN HIS IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY AGAINST PRESIDENT BIDEN. WE WILL KEEP AN EYE ON THE TIMING THERE AND BRING YOU ANY NEWS AS WE GET IT. >>>. LET'S TAKE YOU DOWN. SOUTH RIGHT NOW BURNING OUT OF CONTROL ACROSS TEXAS, THE SECOND BIGGEST WILDFIRE THE STATE HAS EVER SEEN. LOOK AT THAT. THESE ARE FIREFIGHTERS DRIVING RIGHT INTO THOSE FLAMES, THE RED SMOKE, THE BLACK SMOKE, FILLING UP THE SKY AROUND THEM AS THE SPARKS ARE FLYING PAST THEM. WE'VE GOT A STATE OF EMERGENCY RESOURCES THERE, WITH THE FIRE STRETCHING ACROSS 850,000 ACRES, BIGGER THAN THE WHOLE STATE OF RHODE ISLAND. LOOK AT THIS, THE FIRE JUST BURNING UP HOME AFTER HOME, THE FLAMES LEAVING, NOTHING BEHIND, EXCEPT FOR THE FRAMES OF CARS BURNT TO A CRISP. BASICALLY, PART OF WHAT IS FUELING THESE FIRES IS UNSEASONABLY HIGH TEMPERATURES EVEN AS IT IS SET TO GET DRAMATICALLY COLDER. TONIGHT, THE WEATHER ROLLER COASTER SETTING OFF INTENSE STORMS WHICH TRIGGERED NEARLY A DOZEN TORNADOES IN THE MIDWEST, SAM BROCK NOW WITH THE LATEST ON THE WILDFIRES >>. Reporter: HALLEY GOOD EVENING RIGHT NOW. TEXAS A AND M ON ITS STATE WEBSITE INDICATES FIVE ACTIVE FIRES GOING ON AT THIS MOMENT, AND THEY RANGE IN SCALE AND LEVEL OF CONTAINMENT, WITH THE LARGEST ONE OF COURSE, THE SMOKEHOUSE CREEK FIRE, 850,000 ACRES, ONLY 3% CONTAINED. THAT ALREADY PUTS IT ON THE STATE'S HISTORY BOOKS AS THE STATE'S HISTORY BOOKS, AS THE SECOND-LARGEST FIRE EVER AND LIKELY TO SURPASS NUMBER ONE. IT'S ONLY ABOUT 100,000 ACRES BEHIND. THIS IS ALL GOING ON IN THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS IN FEBRUARY. MANY PEOPLE WONDERING. IS THAT NORMAL FOR THE STATE OF TEXAS? THE ANSWER IS TYPICALLY A FIRE. SEASON IS MARCH AND APRIL. WE ARE SEEING IT EARLIER. WE HAD A RECORD SHATTERING TEMPERATURES THROUGHOUT THIS WEEK: DALLAS, FOR EXAMPLE. SOME 94 DEGREES ONLY A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO IN FEBRUARY. COMBINE THAT WITH DRY CONDITIONS AND WIND SPEEDS. 50 TO 60 MILES PER HOUR GUSTS IN THE LAST 48 HOURS. THIS HAS BEEN DEEPLY PROBLEMATIC. THE GOOD NEWS IS RIGHT NOW, AS WE HEAR FROM AUTHORITIES, FROM AMARILLO OUT OF THERE ON THE PANHANDLE TO OTHER PLACES LIKE HUTCHINSON COUNTY. THE WIND SPEEDS ARE NOW AT ABOUT 5 TO 10 MILES PER HOUR. THAT'S GOOD FOR FIREFIGHTING. IT HELPS THEM, AS THE FLAMES HAVE SUFFOCATED SO MANY SMALL TOWNS. AMARILLO IS THE BIG CITY, A COUPLE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE. SOME OF THESE OTHER PLACES, WHETHER IT IS BORGER OR FRIDGE, HAS BETWEEN 2000 AND 10,000 FOLKS, WHEN YOU HEAR ABOUT DOZENS OF HOMES BEING LOST BUT STILL A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE POPULATION, POPULATION IN FACT. IN WANABANA, THEY ARE BEING TOLD TO BOIL THEIR WATER AND THEY CAN'T, BECAUSE THERE'S NO ACTIVE WATER. AUTHORITIES ARE DOING THEIR BEST THEY CAN TO PULL RESOURCES FROM ALL OVER THE STATE, AS FAR AWAY AS FORT WORTH, TEXAS, AMARILLO, CERTAINLY A THREE- HOUR DRIVE. THE LAST WE HEARD FROM HUTCHINSON COUNTY, EMERGENCY OPERATION OFFICIALS, WAS THAT THE STATE WAS GETTING THOSE AERIAL DROPS IN PEOPLE WITHIN THE VICINITY OF THE FLAMES TO TRY TO DOUSE THEM. BUT CONTAINMENT, 3% ON THE SYSTEM WORK AND WHAT COULD BE THE LARGEST FIRE DETECTIVES HAVE EVER SEEN. THANKFULLY NO REPORTS OF SERIOUS INJURIES OR FATALITIES. YET OBVIOUSLY THAT COULD CHANGE. LASTLY, I WILL LEAVE YOU WITH THIS. THERE IS AN ATOMIC PLANT THAT SYMBOLS AND DISASSEMBLES ATOMIC BOMBS, THE MAIN ONE IN THE UNITED STATES, AND WE ARE TOLD THAT IT IS NOT IN DANGER. AT NO POINT. WAS IT IN DANGER, ALTHOUGH THERE HAD TO BE PREPARATIONS IN CASE. THE WORST SITUATION DID EVOLVE. THINK OF IT. IT DID NOT. >>>. COMING UP ON THE SHOW, NEW ACCOMMODATIONS FROM THE CDC TODAY OVER SPRING COVID-19 BOOSTERS WHO THEY SAY SHOULD GET ONE >>>. PLUS WHAT IS GETTING EVEN MORE EXTENSIVE AT DISNEY WORLD >>>. A NEW PLAN OUT TODAY WOULD >>>. A NEW PLAN OUT TODAY WOULD MAKE DOMESTIC ABUSE. LAWS APPLY TO CARMAKERS TO TRY TO GET AHEAD OF SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT CONNECTED CARS OR CARS THAT CONNECT TO THE INTERNET COULD ENABLE STALKING BECAUSE OF FEATURES LIKE THE ABILITY TO TRACK YOUR CAR OR TURN YOUR CAR ON OR OFF REMOTELY. THE FTC MAKING THE CASE FOR THESE RULES >>. Reporter, NEW SOPHISTICATED FEATURES IN THE AUTO INDUSTRY, LIKE LOCATION, TRACKING AND THE ABILITY TO CONTROL YOUR CAR REMOTELY, WERE INTENDED TO BE A SELLING POINT FOR CONSUMERS, BUT NOW CONCERNS THE TECHNOLOGY PUTS LIVES IN DANGER. >>. MANY OF US STEP IN OUR CARS EVERY DAY AND DON'T REALLY REALIZE HOW THAT TECHNOLOGY COULD BE USED AGAINST US. >>. THE FTC STEPPING INTO COMBAT CASES OF TECHNOLOGY ENABLED STOCKING THEIR HIGH-TECH TOOLS WERE USED AGAINST DOMESTIC ABUSE VICTIMS >>. WE HEAR FROM SURVIVORS EVERY SINGLE DAY WHO ARE EXPERIENCING WHAT WE CALL TECHNOLOGY FACILITATED ABUSE, WHICH IS ABUSE. THAT IS, ANY FORM OF TECHNOLOGY THAT IS BEING USED TO CARRY OUT THAT CONTROL AND HARASSMENT >>. Reporter.

SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC ABUSE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN GIVING UP THEIR VEHICLE AND FEELING SAFE. >>. THE FTC STEPPING INTO MAKE A DATE BECAUSE THE AUTOMAKERS DIDN'T PUT ENOUGH PRIVACY PROTECTIONS IN PLACE AS IT IS >>. ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS THAT THE PRIVACY PROTECTIONS THAT ARE IN PLACE ARE DESIGNED AGAINST THIRD PARTIES. THE NATURE OF THE THREATS ARE CHANGING ALL THE TIME. ONE OF THE THINGS THE CARMAKERS DIDN'T THINK ABOUT IS PROTECTING INFORMATION FROM PROTECTING INFORMATION FROM OTHER MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY FROM OTHER OWNERS OF THE CAR >>. Reporter. THE CALL FOR REGULATION DRIVEN BY MEDIA REPORTS LIKE THESE. IN ONE CASE, A WOMAN UNSUCCESSFULLY SUED TESLA, ALLEGING THE COMPANY NEGLIGENTLY FAILED TO HELP HER, CLAIMING HER HUSBAND WAS STALKING AND HARASSING HER TO THE VEHICLE, SINCE HE WAS THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE ACCOUNT. ACCORDING TO THE LAWSUIT, SHE SAID, SHE DISCOVERED HER CAR WAS OPEN, THE SETTINGS CHANGED OR THE VEHICLE'S ABILITY TO CHARGE TURNED OFF. THE WOMAN AND HER HUSBAND ULTIMATELY SETTLED THE SUIT >> THE SCENARIOS THAT A SURVIVOR COULD BE LEAVING THEIR ABUSIVE PARTNER AND TRYING TO ENTER SAFETY SUCH AS EMERGENCY SHELTER AND THAT, THAT VERY VEHICLE THEY ARE DRIVING TO THE SHELTER TO CAN BE TRACKED, IS DEEPLY CONCERNING. WHEN YOU HAVE THE CONCEPT, WHEN YOU ARE DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGY, IT IS REALLY CRITICAL TO THINK ABOUT HOW THAT CAN BE MISUSED AND MITIGATE THAT BEFORE IT EVER REACHES THE MARKETPLACE >>. Reporter. THE FTC POINTS TO THE FEDERAL SAFE CONNECTIONS ACT AS A PRESIDENT WHICH GIVES THE AGENCY AUTHORITY TO HELP DOMESTIC ABUSE SURVIVORS TO COMMUNICATE REQUIRING TELECOM PROVIDERS TO SEPARATE PHONE LINES ON A FAMILY PLAN IF THE ABUSER IS ALSO ON THE ACCOUNT. >>. MORA, THE FTC TYPICALLY REGULATES STUFF LIKE TV RADIO. REGULATES STUFF LIKE TV RADIO. BUT IT IS NO PROPOSAL, IS KIND OF SOME NEW TERRITORY CARMAKERS. WHAT ARE THE CAR COMPANIES ARE SAYING ABOUT THE SENATE? >>. WE REACHED OUT TO SEVERAL DIFFERENT CARMAKERS THAT HAVE THIS CONDUCTIVITY ABILITY AND THE ONE THING WE HEARD BACK FROM TOYOTA WAS THEY HAD NOTHING ELSE TO ADD BUT WE DID GET A PREVIEW OF HOW SOME OF THESE AUTOMAKERS MIGHT BE REACTING, BECAUSE THE FTC CHAIR WOMAN ASKED THEM WHAT PRIVACY PROTECTIONS THEY ARE READY TO HAVE IN PLACE WHEN IT COMES TO A DOMESTIC ABUSE SURVIVOR. TESLA DODGED THE QUESTION, CITING WAYS: THEY HAVE PRIVACY LAID OUT TO PREVENT FROM HACKERS HACKERS. BUT TOYOTA ACTUALLY SAID THAT IF THERE WAS A CASE IN WHICH SOMEONE CAME TO THEM AND SAID: I WANT YOU TO DISCONNECT MY FORMER FAMILY MEMBER OR MY EX- HUSBAND OR WHATEVER THE SITUATION, BECAUSE OF CONCERNS ABOUT DOMESTIC ABUSE, THEY SAID THEY WOULD LOOK FOR CORROBORATION FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT. THE FCC, ACROSS THE BOARD, IS TRYING TO REGULATE THIS TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A PROCESS IN PLACE IF SOMEONE NEEDS TO HAVE SOME SORT OF DISCONNECTION IN THAT WAY, IN TERMS OF WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT, THE FCC JUST PROPOSED THIS NEW RULE TODAY AND WHERE THEIR PROCESS WORKS IS THEY ARE GOING TO LEAVE IT OPEN FOR PUBLIC COMMENT AND CONVERSATION. MAKE SURE THEY ARE CONSIDERING ALL OF THE NECESSARY THINGS THEY MIGHT NEED TO ADD TO THE RULE IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS AND THAT WAY THE COMMISSION WILL CONSIDER IT, VOTE ON IT AS A BOARD AND THAT IS WHEN IT WOULD PASS AS REGULATION WOULD APPLY FOR THESE AUTO MAKERS HALLEY >>.

MONTHS AFTER WANABANA RECALLED IT'S CINNAMON APPLESAUCE POUCHES BECAUSE OF HIGH LEAD LEVELS. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT PARENTS LIKE THIS ONE, ALYSSA MAGNUSON, HER 18 MONTH OLD STEVIE. ALYSSA SAYS STEVIE HAS HIGH LEAD LEVELS IN HER BLOOD. AFTER EATING THE APPLESAUCE SHE TELLS OUR TEAM. HOW GUILTY SHE FEELS. NOW MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ARE PAYING. ATTENTION HERE, SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR REGARDING HER PUSH FOR THE FDA TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT HEAVY METALS IN FOODS FOR KIDS LISTEN >>. YOU THINK YOU ARE SAFE WHEN YOU USE A CINNAMON FLAVORED APPLESAUCE PACK AND IT TURNS OUT. YOU ARE BASICALLY HAVING YOUR CHILD REASON. THE ITEMS HAVE BEEN RECALLED BUT PEOPLE STILL HAVE THINGS IN THEIR CUPBOARDS. THE NUMBER ONE GOAL HERE IS TO MAKE SURE IT IS ALL OUT OF THE COMMERCE SYSTEM >>. MARTHA LOVELESS IS JOINING. >>. MARTHA LOVELESS IS JOINING US. BEHIND THE STORY ON NBCNEWSCOM. THERE'S NO AMOUNT OF LETTER THAT IS SAFE FOR ANYBODY, ESPECIALLY FOR THESE LITTLE KIDS. WHAT IS SO SCARY FOR SOME OF THESE PARENTS WHO TALKED TO US IS THAT IT COULD LITERALLY BE YEARS BEFORE THEY EVEN HAVE A SENSE OF WHETHER THERE WERE DEVELOPMENTAL ISSUES, WHETHER THEIR KIDS HAVE LONG-TERM IMPACTS FROM HAVING THESE POUCHES POUCHES >>. THERE IS A LOT OF FEAR AND A LOT OF GUILT FROM PARENTS. I SPOKE TO FIVE FAMILIES AND ONE OF THE MOMS TOLD ME THAT HER CHILD HAD A BLOOD LEAD LEVEL OF 24 MICROGRAMS PER DECILITER. TO PUT THAT INTO CONTEXT, THE CDC CONSIDERS A NORMAL OR TYPICAL LEVEL TO BE 3.5 MICROGRAMS OR LOWER. SHE FEELS AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF GUILT ABOUT THE SITUATION SHE IS IN. ANOTHER PARENT TOLD ME THAT DOCKERS HAD INFORMED HER HER CHILD MAY HAVE A SPEECH DELAY, WHICH IS A POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECT OF LEAD EXPOSURE. ANOTHER PARENT TOLD ME THAT HER SON DEVELOPED DARK CIRCLES AROUND HIS EYES, THAT WON'T GO AWAY AND THAT HE JUST OVERALL LOOKS SICK. >>. IT'S SO HORRIFYING TO HEAR ABOUT. SOME OF THE GUILT OF THESE PARENTS FEEL LIKE THE ONE, MOM, WHO TOLD YOU I WAS SHOPPING AT THE DOLLAR STORE, JUST TRYING TO BE ABLE TO FEED MY FAMILY HERE AND GET THESE POUCHES I THOUGHT WERE GOOD FOR MY KIDS. >>. WANABANA HASN'T RELEASED A STATEMENT YET BUT THEY ARE WORKING WITH THE FDA ON ITS INVESTIGATION. THEY HAVE ALSO ANNOUNCED THEY ARE GOING TO REIMBURSE FOR SOME OF THE HEALTH CARE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE APPLESAUCE RECALL. BUT FAMILIES DO WANT A LOT MORE. THERE ARE A HANDFUL OF LAWSUITS AGAINST THE COMPANY FOR THE RECALL. >>. YOU HEARD SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR, KLOBUCHAR. WHAT CAN THE FDA DO TO BE MORE PROTECTIVE FOR CONSUMERS, FOR KIDS AND FAMILIES IN THIS INSTANCE? >>. A LOT OF THE FOCUS HAS BEEN ON THE FDA. THE FDA CURRENTLY DOES NOT SET LIMITS ON LEAD IN BABY FOOD. THEY DID RELEASE DRAFT GUIDANCE LAST YEAR BUT THOSE HAVE YET TO BE FINALIZED. THE FDA ALSO SAYS THIS IS A DIFFERENT SITUATION. THIS MAY BE A CASE OF FOOD FRAUD. THIS MAY BE A SITUATION WHERE YOU NEED TO GET TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE INVOLVED, OR CONGRESS NEEDS TO PASS A LAW, WHERE THEY RESTRICT CERTAIN IMPORTS OF FOOD FOR KIDS OR BABIES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. BUT AMY KLOBUCHAR HAD ANOTHER COMMENT ON THAT AS WELL. >>. WHEN IT COMES TO WHO IS ACCOUNTABLE, GOING FORWARD, OUR LAWS HAVE TO CHANGE. SO THE FDA. WE HAVE A GOVERNMENT AGENCY. WE HAVE A GOVERNMENT AGENCY THAT DOES NEED TO SAY TRUST ME. AN AGENCY THAT SAYS: YOU NEED TO MEET THE STANDARDS AND THEY ARE ENFORCEABLE AND YOU HAVE TO SHOW US YOUR REPORTS AND YOUR INSPECTION BEFORE WE LET YOUR PRODUCTS AND OUR COUNTRY >>. SO SHE WOULDN'T SAY WHEN, BUT SHE SAID SHE IS PLANNING TO INTRODUCE NEW LEGISLATION SOON. INTRODUCE NEW LEGISLATION SOON. TO DIRECTLY TARGET AGAINST THIS APPLESAUCE RECALL. >> THESE PARENTS.

Good evening Tonight. the fate of former President Trump's Georgia election interference case in the hands of a judge. that judge debating whether to remove Fulton County DA Fani Willis from the case over allegations she financially benefited from a relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Weight. Lawyers for Trump and his co-defendants arguing Willis should be disqualified due to the appearance of a conflict of interest. The judge raising questions about text messages. The defense claims prove waiting Willis live on the stand about when the relationship began, Well as making a surprise appearance in the courtroom- See or hear- right before her attorney argued her innocence for Laura to 9. claims of the to line Their testimony insisting Willis was targeted in the motion should be dismissed And this moment getting a lot of attention today, in the middle of her lawyers closing arguments. Let's walked up to him past the post It note. But the big mystery tonight: what did it say? The stakes are high for this is removed. Her entire office would be disqualified, potentially a pending the case against the former president. NBC's Marissa Parra breaks down all the key courtroom moments and a timeline for when the judge could make a ruling. >> Tonight, explosive closing arguments in a Georgia courtroom. Prosecutors don't act like this. Lawyers don't act like this. These people, your honor, is a systematic misconduct and they need to go as lawyers seeking to disqualify Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis from the Trump election interference case over what they say was an inappropriate relationship she had with the special prosecutor Nathan Wade. >> This office is a global laughing stock because of their contract. >>. Lawyers for Trump and other co-defendants arguing the romantic relationship between Willis and Wade created conflicts of interest, particularly financially, Mister Wade, And this will is basically lived Robin Leach's lifestyle of the rich and famous, and they did this riding on the backs of the defendants in this case, funded by the taxpayers of Fulton County in the state of Georgia. The defense pledging these comments Willis made at the oldest African American Church in Atlanta in January, Her first public comments on the scandal for a violation of professional rules of conduct. hey, I'm all saying how, only right and and when, when >> Defense today, claiming her words and timing are calculated >>. She chose to deflect and to do 2 things that are with free and simple for any lawyer, But particularly for prosecutor. She chose to pull out the race card in the God card. >>. Judge McAfee at one point questioning: if Willis is disqualified from this case, will she need to be removed from all others? Where would be the limiting? >> Principal, the district attorney signs every indictment assigned to this court room. Yeah, she's off every case. No, it would be when that if I found that she's untruthful, is that what you're? >> kind of suggest? >>. The defense team doubling down on their argument that Willis and Wade lied about their relationship, highlighting the sheer magnitude of Texan calls between them before they say their relationship started >> Just in the first 11 months of 2021, over 2000 calls, almost 9800 tax. Yeah, I don't even think love-struck teenagers communicate that much. Also, calling into question the timing of these communications: phone call from this, Well as between the swell sinister way 11: 32. that night Shortly after midnight the fun starts. traveling down was where Mister Wade lives, ends up where MS Willis is staying and he's there until roughly 04:55AM. teenagers have a name for those kind of calls and he's kind of space. I won't go into it. >>. Wilson's attorney arguing the technology used to pinpoint wait location is and always reliable and doesn't mean he was at. Willis is home. these records over that, The latest anywhere, reiterating their argument The Willis has been targeted by people who have an axe to grind against her and that the motion should be dismissed. Fani Willis entering the courtroom to listen in on the state's closing arguments, sitting just 3 seats away from Nathan Wade. Willis at one point even passing her attorney- A post it note, not speaking today, The remaining defiant after she took the stand 2 weeks ago. >> I think I'm on trial. These people are on trial for trying to steal an election in 2020.. I'm not on trial, No matter how hard you try to put me on trial. >>. A big part of the defense's argument: Text messages between Terrence Bradley, the former law partner of special Prosecutor Nathan Wade, and Defense Attorney Ashleigh Merchant. These messages, first published by the Megan Kelly podcast, appear to show urgent asking: Do you think it started before she hired him, to which she responded: Absolutely. It started when she left the DA's office and was a judge in South Fulton, Bradley, taking the stand earlier this week. at one point was asked about that very text. I was speculating. >>. Why would you speculate when she was asking you a direct question about when the relationship started? I have no answer for that, Except the fact that you do in fact know when it started and you don't want to testify to that. >>. In court, the judge today questioning if that discrepancy was really a slam dunk for Trump's lawyers. Is it ever definitively shown? >>. We knew this and that he actually did know it. other then just assertion: outright, Absolutely. Usually if a state as a witness to go sideways, they've gotten locked in. They sat down with a detective, got a full statement. We don't have that here. >>. Willis's attorney arguing tonight. the other side failed to prove the conflicts of interest casting doubt on claims. Willis are weighed have benefited financially from the case, The state of the DoubleTree and that the double tree- I don't know that to be a a lavish hotel. >>. All right, We saw and heard a lot in court today. The only thing we didn't get was a decision from the judge. Marissa Parra joins us now live from Atlanta, So that's the big question We're so: when will we know the decision? >>. Tom, was you mentioned yourself? There is a lot at stake here When it comes to that decision. The judge said at the very end there that there's a lot of legal issues that need analyzing. He said he needs time and that we should expect to hear from him sometime in the next 2 weeks with top. The big question is: will sometime in the next 2 weeks, The judge say he needs more information, more evidence, or will he say he has all the information he needs and will hear a decision and we'll finally get an answer on whether or not sine Willis and our entire team will stay on this case, Tom? >>. All right, Marissa, par for us following all the developments from court. Marisa, thank you to help us break down the legal ramifications of this case. I'm joined now by NBC News legal analyst Angela sun Adela and former federal prosecutor timid I a gun, The Williams. Thank you both for being here on top story at 10.. I'm going to start with you, since you that you the new person here on on our panel. who you think won today? who did better? Which side did better? >>. I'm, in fact, I think we all lost a bit, But I think, if I had, you know, I think they both performed based on the goals they had. with I'm looking at the defense. What they want to do was to create a circus, which is what they did. They talked about everything from race to God to you know kind of the days of our lives story, Oh Lord story. And what the prosecutors really focused on was: here's the law, Is there a financial conflict of interest? They wanted the judge to narrow down to something more specific and get away from weather or a relationship was occurring, Get away from whether they were in love or not, are dating. but asked the more narrow question: I think an effort. I think the prosecution had the edge of the- I don't know that they got over the line And what's most important is because that defense has the burden here And I think that's how I would >>. I mean, yeah, out there, and it could be a little confusing for viewers because we're talking about the prosecutors, the state and the lawyers for the co-defendants it for for the purpose of this argument, The judge was asking a lot of questions when he was asking the questions right to the people who are looking to throw funny Willis off this case. Could you pull anything from the judge's questions and and did did lead you to believe once I was doing better than the other? >>. Yes, so look, I actually thought the defense did a better job. if you're trying to look at who did a better job on the state today, But in terms of you say, at the fence, we're talking about the actual defense, actually defense attorneys, Trump's attorney, Mister Merchant- But in terms of the legal standard and where the judge was leaning, I think it's towards the prosecution. And that's because it was asked questions like: look, even if these people were lying, is that for me to judge? is that for me DQ them or is that for the bar association to? and admonished them So >>. He almost made it clear to me that he was going to the prosecution. So on that issue, the issue of Terrence Bradley, who was sort of the key witness right for the people looking to get Fani Willis off this case, He's the different divorce attorney who in the Texas just said absolutely there was a relationship before Nathan Wade started with the DA's office. How was an attorney. Can you prove that? Okay, He wasn't lying when he texted, but now he's lying on the stand when he said he can't recall when the relationship started. you actually can, And so that's the thing. I think. Terrence Bradley may Terrence Bradley look bad, but he didn't necessarily move the needle for the prosecution or the defense. That's my thing, Even with those text messages- And there are so many text messages between him and Ashleigh Merchant run. But he never proved that when he said those who was telling the truth then. so he just looks overall suspicious. Tim, another part of the of that, of that: the lawyers that were trying to toss funny Well, as from this case, part of their strategy was to hone in on on her message at that church in Atlanta. Let's play a piece of that right now. First thing, they say: >> So what was wrong with what her statements and in the church? So think the argument that the defense is making is that she was suggesting a racist intent by those who are seeking to disqualify her, challenging her appointment of Mister Wade, And if you are a jury, which right has not been selected yet, you might be taking that information, be biased against the defendants because you're now thinking these guys are racist and therefore can they get a fair trial? and Fulton County- I think that's what they're really the argument was centered on- was part of it. Also, though, that they're saying, listen, you're the DA for Fulton County. >> You were playing the race card when you knew that you want a relationship with this other prosecutor. So instead of saying yes, there was a relationship there, smoke there, You played the race card and you didn't. historically, black church that has such a big importance of that community in Atlanta >>. Well, I know ID will us did not deny that there was a way to ship, which was in the church. I don't think anything she said was factually inconsistent with her position. She actually did not say, as you can deny, was shipped from the beginning. So I don't know that they get there with that argument. But, frankly, you know we have to member day will us and all many Diaz across the country are elected officials. There simply are not bureaucrats. I think there is a component to that job that is speaking out, That is, being a member of the community, And that is putting forth that you know kind of argument of self out there. funny. Well, as his team was arguing that, listen, the cell phone data? >>. It doesn't prove exactly anything. all the money that was exchanged, Hey, she paid it back, But there were no receipts, right. So they they were. they were saying that the other side said: listen, when finally, wills is prosecuting criminals, she's using cell phone data and money-laundering cases, If there's no financial receipts you're going to prison. So did that hold up for the defensive side? >>. So that was a great argument, But I don't really think that's a legal issue that will make the judge decide And that ultimately, if this were a jury trial, these arguments made today would have swayed the jury, incredibly. But the judge is going to stick to the legal question And really the biggest legal question is: is the standard just him, parents of him, Friday, impropriety of a conflict of interest or actual conflict of interest? to the defense attorneys say: it's just the appearance. That's enough to disqualify them. >>. The prosecutors say: no, has to be an actual conflict of interest. him, You've grilled witnesses on the stand. Do you think the people here rely Nathan Wade, Fani, Willis, Terrence, where they, where they all lined, You think it was a- I don't know that the words conspiracy, but you think that we're not telling the truth? >>. His route say. but I look at Mister Bradley today, He was under oath, Those messages that that he, that came into evidence he wasn't under oath, That right So and he had an incentive. So what I, what I and cross examine a witness, what a motion to bring out is by us. or the incentive to lie. I look at Mister Bradley and I think they did show evidence that he was a disgruntled employee, that he had reason to basically coordinate with defense lawyer Ms Merchant And that's why he would have been lying to her. When I look at the Wilson, Mister Wade, I would think about whether this cooperation to what they're saying, whether there's evidence that contradicts I don't know. the defense lawyers got there, They came and said we have cell phone data that shows Mister Wade was at Misrata, said this was his condo. But then we look at the testimony He says yeah, I went to a condo. They said we that 30 times and the judge himself pointed out: Well, Mister Waite said he was there at least 10 times. So I don't know that the evidence of parsing out slight difference of the testimony is going to get you all the way there to saying someone was untruthful on the stand. Do you find it strange that the biggest case of funny willis's life >> And she has sort of this, this problem, this relationship- is at this art all to you >>. I think it's. it's very bizarre. It is a massive, massive lapse in judgment. But at this point earlier we have to draw distinctions between ethical concerns, professional conduct concerns and whether or not this prosecution is on lawful. So what happens, Angela? how does judge rule? >>. I think the judge is going to keep them on the case. That is my best guess right now. I think he's going to say it has to be a real conflict of interest and perhaps it hasn't met that state m >>. I agree, I think he keeps them on the case in this case moves forward. All right To lawyers in the greens here. We appreciate you guys being on top story. Thank you for that. >>. Another major headline tonight: a potentially historic winter storm pummeling the West Coast. A rare blizzard descending on the region dumping feet of snow in the Sierras.

That moment is pass. Sometimes the flurries pick up, Sometimes they kind of speed down, But right now it is hitting is pretty consistently, Tom. >>. Okay, Steve Patterson, first, as the weather's picking up there, as we see there, for more on this historic storm and how high those snow totals could get, NBC News meteorologist Bill Karins joins us now to walk us through what you're watching. >>. We just had 152 mile per hour Wind gusts at about 8,000 foot elevation at Palisades, Tahoe, The ski resort in the weather center There were amazed that it's even still working. So that's the kind of winds we're getting at the highest of elevations. We've already had reports, many reports, of one to about 2 feet of snow. This is just kind of stage one of the storm. This won't end until Sunday morning. We think we're going to get about one to 2 feet tonight into tomorrow And then Saturday night into Sunday. Sunday morning probably another one to 2 feet in many areas And you can just see the storm just spinning here and all that moisture hits the mountains. It gets wrong out. It's getting colder in this region to the snow is getting fluffier. It's going to build a pirates going blow around more. So here's kind of the timing of this. as we go throughout the weekend, Notice this areas we're watching. You know this is manatee, Yosemite, all the way up to the Lake Tahoe area.

And the time we still have that huge fire concerns this weekend. red-flag warnings go from Nebraska all the way down to Texas. We're highly concerned this area tomorrow in Colorado to North Texas and the exact same spot that we still only have 15% containment on the Smokehouse Creek fire. This is that area. tomorrow, 40 mile per hour winds, Don't be surprised if you hear tomorrow The fire spread into Oklahoma >>. It's going to be a busy weekend for you and your team. All right, Bill, we thank you for that. We do want to move on to a daring rescue in Louisville Bridge where new video shows a truck dangling over the water with that driver Still inside, firefighter rep telling down to get her and bring her to safety. Jessie Kirsch has that story. >>. A stunning scene unfolding on a Louisville bridge: A firefighter urgently rappelling down to reach, or driver stranded side, This semi tractor trailer. as the truck's cab dangles above the water, First responders worried it could fall at any moment >>. This is very much a worst-case scenario, Kind of a crazy thing that you don't expect actually have to do until you show up >>. Officials say around 12:00PM the truck and 3 other vehicles were involved in a collision, The truck careening off the roadway >> With its female driver still in the cab. the fire department says she was shaken >> But still, talking with the rescue teams were very concerned with the stabilization there. to make sure that our people are safe. Obviously, we're willing to risk a lot to save a lot And so, yes, we will absolutely take that risk to get her out, Firefighter Bryce Card and went over the edge to make the rescue. >>. She was just praying, praying a lot. So up right where she was super calm, collected and help me, do I need to do to get heard? safety essentially, and it all worked out for the best and we'll go back to quarters and get right to it again if we have to >>. About 40 minutes after the daring rescue began, the driver was out of harm's way, was alert and was taken to the hospital with what police believe are non life-threatening injuries. Authorities say 2 people from one of the other vehicles involved do have injuries that appear to be life-threatening >>. Tonight police still have not said what caused the collision which led to this incident, But we are learning more about the semi truck. It features the logo of food service company Cisco, which says its trucks do not transport hazardous materials. top >>. Jesse Kirsch first tonight. Jesse, thank you for that. We want to turn now to a breaking development in the criminal case against New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez, A co defendant in the criminal corruption case against Menendez, pleading guilty and agreeing to cooperate with prosecutors. It comes as another tri-state area official New York City Mayor, Eric Adams is also increasingly legal scrutiny tonight after the FBI raided 2 homes owned by one of his top 8.. It comes amid an ongoing federal investigation to Adams political fundraising during his 2021 campaign. Let's get right over NBC News chief justice contributor Jonathan Deans. He's here in Studio Johnson. A lot going on in the tri-state. Let's start with Senator Bob Menendez says was a bombshell development. No, Hoosier Veltman. Today there are 3 businessman accused of paying bribes to the senator >> Through his wife. one of them flipped and pleaded guilty today and has agreed to cooperate fully against the senator. And during his a plea elocution today in federal court, he said: yes, I bought the senator and his wife a Mercedes and that in exchange, he says the senator tried to help an associate of his get out of a insurance fraud case. Those being prosecuted at the state level that he was counting on the senator's help in exchange for the Mercedes. course, the senator's wife deny any wrongdoing. They're vowing to fight the charges, But prosecutors plan to use this man on the stand to point the finger >> At the senator. according to what that man said in court. it sounds like a textbook bribery case or have to wait and see what happens. But a huge development there. We've been tracking what's been happening with Mayor Adams and his staff are another big development today, right, Right, So the FBI searched the 2 properties belonging to one of his type top aides >>. She's an Asian affairs liaison. The FBI seizing documents- All this part of a campaign fund-raising case- questions about her and whether she helped organize a camp, improper campaign Bundling straw donations, if you will. They're looking at that. That is in addition to a separate fund-raising investigation where they were looking into whether any foreign money from Turkey was bundled through a construction firm. And so again it's campaign fundraising around the senator, but 2 title mayor around the mayor. because we are on the mayor to investigations going on at the same time in fundraising and questions about: did the senator, did the mayor know? what did he know about any of the activities of his so far is not charges Phone was seized by the FBI. We we have reported that, yes, they are taking a hard look, But as of now, the investigation for now centers around him. to say on: have All right, Jonathan Dietz, always great to have you Here, is to you. We appreciate it, Thank you. Still ahead tonight, the urgent search for an apparent kidnapping victim in Arizona. >>. New video shows a woman you see or hear trying to run from a car. Was it a gas station? when a man is seen grabbing her by the neck and dragging her back to the vehicle. was 40's few? This will be a challenging case to crack to explain.

Just how long he'll spend behind bars. and a scary scene at a golf course in the Florida Keys. What we know what a small plane that crashed at a Florida golf course. You see it right here. Stay with us. >>. We're back now with details of a manhunt near Phoenix, Arizona Police looking for a man caught on camera shoving a woman into a car at a gas station. The shocking footage disturbing law enforcement and community members. Now the clock's ticking as police try to find that woman and her potential abductor. Ellison Barber reports. >>. Tonight in Buckeye, Arizona, a desperate search for a woman believed to be in the grips of a violent man. It's almost like a horror movie. A gray SUV speeds into a gas station. A man gets out of the driver's seat, A woman opens the door on the other side and tries to run towards the convenience store. The man grabs her, puts his arm around her neck, seeming to choke her as he drags her back into the car. Within 30 seconds They're gone. >>. We believe that the vehicles 2021.. 22, 23, Nissan Rogue- All we have as far as description of this male and females, what you're seeing in the video. we don't even know their ages at this point. >>. The video is from last Friday night at approximately 10:00PM local time, But police just released it. >>. Why did it take so long to get that surveillance video and released to the public? Certain things had to be done to make sure that we had all of the video that we can release to the public, something that people can see and determine. Is this a vehicle that they may have seen? now they're desperately trying to find the woman and the man. We have investigators looking for video from commercial surveillance systems that can help us get a better idea of where this vehicle blend, where it came from, And the clock is ticking. There are a lot of unknowns. Are they local? Are they from somewhere else, where they heading somewhere else. That's why we really need folks to recognize these individuals in the video, recognize this vehicle. >>. Give us a call. People want to try to develop this much as the cases you can to bring it to resolve, or at least a 10 to 5 persons or persons involved within the first 48 hours. >>. How difficult is it to track someone down and solve something like this? that help or gin Is it? given the time it is past, time is of the essence. >>. But if there's anyone have to have the eagle. maybe they seen this vehicle, seen these 2 individuals who may have been acting strangely in public. They need to notify the local authority because it best it's worth the investigation. We're in a very poor All of this is that the victim, in this case it was clear the abducted- cancel the wheel to try to get her back to safety. >>. If you have any information, no matter how small you think it is, police are asking you to call them. The number is on your screen. If you want to stay anonymous, they say you can send a tip online. That is also on your screen. They say they cannot solve this without more help from the public. >>. Tom. All right, Listen, we appreciate that When we come back, first responders causing another emergency here in New York. Surveillance video captures the moment A fire truck lost control, crashed right through a furniture store, Long Island, but officials say caused this frightening scene. All right, We're back down the top stories News for you, to begin with the latest on the death of Elijah McClain. for more, Aurora Colorado paramedic Peter Chuck, who neck, was sentenced to 5 years in prison for giving McLean a lethal dose ketamine on a confrontation with police in 2019. was found guilty in December of criminally negligent homicide, along with another paramedic, Jeremy Cooper.

This happened at the Ocean We've golf Club, Key Largo. One person was believed to be the pilot was airlifted to a nearby hospital. No one on the ground was hurt.

Body cam footage shows the moment that officer pulled the baby from the wreckage of a car near Tampa last month. He and he performed CPR until paramedics arrived. The officer says Little is on the road to recovery >>. All right Now to power in politics And Nikki Haley making some big news today and sitting down with Meet the Press moderator Kristen Welker. though Haley is far behind in the delegate count and struggling to explain the path to the nomination at this point, She still, according to her campaign, raising a lot of money. This is she's preparing for what could be her last stand on the biggest voting, none of the primary season. Super Tuesday to discuss it all and share some of her new reporting. Let's bring in Kristen Welker- Chris, great to see you on this Friday night. A lot of talk about, But first I know this was a wide ranging discussion you had with Nikki Haley. I want to talk about one moment where you asked Hailey about the former president and the possibility of a second Trump term. Let's take a listen. >>. Do you think Donald Trump would follow the Constitution if you are elected to a second term? I don't know, I don't. I don't know. I mean, you always want to thank someone, Well, but I don't know. You know when you, when you go in and you talk about revenge. when you go in, you talk about, you know, vindication. when you go in, you talk about what does that mean? Like I don't know what that means and only he can answer for that. What I can answer for is: I don't think there should ever be a president that's above the law. I don't think that there should ever be a president that has total immunity to do whatever they want to do. >>. Chris, and one thing is clear: she's not going down without a fight. >>. Tom, you're absolutely right. It is great to be with you on this Friday as well. I spoke with a defiant Nikki Haley. You heard it there in her answer: The fact that she is not backing away from a question like that I thought was notable. And look, I asked her what her path looks like at this point. If she doesn't win a state after Super Tuesday, does she have to drop out? Not prepared to say that Yet time, she said what she has to do on Super Tuesday is show that she still competitive. her campaign points to the fact that 11 of the states that are going to vote on Super Tuesday are either open or semi-open primary states, meaning that independence Democrats can vote for her as well, Typically voting blocks that have helped Haley, But obviously, Tom, that hasn't helped her win a state yet. She knows the math, She knows it's a pill And she really talks about this in the context of the Republican Party, that she is fighting for her vision of the Republican Party, And I think that's what's so striking about that sound there that you played when she effectively says she doesn't know if Donald Trump would follow the Constitution in his second term- particularly notable because, of course, she served as his former UN. >>. And, Chris, I do want to ask you about the money she keeps raising- And yes, the new numbers are from the campaign, you know, and we haven't been be able to verify them yet, but they're seeing the phrase millions and millions of dollars. What about an independent? run right If she has the cash and she has support from Republicans and a lot of moderates. I know she spoke about this today >>. She spoke about this today time and look, she is really brushing aside questions about whether she would run as a third-party candidate. She continues to insist she is running as a Republican. First, when we play you a little bit of what she told reporters on the trail today and do some analysis on the other side >>. So really tamping down any suspect ex speculation, I should say that she would run as a third-party candidate And, Tom, I have to tell you I asked her about this as well And she went even further. So we'll have that on Sunday. But again, her tone is notable because she's just gotten tougher in her tone in recent weeks. I also asked her if she thought the court cases should go to trial against former President Trump before Election Day, If he is in fact the nominee, and she said yes, she thinks all of the court cases should be dealt with. were talking about 4 different criminal indictments. She said the voters deserve that. I can tell you, spoken to a number of her supporters and they say, boy, she has gotten tough in these weeks leading up to Super Tuesday. They wish she had gotten this time the beginning of the race. They think it would have made a difference. will have to see what Super Tuesday looks like. Can she pick off a Washington DC of Massachusetts? that could potentially be a game changer. if on the other side of Super Tuesday she doesn't have a W under her belt, Tom, I think some of these donations could start to dry up, and that's when she starts to have the really complicated conversations. >>. Yeah, we'll probably have a good sense Wednesday morning. Kristen Welker, we look so forward to that interview. We appreciate you for being here. A top story. tonight You can see more of Christine's interview with Nikki Haley. She also speaks with Michigan Congresswoman Debbie Dingell this Sunday only on Meet the Press and make sure you join us on Super Tuesday. Look at this lineup. Special coverage begins at 05:00PM Eastern right here on NBC News. Now we're bringing you all the results. live on a critical night in this primary campaign. Okay, Coming up desperate for aid. Cuba making in on. >>. Weston to plea to the World Food Program to provide powdered milk for young children. Why. this request signals just how bad things are in Cuba, as the island faces a shortage of food, fuel and medical supplies, are reports street from Havana. next: >> All right, We're back now with the Americas in the worsening economic crisis in Cuba, for the first time, the communist government, asking for help from the UN, requesting the World Food Program, Send monthly shipments of powdered milk for children. Shortages of milk, medicine and fuel Take a toll on the island. just last month- Look at this- We covered here on tap story How Cubans are struggling to make ends meet, how the island continues to struggle with constant blackouts. This is our people are living over there and the severe fuel shortage is affecting them every single day. I want to get right over to Augusta, who joins us tonight from our Havana bureau, And I want to start with that request to the World Food Program. She was in such a tough spot. right now They don't even have powdered milk for their babies. >>. We'll keep in policy is that every child up to the age of 7 is supposed to have size, let's suppose- to receive a kilogram of powdered milk every month to help with nutrition, And that's one of the reasons why, little over a decade ago, UNICEF said that this island is the only country in Latin America and the Caribbean to have unlimited about time, according to them, surveyed nutrition. But given the depths of the huge economic crisis he has been going surface, many is now- it's hardly surprising about that- that that program is not about running into hiccups, And we've spoken to families this week saying many cases the Milk's just not arriving And when it is, it's arriving late. So in this context, Cuba has taken an unprecedented step. for the first time the island's history, this island that in previous times trumpeted achievements and having an eight-inch hunga, has made a request to the UN World Food Program to help it get milk to the islands children >>. And then- and you know I've spoken to Cubans on the island- I've heard from human to have traveled back and come back to the states And and they're saying that it's never been this bad. I mean, what are people telling you out there on the island, in the country? >>. Well, we're speaking on the very day that the ruling Communist Party has just quintupled, That's right, Increased by 5 times the amount they paid- the price of gasoline. I want to show you a clip of somebody that we met is about to buy, not who we We met, who'd been spending hours in a long line just trying to fill up with gasoline. >>. I think that my piece. would that be a lesson for me. >>. So you just imagine, Tom, at the effect of this on inflation. economists say that the Cuban government does have to reduce the subsidy is and for increased the price of things like few. But obviously these measures are on that front. The people are scared about the effects of no consolation in the wider economy. Just to give you an idea of how difficult things off of Cubans, almost anything you can think of. That's a easy to get in so many other countries Should rice beans site something to. It's so difficult and so very, very hard for the average Cuban who salary now expected on the Times's $16 a month, to get hold of sticky buns. A very, very wide about just how tough life for me. I'm just coming >>. This as the sun is setting there in Havana. We notice the darkness behind you and not a lot of lights on at night And we appreciate reporting. Thanks for being a top story tonight, The top stories global, watching another region of the world in critical need of aid. President Biden has announced the US will air dropped food into Gaza.

Mexico City's reservoirs hitting historically low levels this week, Officials using tanker trucks to supply its more than 21 million residents. But it isn't enough.

TAKE A LISTEN: >>. THE LAST ADMINISTRATION HAD POLICIES IN PLACE, WHILE SOME MAY NOT HAVE LIKED IT, THEY WORK AND THEY WERE EFFECTIVE FOR US AS BORDER PATROL AGENTS. THEY WENT AHEAD AND CHANGED EVERYTHING AND DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING IN PLACE TO HANDLE THE OVERFLOW, AND THAT'S WHERE WE ARE AT RIGHT NOW. >>. Reporter. NOW THERE'S ALSO FRUSTRATION, NOT JUST IN THE BORDER REGIONS BUT ALSO IN DEMOCRATIC CITIES WHERE OFTENTIMES- GOVERNOR ABBOTT, FOR EXAMPLE- THEY HAVE FLOWN AND BUST MIGRANTS TO THE CITIES THAT ARE NOW ALSO OVERWHELMED AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO HANDLE THIS HUMANELY. >>. FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID HE SPOKE WITH THE FAMILY OF RILEY, AND THAT'S THE UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA MEDICAL STUDENT WHO WAS KILLED ALLEGEDLY BY AN UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANT. I WANT TO PLAY THAT. >>. JOE BIDEN WILL NEVER SAY LAKEN RILEY'S NAME, BUT WE WILL SAY IT AND WE WILL REMEMBER. WE'RE NOT GOING TO FORGET HER. >>. AGAIN, HE SPOKE WITH HER FAMILY YESTERDAY. SHE, IN MANY WAYS, HAS BECOME A SYMBOL AFTER HER DEATH FOR SOME REPUBLICANS, WHILE PLACING THE BLAME ON DEMOCRATS. >>. THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT AND LOOK. FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS USED STORIES LIKE RILEY'S TO POINT THE FINGER AT PRESIDENT BIDEN. BUT I'VE GOT TO POINT OUT SOME REPORTING FROM THIS MORNING. THEY DID AN ANALYSIS OF WHAT TRUMP CALLS THIS MIGRANT CRIME WAVE, AND IT REALLY DOESN'T QUITE EXIST. THEY FOUND THAT IN STATES THAT HAVE TAKEN IN THE MOST MIGRANTS, CRIME HAS ACTUALLY DROPPED IN THOSE AREAS, SO DROPPED IN THOSE AREAS SO WHILE ANY LIFE LOST IS TRAGIC. THE BIG SORT OF SCARY PATTERN THAT TRUMP IS TRYING TO PAINT THE DATA DOESN'T NECESSARILY BEAR THAT OUT HALLIE, BEAR THAT OUT HALLIE >>. AMERICANS CARE- I MEAN AMERICANS REALLY CARE ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND THIS CUTS ACROSS THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM. MORE THAN 80% OF AMERICANS SAY ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION IS A BIG PROBLEM AND, FOR THE FIRST TIME, A MAJORITY OF THOSE POLLED BACK A BORDER WALL >> AND THE ELECTORATE WE'VE SEEN IN POLLING OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. IT HAS MOVED TO THE RIGHT AND WE ARE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT REPUBLICANS, WE'RE TALKING DEMOCRATS THAT HAVE STARTED TO REALLY CARE A LOT MORE ABOUT THIS ISSUE. AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP ONCE TO CAPITALIZE ON. HE'S SEEN THE SAME POLLING WE'VE SEEN, DESPITE THE FACT THAT HE WAS A MAJOR REASON WHY THAT HE WAS A MAJOR REASON WHY THE BORDER NEGOTIATION FAILED. HE IS STILL PULLING FAR AHEAD OF BIDEN WHEN IT COMES TO THE QUESTION OF WHO IS BETTER CAPABLE OF HANDLING THE BORDER. IT WAS PRESIDENT TRUMP, BY A LONG SHOT. REPUBLICANS. THEY ARE STILL LOOKING TO THAT PARTY AS THE BETTER PARTY ON THIS ISSUE. HALLIE? >> THANK YOU FOR BEING THERE. WE WILL TALK AGAIN. >>>. REMEMBER WHEN THE DEFENSE SECRETARY WAS TREATED FOR SECRETARY WAS TREATED FOR PROSTATE CANCER, HOSPITALIZED- NOBODY KNEW ABOUT IT FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS. LAWMAKERS WERE FURIOUS THEN AND ARE FURIOUS TODAY, PUSHING BACK ON THE SECRETARY. THIS HEARING GOT REAL SPICY LISTEN. >>. ARE YOU SURPRISED THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T CALL FOR YOUR RESIGNATION? I'M SURPRISED. >>. THE PRESIDENT HAS EXPRESSED FULL FAITH AND CONFIDENCE IN ME. >>. THE BIG ISSUE FOR ME IS EITHER THE PRESIDENT IS THAT ALOOF OR YOU ARE. IRRELEVANT WHICH ONE IS IT, MR SECRETARY? >> THE PRESIDENT WOULD GO THREE DAYS WITHOUT KNOWING THAT HIS SECRETARY OF DEFENSE IS NOT ON THE JOB. >>. IT'S NEITHER. THAT'S WHAT HE SAID. HE'S FACING QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS UNDISCLOSED ABSENCE. THEY COULD HAVE AFFECTED NATIONAL SECURITY. REMEMBER THAT WHITE HOUSE WAS. REMEMBER THAT WHITE HOUSE WAS TOLD THAT HE WAS HOSPITALIZED ON JANUARY FOURTH MAC BUT HE ACTUALLY WENT INTO THE HOSPITAL THREE DAYS EARLIER ON NEW YEAR'S DAY. OKAY, THIS IS THE HEARING. I FEEL LIKE THE SECOND. WE LEARNED ABOUT ALL THIS WITH LLOYD AUSTIN. THE QUESTION WAS WHEN THE HOUSE CALLED HIM IN. WE ARE GOING TO SEE FIREWORKS AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE SAW. WHAT COULD COME OF THIS >>. THE REALITY IS THERE WERE REPUBLICANS WERE CALLING FOR ACCOUNTABILITY BUT AT THIS POINT I DON'T SEE ANY SCENARIO IN WHICH THERE, ACTUALLY IS ACCOUNTABILITY THE ONLY THING THAT IS LEFT TO DO THE INSPECTOR GENERAL STILL DO. THE INSPECTOR GENERAL STILL HAS AN INVESTIGATION. THAT'S ONGOING BUT THAT'S NOT LIKELY TO YIELD ANY ACCOUNTABILITY EITHER. WHAT WE'VE SEEN THIS WEEK IS THE DOD RELEASED A SUMMARY OF THEIR CLASSIFIED REVIEW INTO THIS HOSPITALIZATION AND LOOKING AT THE PROCEDURES AND THE NOTIFICATIONS AT HOW THAT WAS HANDLED BY SECRETARY STAFF AND HOW IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN HANDLED, AND THERE'S NEW GUIDELINES AND POLICIES THAT WILL GO INTO PLACE. BUT WE KNOW VERY LITTLE MORE DETAIL ABOUT WHAT ACTUALLY OCCURRED ON JANUARY FIRST MAC, UNTIL WE WERE TOLD IN THE PRESS CORPS ON JANUARY FIFTH MAC AND REMEMBER IT WAS DAYS AFTER THAT WHEN WE FOUND OUT WHY HE WAS HOSPITALIZED OR THAT HE HAD BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH PROSTATE CANCER- CANCER. SO TODAY'S HEARING THOUGH DIDN'T LEARN NEW DETAIL ABOUT. DIDN'T LEARN NEW DETAIL ABOUT THE TIMELINE. BUT ONE THING I FOUND FASCINATING WAS FOR THE FIRST TIME WE HEARD SECRETARY AUSTIN SAY, ON AT LEAST TWO DIFFERENT OCCASIONS, THAT HE EXPECTED HIS STAFF WOULD HANDLE THE NOTIFICATIONS HE SAID HE BELIEVED HE WAS A PATIENT AND THAT HIS STAFF WOULD NOTIFY THE APPROPRIATE AGENCIES OF THE HOSPITALIZATION. HE EVEN POINTED OUT AT ONE POINT. HE DID NOT HAVE A PHONE BUT THAT BEING SAID, WE HEARD FROM HIM OVER AND OVER, THAT HE ASSUMES SPOTS, ABILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR BEING THE HEAD OF THE PENTAGON >>. YOU HEARD IN THE LINE OF QUESTIONING COULD, HIS ABSENCE HAVE AFFECTED THE CHAIN OF COMMAND. THE ISSUES THAT THE HAS TO DEAL WITH ALL THE TIME- LET ME PLAY THAT >>. WE WERE DOING EVERYTHING WE NEEDED TO DO TO MEET THE NATIONAL SECURITY NEEDS OF THE COUNTRY AND IF NUMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE INCORRECTLY OF IMPLY OTHERWISE, THEY ARE GIVING AID AND COMFORT TO THOSE ADVERSARIES THAT THEY CLAIM TO CARE ABOUT CONFRONTING >>. GIVE US A REALITY CHECK ON THAT FRONT >>. SO WE HAVE HEARD OVER AND OVER, INCLUDING TODAY FROM SECRETARY AUSTIN, THAT THERE WAS NO LAPSE IN COMMAND. AS SOON AS IT WAS CLEAR THAT HE DIDN'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO DIDN'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE WITH HIS STAFF, HIS POWERS OF AUTHORITIES WERE TRANSFERRED TO HIS DEPUTY SECRETARY. WE DON'T HAVE A VERY SPECIFIC- I MEAN I'M TALKING HOUR BY HOUR- TIMELINE OF WHAT HAPPENED FROM THE TIME SECRETARY AUSTIN WAS TAKEN BY AMBULANCE TO WALTER REED ON THE EVENING OF JANUARY, FIRST MAC UNTIL HE WAS TRANSFERRED. SO, YES, THEY CAN TELL US THAT THERE WAS NO LAPSE IN THE COMMAND AND CONTROL BUT I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU WITHOUT THAT FINITE DETAIL. I DON'T KNOW HOW WE CAN CONFIDENTLY SAY THAT IS TRUE, BESIDES THE FACT THAT THEY ARE TELLING US THAT >>>. THIS IS A WILD SCENE IN TEXAS, WHERE THE BIGGEST WILDFIRE IN THAT STATES HISTORY. LOOK AT THIS SNOW ON THE GROUND. SNOW IS FALLING ON THE BURNED OUT BUILDINGS, BURNT OUT CARS- A TOTAL 180 FROM THE HEAT THAT HELPED TO FUEL THE FIRE. HELPED TO FUEL THE FIRE THAT HAS BECOME DEADLY. PEOPLE ARE NOW STARTING TO RETURN TO THEIR HOMES TO SEE WHAT, IF ANYTHING, IS LEFT, AND FOR SOME PEOPLE THE ANSWER IS NOT MUCH. >>. WE BASICALLY, HAVE LOST EVERYTHING. I'VE GOT THE SHIRT, THAT'S IT. >>. I WANT TO BRING IN GUAD IT'S ALMOST TOUGH TO IT'S ALMOST TOUGH, TO COMPREHEND THAT THERE IS THIS MASSIVE WILDFIRE THAT'S DESTROYING PEOPLE'S LIVES AND AT THE SAME TIME, YOU'VE GOT SNOW FALLING ON THE GROUND. HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN? >>. Reporter HALLIE, IT'S THE WEATHER IN THE PANHANDLE. I'VE BEEN SPEAKING WITH AUTHORITIES AND THEY SAY THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT CAUSES A LOT OF THESE FIRES. BECAUSE IT'S WINDY. THE WEATHER CHANGES A LOT. THE CONDITIONS GO FROM COLD TO HOT. JUST MINUTES AGO WE WERE DOWN THE ROAD- IT WAS RAINING. EARLIER TODAY WE'VE SEEN ICE. SO THOSE CONDITIONS ARE GOING TO HELP THE CREWS THAT ARE FIGHTING THE FIRES BUT WHEN I ASKED THE PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICER HOW THAT'S GOING TO HELP, HE SAYS TO ME: YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP. TO ME, YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP SOMETHING IN MIND. THESE FIRES BURN FOR SO LONG AND THEY WERE SO HOT THAT IT WOULD TAKE DAYS OF RAIN FOR THAT TO BE PUT OUT. YOU SEE, BEHIND ME. EARLIER, WE WERE DOWN THERE WHEN IT WAS RAINING AND YOU SAW SOME OF THOSE TREES. LOGS STILL BURNING, WITH THE SMOKE COMING UP AS THE RAIN WAS COMING DOWN, THE PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICER TELLING ME IT'S PARTS LIKE THAT THAT WILL REMAIN HOT EVEN, THAT THAT WILL REMAIN HOT EVEN WITH THE RAIN. YOU TALK ABOUT THE DESTRUCTION. THIS IS ONE OF THE HOUSES IN CANADIAN TEXAS AND THIS IS WHAT IS LEFT OF SOME OF THOSE HOMES. IT ONLY TOOK MINUTES FROM THE MOMENT THEY SAW THE FLAMES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HILL AND THEY HAD TO EVACUATE. SO THE WEATHER WILL HELP BUT THEY DO EXPECT THE CONDITIONS TO CHANGE. WE DO EXPECT MORE WINDY CONDITIONS WHICH WILL LOCATE THINGS. >>. WE KNOW THAT ALREADY ONE WOMAN HAS BEEN KILLED IN THE FIRE, WHICH, AGAIN, THIS IS THE BIGGEST ONE TEXAS HAS EVER SEEN. THE SCARY THING IS THAT OFFICIALS SAY THEY HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED SEARCHING SOME OF THE SPOTS. >> Reporter. THAT'S CORRECT. >> Reporter, THAT'S CORRECT. SO WE HAVE A? -- FOR MAJOR FIRES. ONE OF THOSE IS THE LARGEST IN HISTORY: THE SMOKE HOUSE FIRE. JUST THAT FIRE, ALONE, HAS BURNED 1 MILLION ACRES. WE HAVE THE REPORT OF ONE. WE HAVE THE REPORT OF ONE PERSON WHO HAS DIED. SHE WAS PERSON WHO HAS DIED. SHE WAS IDENTIFIED. EARLIER TODAY WE SPOKE TO HER SON, PAUL, WHO SAID THIS ABOUT LOSING HIS MOTHER: >>. SHE WAS A GOOD MOTHER. SHE ALWAYS TOOK CARE OF US, MADE SURE, WE WERE FED AND HAD EVERYTHING WE NEEDED. >>. Reporter. WE ALSO KNOW THAT JOYCE WAS A FORMER SUBSTITUTE TEACHER, AN 83-YEAR-OLD GRANDMOTHER THAT HAS DIED AS A RESULT OF THESE WILDFIRES AND MEANWHILE HALLIE. THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THESE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE OW RETURNING TO FIND. THIS YESTERDAY, WHEN WE WERE THERE, THE AUTHORITIES WEREN'T ALLOWING THEM TO COME BACK TO THEIR HOMES BECAUSE IT WASN'T SAFE. SO TODAY THEY WILL BE SAFE. SO TODAY THEY WILL BE RETURNING TO FIND. SEEMS LIKE THIS HERE, WHERE THE HOUSE HAS BURNED DOWN. >>> BACK HERE IN WASHINGTON, YOU ARE ABOUT TO SEE THE MOMENT THAT THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OFFICIALLY KICKED THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN TO ANOTHER DAY. >>. ON THIS VOTE, THE BILL IS PASSED. >>. LET ME PUT THAT INTO HUMAN ENGLISH FOR YOU. THIS IS THE HOUSE DECIDING ACTUALLY. WE ARE NOT GOING TO DEAL WITH THIS TODAY. THEY ARE PUSHING THE DEADLINES AGAIN. ONE OF THEM WAS TOMORROW AT MIDNIGHT AND NOW WE ARE TALKING- MARCH 8th AND MARCH 22nd, THE HOUSE SPEAKER MIKE JOHNSON, PROMISING TO SLASH THE BUDGET. >>. THE APPROPRIATIONS PROCESS IS UGLY. THIS IS THE WAY IT WORKS. EVERY YEAR THERE WILL BE REAL CUTS TO NONDEFENSE, DISCRETIONARY SPENDING. >>. RYAN NOBLES IS JOINING US FROM CAPITOL HILL. SPEAKER JOHNSON WANTS CUTS, EVEN WITH THIS DELAY. IS HE GOING TO GET THEM? GOING TO GET THEM? WE ARE ON THE FIFTH DEADLINE, THE FIFTH CAN THAT THE HOUSE HAS KICKED ACROSS TWO SPEAKERS AND THOSE MASSIVE CUTS THEY JUST HAVEN'T HAPPENED. >>. Reporter, AND THERE IS NO WORLD IN WHICH HE GETS THOSE DEEP CUTS THAT HE'S LOOKING FOR. THIS IS A BILL THAT HAS TO BE AGREED TO BY REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS IF THERE'S ANY HOPE OF PASSING THROUGH CONGRESS AND GETTING TO THE PRESIDENT DESK. IN REALITY, DEMOCRATS ARE NOT GOING TO GET THE SPENDING INCREASES THAT THEY ARE LOOKING FOR, AND REPUBLICANS WON'T GET THE CUTS THEY ARE LOOKING FOR. THEY'VE ALREADY AGREED TO HOW MUCH MONEY THEY WILL SPEND, SO WHAT THEY ARE HAGGLING OVER RIGHT NOW IS HOW TO APPLY THAT MONEY TO THE VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS THAT NEED TO BE FUNDED. ON THESE TWO EADLINES, IT SEEMS LIKELY THEY WILL BE ABLE TO GET HALF THE GOVERNMENT FUNDED BY NEXT FRIDAY. THAT'S PART OF WHAT THEY ARE ALLAYING ACTION ON RIGHT NOW. IT GIVES MEMBERS THE OPPORTUNITIES TO LOOK AT THE BILLS. IT'S THE SECOND TRANCHE OF BILLS. THE BIGGEST APARTMENTS, HOMELAND SECURITY DEFENSE DEPARTMENT, THE STATE DEPARTMENT- THAT'S WHERE THERE COULD BE SOME DISAGREEMENT, PARTICULARLY WITH CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICANS WHO ARE REALLY BEGGING SPEAKER JOHNSON TO TRY AND HOLD FIRM, EVEN IF IT MEANS SHUTTING DOWN THE GOVERNMENT. THERE IS A LONG PERIOD OF TIME BETWEEN WHERE WE ARE TODAY, ON LEAP DAY, HALLIE AND MARCH 22nd, SO ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN BETWEEN NOW AND THEN. >>. THANK YOU SO MUCH. I APPRECIATE IT. >>>. A NEW INVESTIGATION INTO WHETHER CARS MADE IN CHINA COULD BE USED TO SPY ON AMERICANS. THE SECRETARY OF COMMERCE ARGUING: THESE CARS HAVE SO MUCH TECHNOLOGY. THEY ARE BASICALLY LIKE SMART PHONES ON WHEELS THAT CAN COLLECT AMERICANS DATA. THEY ARE A LOT CHEAPER THAN OTHER CARS. THE US DOES NOT WANT THOSE CARS TO FLOOD OUR MARKET, ANDREA. THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS THIS IS LIKE A NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUE, POTENTIALLY >>. THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT HAS THE AUTHORITY WHEN THEY SEE NATIONAL SECURITY THREATS TO TAKE ACTION. SHE TOLD ME THAT SHE CAN ACTUALLY BAN THESE CARS. THE SOFTWARE THEY HAVE BEEN EXPLODING. THEY HAVE PASSED TESLA. THEY ARE 9% OF THE EUROPEAN MARKET- VERY FEW SOLD HERE, BUT THE SOFTWARE IS WHAT IS AVAILABLE. AND NOW THEY ARE TRYING TO GET AROUND THE TARIFF PROBLEM BY ASSEMBLING THEM IN MEXICO. SO I ASKED THE SECRETARY: THIS IS GOING TO TAKE ABOUT TWO MONTHS AND THEY WILL MAKE THE DECISION. I SAID WHAT IS THE THREAT, AND HERE'S WHAT SHE SAID. AND HERE'S WHAT SHE SAID: >>. IMAGINE A WORLD IN WHICH THERE ARE MILLIONS OF CHINESE CARS ON US ROADS, COLLECTING THIS DATA EVERY MINUTE OF EVERY DAY AND SENDING IT BACK TO BEIJING. THIS ISN'T THE STEEL. AND HE WHEELS. THIS IS THE SOFTWARE, WHEELS. THIS IS THE SOFTWARE. AND THE SENSORS? >>, SHE SAID, THEY CAN BE OPERATED REMOTELY. SO IF THEY ARE FLOODING THE MARKET, BEIJING COULD STOP. MILLIONS OF CARS ALL OVER AMERICAN ROADWAYS WITH THE FLIP OF A SWITCH. I SAID: IS THIS JUST PROTECTIONISM? IT'S AN ELECTION YEAR. SHE SAID: NO, THIS IS NOT FOR THE AUTOMAKERS. THIS IS NATIONAL SECURITY AND SHE CAN TAKE THE ACTION. SO IT'S NOT A TRADE ISSUE. >>. WHAT WOULD A TIMELINE LOOK LIKE. IT'S NOT LIKE. WE ARE SEEING THESE CARS AS COMMONLY AS WE SEE TESLAS, SEE TESLAS >> AROUND THE CORNER. THEY ARE SELLING ALL OVER LATIN AMERICA AND THEY CAN BE REASSEMBLED IN MEXICO AND SOLD HERE WITHOUT ANY BARRIERS. TWO MONTHS EXACTLY, SHE COULD MAKE THIS DECISION AND TAKE SOME ACTION >>. WE TALKED YESTERDAY ABOUT AND THE DRUGS FOR WEIGHT LOSS >>. WHAT AN INTERESTING LOOK AT THIS DEVELOPMENT. THANK YOU SO MUCH >>>. LET'S GET YOU OVER TO THE FIVE THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW. ABOUT NUMBER 1, THE FBI DIRECTOR WARNING TODAY THE COUNTRY WILL FACE MORE COMPLEX THREATS TO ELECTIONS THIS YEAR. HE SAID AI AND OTHER ADVANCES HAVE MADE IT EASIER FOR FOREIGN ADVERSARIES TO TARGET VOTERS. HE'S ALSO SUGGESTING THE FBI WOULD SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT WOULD SHARE INFORMATION. ABOUT THREATS >>>. THE CDC SAID THERE'S AN AVERAGE OF 488 DEATHS EVERY DAY FROM TOO MUCH DRINKING, AT THE HEIGHT OF THE PANDEMIC. THAT'S UP NEARLY 30% FROM WHAT THE NUMBERS WERE FROM A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO. THEY ALSO SAY ALTHOUGH THERE WERE MORE ALCOHOL-RELATED DEATHS. THE INCREASE IS BIGGER FOR WOMEN. FOR WOMEN >>>. NETFLIX IS PROBABLY GOING TO RAISE PRICES AGAIN THIS YEAR. ACCORDING TO ALICE, THE COMPANY ALREADY BOOSTED THE PRICE OF THE BASIC PLAN TO DOLLARS. IT WENT FROM $10 TO 12 BUCKS LAST OCTOBER. NETFLIX HAS NOT CONFIRMED ANY PRICE HIKE YET BUT EXECUTIVES HAVE SAID IT'S ON THE TABLE. HAVE SAID IT'S ON THE TABLE >>>. LATEBREAKING NEWS: GUESS WHAT? CAITLIN CLARK IS TAKING HER TALENTS TO THE WNBA DRAFT- TALENTS TO THE WNBA DRAFT. SHE ANNOUNCED THAT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO FULLY EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE FOR THOSE WHO SUPPORTED HER JOURNEY. THE DRAFT WELL HAPPEN IN MID APRIL. SHE'S GOT A LOT OF SEASON LEFT IN HER. WE WILL SEE IF SHE BREAKS THE MAN'S SCORING RECORD THIS WEEKEND. >>>. KENSINGTON PALACE IS NOW RESPONDING TO ALL THE SPECULATION OVER PRINCESS CATES ABSENCE FROM THE PUBLIC EYE. YOU HAVE THE SPOKESPERSON TODAY PUTTING OUT A STATEMENT SAYING THAT KATE IS DOING WELL AND HER TEAM WILL ONLY PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT UPDATES AND WHAT SEEMS TO BE A RESPONSE TO THE SEEMS TO BE A RESPONSE TO THE GROWING QUESTIONS ABOUT WHERE SHE IS. THE PALACE SAID SHE'S RECOVERING FROM A PLANNED ABDOMINAL SURGERY AND HAS SAID SINCE THE BEGINNING THAT SHE WON'T COME BACK TO THE JOB UNTIL THE END OF MARCH BUT KATE- ARGUABLY ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS PEOPLE IN THE WORLD- HAS NOT BEEN SEEN IN PUBLIC SINCE CHRISTMAS AND A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO, PRINCE WILLIAM PULLED OUT OF A MEMORIAL SERVICE BECAUSE OF A PERSONAL MATTER- PERSONAL MATTER. SO ALL OF THAT TOGETHER LIKE. IF YOU HAVE BEEN ON THE INTERNET. YOU HAVE PROBABLY SEEN IT. SOME OF THE GASES, SOME OF THE CONSPIRACY THEORIES ABOUT WHERE SHE COULD BE AND WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED TO HER, WE WILL BRING IN MATT BRADLEY. ANY HUMAN HAS ANY RIGHT TO RECOVER IN PRIVATE AND SHE CERTAINLY HAS THAT. BUT THIS IS ONE OF THOSE INSTANCES WHERE THE PALACE, PLUS NO SIGHTINGS OF KATE, HAS PEOPLE REALLY WONDERING. WHAT IS GOING ON HERE >>. ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS IS IT WAS THE INTERNET MACHINE THAT FORCED THIS STATEMENT FROM THE PALACE. NOTHING HAS REALLY HAPPENED HERE. THE PALACE HASN'T SAID ANYTHING. IT WAS JUST. THIS RISE IN CONSPIRACY IS ON THE INTERNET AND JOKES PRETTY FUNNY ONES, TO BE HONEST. THAT PUSHED THE PALACE TO MAKE THIS STATEMENT? IT WAS ALMOST A LITTLE BIT. IT WAS ALMOST A LITTLE BIT IMPATIENT, A LITTLE BIT ANNOYED. AND THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF SPECULATION ONLINE AND IT'S BECAUSE OF THE EVENTS THAT YOU MENTIONED, THIS KIND OF -FOR-TAT BETWEEN ALL OF THE MESSAGES ON THE INTERNET. >> THERE'S PLENTY OF STUFF ON. >> THERE'S PLENTY OF STUFF ON THE INTERNET ABOUT THE ROYALS ALL THE TIME. AND THE PALACE DOES NOT RESPOND TO ALL OF IT >>. NEVER COMPLAIN, NEVER EXPLAIN. THAT'S THEIR MO FOR SO LONG BUT THESE AREN'T REGULAR ROYALS, THESE AREN'T REGULAR ROYALS, THESE ARE COOL ROYALS AND THEY AREN'T REALLY THE SAME MODE OF. YOU KNOW QUEEN ELIZABETH, WHO RECENTLY DIED OF COURSE. SHE WAS PRETTY PRIVATE ABOUT HER HEALTH AND HER FATHER DIED WITHOUT ANYBODY IN THE COUNTRY KNOWING THAT HE HAD CANCER. SO THIS IS KIND OF A DIFFERENT ROYAL FAMILY. THEY USED TO KEEP EVERYTHING SUPERTIGHT. AND YOU ARE SEEING THE BIG THING NOW: KING CHARLES. HE'S GOING AROUND TALKING ABOUT HIS OWN EXPERIENCE WITH CANCER, AND HE'S DOING IT IN SUCH A PUBLIC WAY. THAT'S WHY THE SILENCE IS SO DEAFENING, ESPECIALLY FOR ROYAL WATCHERS. THIS REALLY IS STARTLING, BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE ARE PRETTY OPEN. >>>. HOW LONG AN AMERICAN DETAINED IN RUSSIA IS GOING TO HAVE TO STAY BEHIND BARS AFTER HAVE TO STAY BEHIND BARS AFTER THIS BALLERINAS APPEAL GOT >>. NEWS FOR THE GENERATION OF NOW IS NBC NEWS NOW. >>>. NEW QUESTIONS TONIGHT AFTER A CHAOTIC ATTACK IN NORTHERN GAZA WITH AT LEAST 100 PEOPLE KILLED, Q ACCORDING TO A SPOKESPERSON, ISRAELI TROOPS SHOWING THE ATTACK AND THE PANIC PEOPLE ARE SURROUNDING AND EIGHT TRUCK AND GUNSHOTS STARTED GOING OFF. PRESIDENT BIDEN ACKNOWLEDGING THIS DEADLY VIOLENCE WILL COMPLICATE TALKS TO PAUSE FIGHTING AND GET THOSE ROUGHLY? 130 HOSTAGES STILL BEING HELD BY HAMAS AND OTHERS OUT. >>. HOPE SPRINGS ETERNAL. I WAS ON THE PHONE WITH THE PEOPLE OF THE REGION. I'M HOPEFUL >>. I WANT TO BRING IN RALPH >>. I WANT TO BRING IN RALPH SANCHEZ >>. ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS GIVING TWO VERY DIFFERENT ACCOUNTS OF WHAT HAPPENED. STARTING AT 4:00 AM THIS MORNING, HUNDREDS OF PALESTINIANS GATHERED ON THIS STREET, A COASTAL ROAD IN GAZA STREET, A COASTAL ROAD IN GAZA CITY, AND THEY WERE WAITING AT A DISTRIBUTION POINT, HOPING TO GET FOOD. SOME FLOUR, THE USAID ONE IN FOUR GAZANS ARE A STEP ONE IN FOUR GAZANS ARE A STEP AWAY FROM FAMINE. AT THIS POINT, AN EYEWITNESS SAID THAT ISRAELI FORCES AT A CHECKPOINT STARTED SHOOTING AT THE CROWD BEFORE ANY OF THE TRUCKS ARRIVED, AND CONTINUED SHOOTING LATER AS THE CROWDS SURGED TOWARD THE TRUCK, HE SAID. THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY SAID THAT MORE THAN 100 PEOPLE WERE KILLED, HOSPITALS FLOODED WITH GUNSHOT VICTIMS >>. THE ISRAELI MILITARY IS SAYING THAT MOST OF THE DEAD WERE KILLED IN A STAMPEDE IN THE CHAOS SURROUNDING THE TRUCK. SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE MAY HAVE BEEN RUN OVER BY THE TRUCKS THEMSELVES. AND THEY ARE SAYING THAT THEIR FORCES OPENED FIRE ONLY AT A VERY SPECIFIC GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO WERE THREATENINGLY APPROACHING THEIR POSITION. I ASKED THE MILITARY SPOKESMAN: EARLIER, DO YOU HAVE ANY EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THAT CLAIM, THAT YOUR FORCES WERE BEING THREATENED? THEY SAID THEY HAD NOTHING TO PROVIDE. AT THIS POINT, YOU HEARD THE PRESIDENT SAY HE FEARS THAT THIS WILL COMPLICATE WHAT WERE ALREADY VERY DIFFICULT CEASE-FIRE, DIFFICULT CEASE-FIRE NEGOTIATIONS, NEGOTIATIONS THAT, AT THIS POINT, APPEAR TO BE BASICALLY STALLED. IF THERE'S ANY CAUSE FOR OPTIMISM, RIGHT NOW, IT'S THAT THE LAST CEASE-FIRE DEAL, BACK IN NOVEMBER, WAS ALSO NEGOTIATED DURING A PERIOD OF PRETTY INTENSE BLOODSHED IN GAZA. THAT SAID: THIS IS A MUCH BIGGER DEAL AND A MUCH MORE COMPLICATED DEAL, AND IT'S NOT CLEAR IF THESE TWO SIDES CAN GET IT DONE. >>>. TO RUSSIA NOW, WHERE A SIBERIAN COURT IS DENYING AN AMERICAN BALLERINAS APPEAL. AMERICAN BALLERINAS APPEAL, KSENIYA KARELINA HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF TREASON FOR APPARENTLY DONATING SOMETHING LIKE $52 TO UKRAINE AND POSTING MESSAGES AGAINST THE WAR. ACCORDING TO RUSSIAN STATE MEDIA, SHE FACES UP TO 20 YEARS IN PRISON. YOU ARE JUST HEARING FROM KARELINA'S BOYFRIEND WHAT IS HE TELLING YOU? >>. THIS IS ANOTHER DEPRESSING EXAMPLE OF AN AMERICAN CITIZEN HELD IN RUSSIA. KSENIYA KARELINA LEARNED TODAY THAT SHE WILL BE HELD FOR ANOTHER MONTH, AND I SUSPECT, GIVEN THE OTHER EXAMPLES, THAT IT MIGHT BE LONGER THAN THAT, AND THAT'S WHAT HER BOYFRIEND ASKED HE HAD TO COME TO TERMS WITH. HE TOLD US THAT SHE IS ONLY ABLE TO SHOWER ONCE A WEEK WHERE SHE IS BEING HELD. LET'S LISTEN. >>. WE ARE GOING TO NEED A MIRACLE. IT'S PAINFUL $51.80 DONATION- I STILL CAN'T WRAP MY HEAD AROUND IT- BECAUSE OF A SIMPLE DONATION. BECAUSE OF A SIMPLE DONATION, BECAUSE SHE IS KIND >>. I ASKED WHAT HIS MESSAGE WOULD BE TO PRESIDENT PUTIN AND HE SAID SHE IS INNOCENT, SHE'S NOT A POLITICIAN AND SHE DOES NOT DESERVE TO BE IN PRISON. >>. IT'S HAPPENING ON THE SAME DAY AS PUTIN HIMSELF IS ISSUING. YOU KNOW I DON'T WANT TO SAY NEW WARNING TO THE WEST, BECAUSE IT ECHOES WHAT HE'S BEEN SAYING FOR A LONG TIME: HE WANTS THE WEST TO STAY OUT OF THE WAY OF THE INVASION OF NATO OR UKRAINE. I SHOULD SAY: >> YEAH, IT COMES AFTER THE PRESIDENT OF FRANCE. HE MADE MANY HEADLINES SUGGESTING THAT THERE COULD BE NATO BOOTS ON THE GROUND INSIDE UKRAINE. BY THE WAY, THERE IS NOW AN ARGUMENT BETWEEN GERMANY AND FRANCE AND THE UK AFTER THE GERMAN CHANCELLOR SUGGESTED THAT THERE WERE FRENCH AND THAT THERE WERE FRENCH AND BRITISH SOLDIERS IN UKRAINE ALREADY. AND THEN YOU HAVE PRESIDENT PUTIN TODAY. I MEAN ALL OF THIS JUST UNDERSCORES. I THINK FRANKLY WHAT IS A REAL MESS OF UKRAINE RIGHT NOW? AND YOU NOW HAVE PUTIN ESSENTIALLY WARNING OF A NUCLEAR WAR. NOW WE HAVE THE STATE DEPARTMENT WEIGHING IN. >>. IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE SEEN IRRESPONSIBLE RHETORIC FROM VLADIMIR PUTIN. IT'S NO WAY FOR A LEADER TO SPEAK. WE HAVE COMMUNICATED IN THE PAST, PRIVATELY AND DIRECTLY, WITH RUSSIA ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE USE OF A NUCLEAR WEAPON. THAT, SAID. WE DO NOT HAVE ANY SIGN THAT RUSSIA IS PREPARING TO USE A NUCLEAR WEAPON AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THIS >>. PUTIN IN THAT SPEECH, CELEBRATING, IF YOU LIKE, SUCCESS ON THE BATTLEFIELD FRANKLY. THE FRONT LINES HAVE HARDLY MOVED IN RECENT MONTHS AND TALKING ABOUT RUSSIAN SOLDIERS GOING THROUGH THIS- THIS IS HIS WORDS- GOING THROUGH THIS WAR. ONCE UPON A TIME, HE WOULDN'T ONCE UPON A TIME HE WOULDN'T EVEN CALL IT A WAR >>>. NBC NEWS COVERS HUNDREDS OF STORIES A DAY AND BECAUSE IT CAN BE TOUGH TO LISTEN TO THEM, ALL OUR VIEWERS HAVE DONE IT FOR YOU. THIS IS WHAT THEY TELL US IS GOING DOWN. THIS IS A SEGMENT. WE CALL THE LOCAL. >>. YOU GOT CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL RESCUING A MAN. TWO DAYS AFTER, HIS CAR FELL DOWN. THAT CLIFF, CLIFF. THAT IS THE CAR AND THAT'S THE ROPE THEY ARE LOWERING DOWN AND THAT IS THE RESCUER THAT THEY ARE SENDING DOWN TO LIFT THIS MAN UP. THE DRIVER SAID. HE SWERVED TO AVOID HITTING A DEER AND, INCREDIBLY, HE IS EXPECTED TO BE OKAY. >>>. A CAR IN NEW HAMPSHIRE LOOK AT THAT, FULLY FLIPPED ON ITS SIDE IN THE DRIVE-THROUGH OF A DUNCAN OF A DUNCAN. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT SAID THE CAR DROVE ONTO A CONCRETE FILLED METAL PIPE AND STILL. NO WORD ON WHETHER THE DRIVER DID IN FACT. GET THERE, DUNCAN AFTER THAT. GET THERE, DUNCAN AFTER THAT. >>>. A BABY PIG CEREMONIOUSLY PARDONED. TODAY AFTER HE GOT TOSSED AROUND LIKE A FOOTBALL IN NEW ORLEANS. PEOPLE WERE THROWING IN A PARK AND LAUGHING WHEN A BYSTANDER STEPPED IN THE PIGLET HAS BEEN ADOPTED BY A CONGRESSWOMAN. >>> NEW REPORTING FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES SHOWING JUST HOW DANGEROUS THOUGH WORLD OF CHILD. >>> BREAKING NEWS: THIS IS FROM. >>> BREAKING NEWS, THIS IS FROM ANNAPOLIS. APPARENTLY, THE MARYLAND STATE HOUSE IS UNDER LOCKDOWN. THERE SOME KIND OF SECURITY THREAT. THAT'S ACCORDING TO MARYLAND'S GOVERNOR. THERE'S NOT MUCH MORE INFORMATION AT THE TIME, BUT STAFF NUMBERS, PEOPLE ON THE GROUND SHOULD SHELTER-IN-PLACE AND LISTEN TO DIRECTIONS FROM ANY AVAILABLE MEMBER OF POLICE OR LAW ENFORCEMENT. QUESTIONS ON WHY THERE HAS BEEN THIS LOCKDOWN APPARENTLY OF THE MARYLAND STATE HOUSE IN ANNAPOLIS. YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE FEED COMING IN FROM ONE OF OUR LOCAL STATIONS. POLICE WITH WEAPONS DRAWN ARE POLICE WITH WEAPONS DRAWN ARE HEADING INTO THE BUILDING? WE WILL BRING IT TO YOU THE SECOND WE GET IT >>> ARE BEHIND-THE-SCENES LOOK AT HOW A STORY COMES TOGETHER AND HOW IT FITS INTO THE BIGGER PICTURE. WE ARE LOOKING AT AN INVESTIGATION ABOUT THE RISE IN POPULATION OF YOUNGER GIRL INFLUENCES, THE SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS MANAGED BY THEIR PARENTS. THESE ACCOUNTS ALSO APPARENTLY- THESE ACCOUNTS ALSO APPARENTLY DRYING PEDOPHILES, THE SPEAK TO JUST HOW DANGEROUS THE WORLD OF CHILD INFLUENCING CAN BE FOR TWEEN'S, WHEN A THIRD OF PRETEENS WANT TO BE INFLUENCERS. SUNDAY, I WANT TO BRING IN JENNIFER VALENTINO, THE REPORTER, WITH THAT STORY. THAT STORY >>. WE ARE SO GLAD TO HAVE YOU ON ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE DEPTH OF WHAT YOU REPORTED, WITH YOU AND YOUR TEAM LOOKING AT THOUSANDS OF ACCOUNTS. AT ONE POINT YOU WRITE: IT IS SHOWING, DISTURBING INSIGHTS INTO HOW SOCIAL MEDIA IS RESHAPING CHILDHOOD, ESPECIALLY FOR GIRLS, WITH DIRECT PARENTAL ENCOURAGEMENT AND INVOLVEMENT. THIS IS A HUGE INVESTIGATION. WHERE DID THE REPORTING START FOR YOU? >>? THIS STARTED BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. MY COLLEAGUE ON THIS PIECE WERE LOOKING INTO HOW SOCIAL MEDIA MIGHT BE AFFECTING YOUNG GIRLS AND STARTED DOING SEARCHES ON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS WITH THINGS LIKE TWEEN INFLUENCERS. THEY HAVE THIS INFLUENCER CULTURE AND IT MIGHT BE TRICKLING DOWN TO THE YOUNGER SET AND WE WERE FINDING ALL OF THESE ACCOUNTS THAT WERE RUN BY PARENTS. I HAD NO IDEA, UNTIL WE LOOKED AT THIS, THAT THERE OULD EVEN BE SUCH A THING. AS A TWEEN INFLUENCER- AND YOU KNOW, WE PITCHED THIS STORY AND I WAS LOOKING AT ONE OF OUR PITCHES AND IT WAS IN JANUARY OR FEBRUARY OF 2020, AND WE ALL KNOW WHAT HAPPENED IMMEDIATELY AFTER THAT. THERE WAS A LOT OF NEWS INTERVENING IN THE MEANTIME AND FINALLY, WE WERE ABLE TO PICK IT UP AGAIN LAST YEAR AND LOOK INTO THIS, BECAUSE WE STILL FELT IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT. >>. IT'S INCREDIBLE TO KNOW HOW LONG THIS WAS IN THE WORKS. HOW DID YOU KEEP TRACK OF ALL OF THIS, OF THIS? >>. I THINK IT WAS JUST A MASSIVE UNDERTAKING. WE USED A LOT OF GOOGLE SPREADSHEETS AND FILE FOLDERS ON OUR COMPUTERS AND YOU KNOW THAT WAS ONE OF THE IG TASKS WE HAD- WAS KEEPING IT ORGANIZED, BUT IT WAS SO IMPORTANT FOR US TO REALLY GET THE FULL SCOPE OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING, RATHER THAN JUST TRYING TO RELY ON TALKING WITH ONE OR TWO PEOPLE. >>. YOU TALK ABOUT THESE CONVERSATIONS. I KNOW YOU TALK TO PARENTS WHO RUN THE ACCOUNT, AND ONE MOM TOLD YOU IN A COMMENT THAT OUR TOLD YOU IN A COMMENT THAT OUR TEAM PICKED UP ON SHE SAID. SHE SAID A PACK OF MONSTERS. THAT'S HOW SHE PHRASED IT. SHE SAID HER DAUGHTER HAS WRITTEN HERSELF OFF AND DECIDED THE ONLY WAY SHE WOULD HAVE A FUTURE IS TO MAKE A MINT ON ONLY FANS, ONLY FANS. THAT'S A QUOTE. THERE WAS IT, THAT KIND OF THING THAT SURPRISED YOU MOST IN THE COURSE OF YOUR REPORTING, OR WAS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU REPORTED OUT THAT REALLY SHOCKED YOU ABOUT THIS? >>. I THINK A LOT OF THIS WAS SURPRISING AND THAT WAS SOME OF IT. AND SHE WAS NOT AT ALL THE ONLY PARENT WHO HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR SOME TIME WHO EXPRESSED SOME SORT OF REGRET FOR AT LEAST PART OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED, AND SHE SAID NOW THAT THEY HAVE BEEN TO THIS. THEY DID NOT THINK THAT CHILDREN SHOULD BE ON SOCIAL MEDIA IN THIS WAY AT ALL. YOU KNOW, I WAS SURPRISED, HONESTLY. THERE ARE STILL ACCOUNTS LIKE THIS BEING OPENED, ACCOUNTS LIKE THIS BEING OPENED ALL THE TIME. IT'S HARD TO KEEP TRACK OF NEW ACCOUNTS AND PEOPLE COMING INTO THIS WORLD AND I THINK A LOT OF PARENTS THINK THAT THEY'RE GOING INTO THIS AND INFLUENCER. CULTURE IS REALLY NORMALIZED, ESPECIALLY, REALLY NORMALIZED ESPECIALLY IN GENERATION Z, AND I THINK SOME PEOPLE ARE JUST NOT AWARE OF HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO KEEP KIDS SAFE ON THESE PLATFORMS. >>. THAT BRINGS US TO THE ACCOUNTABILITY FACTOR. DID YOU FIND THAT, AS YOU ARE TRYING TO GET ANSWERS, THAT THE COMPANIES WERE RESPONSIVE TO THIS? >>. YOU KNOW, I THINK THE LARGEST PLAYER HERE IS META, BECAUSE WHAT WE FOUND IT'S REALLY ON INSTAGRAM, THIS PARTICULAR WORLD, PARTLY BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE BRANDS ARE. THESE KIDS ARE REPRESENTATIVES FOR BRANDS THAT MAKE THINGS LIKE LEOTARDS AND CHILDREN'S DANCE OUTFITS, AND THOSE PLAYERS REALLY WANT TO BE ON INSTAGRAM BECAUSE THAT'S EASIER FOR THEM. AND I THINK WHEN WE WERE TALKING WITH THE BRANDS AND TALKING WITH THE BRANDS AND WITH META, THE RESPONSE WAS NOT ENTIRELY SATISFYING. SOME BRANDS REALLY WORK TO KEEP THEIR FOLLOWERS CLEAN BUT HAD A HARD TIME AND OTHERS JUST KIND OF THROUGH THEIR HANDS IN THE AIR AND THEY FOUND IT SO DIFFICULT. >>. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR GIVING. >>. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR GIVING US A LOOK BEHIND THE SCENES OF WHAT GOES INTO A PIECE LIKE THAT. I ENCOURAGE FOLKS TO READ IT. THANKS FOR BEING WITH US. >>. THANK YOU >>>. MORE TO COME, INCLUDING EVERYTHING YOU WANTED TO KNOW. >>>. IT IS LEAP DAY THAT MAY >>>. IT IS LEAP DAY THAT MAY SEEM LIKE ANY OTHER 24 HOURS. THERE'S A LOT OF SCIENCE AND HISTORY TO THIS. HISTORY TO THIS. ARE YOU CURIOUS ABOUT IT >>. YAHOO, IT'S LEAP DAY, THE EXTRA DAY IN FEBRUARY THAT LANDS ON OUR CALENDARS ONCE EVERY FOUR YEARS. IT MEANS DEALS ON DOUGHNUTS AND FAST FOOD. IT COMMEMORATES THE LIFE OF SAINT OSWALD, WHO DIED ABOUT 1000 YEARS AGO AND WAS FAMOUS 1000 YEARS AGO AND WAS FAMOUS FOR BUILDING MONASTERIES. WE TAKE IT. YOU KNOW, ABOUT THE EARTH'S ANNUAL TRIP AROUND THE SUN. IT TAKES A YEAR, RIGHT WELL. IT REALLY TAKES 365 1/4 DAYS. AND YOU ARE STARTING TO THINK: COME ON, NO ONE SAID ANYTHING ABOUT MATH WELL TEST. ABOUT MATH WELL TEST. THE TRIP TAKES 3 TO 25 DAYS, FIVE HOURS, 40 MINUTES AND 46 SECONDS. AND IF WE DIDN'T ADD A DAY EVERY FOUR YEARS, THEN AFTER A HALF-DOZEN CENTURIES OR SO, SUMMER WOULD TURN INTO WINTER AND WINTER WOULD TURN INTO SUMMER, GIVING A WHOLE NEW MEANING TO CHRISTMAS. IN JULY, WHEN THE AGENT EGYPTIANS BEGAN MEASURING TIME BY DIVIDING THE YEAR INTO 12 MONTHS OF 30 DAYS, THEY ADDED THE FIVE EXTRA DAYS ONTO THE END OF THE YEAR AS FIVE DAYS OF FESTIVALS PARTY ON PHARAOH. BUT SERIOUSLY, TO BE A LEAP YEAR, THE YEAR NUMBER MUST BE DIVISIBLE BY FOUR EASY PC. BUT THAT 365, DAY, FIVE HOUR, 48 MINUTES AND 46 SECONDS- TIMES, FOUR ONLY AT UP TO AN EXTRA 23.2 HOURS, NOT A FULL 24.. SO WHAT IS THE WORLD TO DO? ALL THE LEAP DAYS PILE UP. WE OCCASIONALLY TAKE OUT SOME ONLY GET A LEAP DAY IN END OF CENTURY YEARS DIVISIBLE END OF CENTURY YEARS DIVISIBLE BY 400.. SO THE YEAR 2000 WAS A LEAP YEAR, BUT THE YEAR 1900 WAS NOT. GOT IT ME THERE, FOR ALL OF YOU CELEBRATING FEBRUARY 29 IS YOUR BIRTHDAY. YOU ARE SPECIAL. THINK OF IT THIS WAY, ALL THE KIDS HE WENT TO SCHOOL WITH AND KIDS FROM YOUR GRADE. WHEN THEY TURN 100, YOU WILL BE 25.. GIVE OR TAKE A FEW MINUTES. >>. OUR THANKS TO HARRY SMITH FOR US AND WE HAVE MORE COVERAGE PICKING UP RIGHT NOW >>>. WE COME IN THE AIR WITH A >>>. WE COME IN THE AIR WITH A DRAMATIC SPLIT SCREEN AT THE BORDER, WITH PRESIDENT BIDEN AND FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP IN TEXAS AND BOTH WITH THEIR OWN TAKE ON IT ISSUES. THEY SAY AMERICANS CARE MOST ABOUT IMMIGRATION. IT WILL TAKE YOU THERE. SNOW IS COVERING UP. WHAT HAS BEEN BURNED OUT FROM ONE OF THE BIGGEST WILDFIRES IN THE STATE EVER, AND HOW THEY PLAN TO TAKE THIS ADVANTAGE TONIGHT BEFORE IT HEATS BACK UP AND WE WILL BE THERE LIVE. AND THEN BREAKING NEWS: THE NATIONAL GUARDSMEN, ACCUSED OF LEAKING CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS, CHANGING HIS PLEA TO GUILTY AND WE WILL BREAK DOWN WHY AND THEN ALSO BREAKING THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, RELEASING A TRANSCRIPT FROM THE DEPOSITION OF PRESIDENT BIDEN'S SON HUNTER. WE ARE GETTING THE FIRST GLIMPSE OF WHAT WAS ACTUALLY SAID AS WE ARE COMBING THROUGH IT RIGHT NOW AND WE WILL HAVE THE HIGHLIGHTS IN THE SECOND >>>. OPRAH HAS TAKEN A BIG NAME OFF OF HER FAVORITE THINGS LIST, STEPPING BACK FROM WEIGHT WATCHERS AFTER YEARS OF HER BEING THERE SPOKESPERSON. WE START WITH THE SPLIT SCREEN ON THE BORDER BECAUSE, ON THE FIRST TIME THIS YEAR, WE SEE FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP AND PRESIDENT BIDEN HEAD-TO-HEAD OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE RIGHT NOW: IMMIGRATION. AND WE HAVE THE TOP TWO CANDIDATES 300 MILES APART WITH PRESIDENT BIDEN, BRONZEVILLE AND EAGLE PASS FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP. AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IN MORE THAN A YEAR THE PRESIDENT HAS VISITED AND THAT HE IS TELLING DONALD TRUMP TO GET BEHIND THE BORDER BILL. >>. LET'S GET TOGETHER AND GET. >>. LET'S GET TOGETHER AND GET IT DONE. AND REMEMBER WHO THE HECK YOU WORK FOR, ANY WORK FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, AND NOT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY OR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, BUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE >>. MR TRUMP IS PUTTING THE CRISIS AT THE PRESIDENTS FEET ON AN ISSUE. HE FEELS LIKE HE OWNS COMPARING THIS MOMENT TO THE COUNTRY, BEING AT WAR >>. THE UNITED STATES IS BEING >>. THE UNITED STATES IS BEING OVERRUN BY THE BIDEN MIGRANT CRISIS AND A NEW FORM OF VICIOUS VIOLATION TO OUR COUNTRY >>. HERE IS THE REALITY, BASED ON BORDER CONTROL AND BORDER ENCOUNTERS WAY UP, AND WE WILL GIVE YOU NUMBERS HERE, FROM THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO THE BIDEN MINISTRATION AND ALSO TRUE THAT REPUBLICANS GOT THE BLESSING OF MR TRUMP TO BLOCK A BIPARTISAN BORDER BILL, PASSED BY THE WHITE HOUSE WITH PEOPLE WORKING ON THE BORDER ON THE GROUND, AND THE WHOLE ISSUE IS MAKING AMERICANS FEEL FRUSTRATED HERE AND THAT'S ACROSS PARTY LINES AND PULLED SHOW, THE BIGGEST ISSUES. THAT VOTERS SAY IS MOST IMPORTANT ISN'T INFLATION, THE ECONOMY, THAT IMMIGRATION, AND THE PERSON THEY TRUST MORE TO HANDLE- IT IS DONALD TRUMP- BY A BIG MARGIN OVER PRESIDENT BIDEN, OVER PRESIDENT BIDEN. WE ARE ALIVE IN EAGLE PASS, TEXAS. THIS SPLIT SCREEN MOMENT WE HAVE SEEN FOR A FEW DAYS HAS BEEN COMING WITH DONALD TRUMP AND JOE BIDEN, BOTH IN TEXAS, HUNDREDS OF MILES APART. BUT OUR REPORTING FROM THE WHITE HOUSE SUGGESTED THAT AN ADVISOR SAID THEY REALLY WANT TO CRYSTALLIZE. FOR VOTERS THE CONTRAST, IT WAS DONALD TRUMP AND REPUBLICANS WHO KILLED THE BIPARTISAN BORDER BILL >>. Reporter. YES, WE HAVE BEEN REPORTING THAT BIDEN WOULD BE COMING IN HOT AGAINST FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP. THAT IS IT, EXACTLY WHAT WE SAW FROM PRESIDENT BIDEN TODAY. IN FACT, HE INVITED FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP TO WORK WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP, TO WORK WITH HIM TO LOBBY CONGRESS, TO PASS A BIPARTISAN BORDER BILL. AND THERE WASN'T A DIRECT AND HARSH FINGER-POINTING THAT SOME OF THE STRATEGISTS WANTED TO HEAR FROM HIM, HIS ADVISORS ALSO TELLING US THIS WASN'T A CAMPAIGN STOP BUT AN OFFICIAL VISIT. BUT IT IS EMBLEMATIC OF HOW SERIOUSLY PRESIDENT BIDEN TAKES THIS ISSUE AND THIS WASN'T JUST IN THEIR VISION FOR IMMIGRATION ISSUE BUT THE DIFFERENCES IN CHARACTER. WHERE PRESIDENT BIDEN IS A MAN WHO MADE HIS POLITICAL CAREER ON HIS ABILITY TO EMPATHIZE AND BE THAT SORT OF EMPATHIZE AND BE THAT SORT OF UNCLE JOE AND COMMENT AND KNOW WHERE PEOPLE ARE COMING FROM. BUT FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS MADE HIS POLITICAL CAREER ON BEING MORE BOMBASTIC AND MORE OF THAT FIGHTER STRONGMAN TYPE OF CHARACTER. WE SAW THAT TODAY AND TRUMP SAID BIDEN DESTROYING THIS COUNTRY WHILE BIDEN IS ASKING TRUMP TO WORK WITH THEM >>. THEN THERE ARE THE PEOPLE FEELING CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE BECAUSE THEY SAY THEIR FINDING OR TRYING TO FIND A BETTER WAY >>. Reporter. AND THESE COMMUNITIES ALONG THE TEXAS BORDER AND OTHER PARTS OF THE BORDER IN ARIZONA AND BORDER IN ARIZONA AND CALIFORNIA, AS WELL ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING IN THESE COMMUNITIES, AND THEN THERE ARE THE MIGRANTS COMING ACROSS. SO OFTEN WE HEAR STATISTICS AND THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE COMING, BUT WE DON'T OFTEN TALK ABOUT WHY- AND I WANT YOU TO HEAR A CONVERSATION- >> WHY DID YOU COME HERE TO THE UNITED STATES? >>. Translator. A BETTER LIFE FOR MY SON, BECAUSE IN EL SALVADOR THERE AREN'T ANY OPPORTUNITIES FOR EMPLOYMENT. THERE IS NOTHING. >>. Reporter. THESE FOLKS ARE OFTEN FLEEING LIFE-THREATENING SITUATIONS BUT AT THE SAME TIME THOSE ARE THE ONLY PEOPLE COMING ACROSS. THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN LIVING HERE HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH THIS FOR DECADES. MANY OF THEM EMPHASIZE THAT THEY DO HAVE EMPATHY FOR THESE PEOPLE, BUT MOST OF THE PEOPLE, WHEREVER THEY FALL ON THIS POLITICAL SPECTRUM, WANT MORE TO BE DONE BY THE GOVERNMENT, BE DONE BY THE GOVERNMENT >>. WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT THIS SORT OF FIGHT. IT SEEMS BETWEEN TEXAS, SPECIFICALLY THE GOVERNOR THERE AND THE BIDEN MINISTRATION, AND YOU HAVE THIS BATTLE WITH A FEDERAL JUDGE BLOCKING A LAW THAT WOULD GIVE NEW POWERS TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT, AND TALK ABOUT THAT IMPACT. >>. Reporter. THAT TEXAS LAW WAS AIMED AT GIVING LOCAL POLICE THE ABILITY TO ARREST AND DETAIN MIGRANTS WHO THEY SUSPECT OF COMING ACROSS ILLEGALLY THE BORDER AND A COURT RULING DID BLOCK THAT BUT FOLKS IN TEXAS AND GOVERNOR ABBOTT IS BUSY SAYING THEY WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE THIS BECAUSE THEY FEEL PRESIDENT BIDEN ISN'T DOING ENOUGH. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, THE WHITE HOUSE PRAISES THIS DECISION EAGLE PASS. WHERE I AM IS THE EPICENTER OF THIS FIGHT BETWEEN FEDERAL POWER AND STATE AND LOCAL POWER, AND THIS IS THE REASON WHY GOVERNOR ABBOTT DEPLOYED THOSE FLOATING BUOYS WITH RAZOR WIRE WHERE HE INSTALLED THESE LIKE WHAT YOU SEE BEHIND ME ACROSS THIS PART OF THE BORDER AND WHERE HE HAS THOUSANDS OF NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS REALLY USING THE STATE POWER TO DEFEND THE BORDER. WHEN HE SAID PRESIDENT BIDEN ISN'T DOING ENOUGH. THIS PROTECTING THE BORDER IS A FEDERAL JURISDICTION AND IT KEEPS GOING. >> THANK YOU. >>>. A WILD SCENE IN THE PANHANDLE WITH THE STATE'S BIGGEST FIRE EVER BURNING THROUGH PARTS OF THE STATE AND LOOK AT THAT SNOW ON THE GROUND AND A LAYER OF SNOW COVERING BURNED-OUT HOUSES AND BURNED OUT FRAMES OF CARS. IT IS A TOTAL 180 FROM THE HEAT THAT HELPED FUEL THE WILDFIRE IN THE FIRST PLACE. YOU HAVE CREWS TRYING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS BREAK IN THE HOT WEATHER TO GET SOME CONTROL OVER THE FIRE, BECAUSE WE ARE LEARNING NOW THAT AN 82-YEAR OLD GRANDMOTHER DID DIE IN HER HOME. SOME PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO RETURN TO THEIR COMMUNITIES TO SEE WHAT, IF ANYTHING, IS LEFT, AND FOR SOME FOLKS THE ANSWER IS NOT MUCH >>. BASICALLY, LOST EVERYTHING. THIS IS ONE OF THE ONLY PAIR OF PANTS I GOT AND THIS SHIRT, AND THAT IS IT. >>>. HERE WE ARE, LIVE FROM THIS PART OF THE PANHANDLE, AND IT'S NOT UNFAMILIAR FOR US TO SEE YOU COVER A WILDFIRE, BUT IT DOES SEE UNFAMILIAR TO SEE YOU COVER IN A HAT AND GLOVES, AND THIS IS CLEARLY NOT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND THIS IS MORE RURAL, AND WHAT IS THAT MEAN FOR THINGS LIKE RESOURCES ARE THINGS LIKE GETTING THESE CREWS TO WHERE THEY NEED TO BE >>. I HAVE BEEN COVERING WILDFIRES FOR SEVEN YEARS, AND MOST OF THEM IN CALIFORNIA. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I COVERED THEM WITH COLD CONDITIONS AND WITH SNOW. THIS MORNING WE STARTED OUR DAY WHERE WE WERE WATCHING SOME OF THESE CREWS WORK ON SOME OF THE HOTSPOTS STILL BURNING IN A NEIGHBORHOOD AS THE SNOW WAS COMING DOWN, COMING DOWN. IT IS INCREDIBLE AND A BIT SURREAL. THAT IS WHAT THE WEATHER IS, KE HERE IN THE PANHANDLE, AND OFFICIALS SAY THE WEATHER CHANGES ALL THE TIME AND THE WIND COMES FROM ONE DIRECTION ONE DAY AT A DIFFERENT DIRECTION THE NEXT DAY. THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THESE WILDFIRES SPREAD SO QUICKLY. WE DO HAVE GOOD NEWS: IT HAS BEEN ANNOUNCED THAT MORE RESOURCES ARE COMING IN TO HELP THE FIRE CREWS, AND PRESIDENT BIDEN SAID THEY ARE SENDING AIR TANKERS, HELICOPTERS AND ALSO FEDERAL FIREFIGHTERS THAT, ALONG WITH THE CHANGE IN, THAT ALONG WITH THE CHANGE IN TEMPERATURES, IS GOING TO HELP. AS I SPOKE TO ONE OF THE INFORMATION OFFICERS TODAY, WHEN WE WERE STANDING UNDER THE REIGN, WE SAW SOME OF THESE BURNING HOTSPOTS. IT TOLD ME THAT THERE WERE DAYS OF REIGN FOR SOME OF THESE OF REIGN, FOR SOME OF THESE HOTSPOTS TO STOP BURNING. WITH THE REIGN STOPPING IN PLACES LIKE HERE IN CANADIAN, SOME OF THESE THINGS CAN LIGHT UP AGAIN. YOU MENTIONED THE PROPERTY AND HOMES LOST. YOU CAN SEE THIS HOME BEHIND ME IS BIRTH TO ASHES AND THIS IS ONE OF THE PROPERTIES CAUGHT BY THE FLAMES HERE. >>. THIS SCARY THING TOO IS BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU DESCRIBED AND WHERE THIS FIRE IS SPREADING AND THE FACT THAT PEOPLE ARE ONLY STARTING TO RETURN HOME. WE DON'T YET KNOW HOW BAD THE DESTRUCTION IS >>. Reporter. A GOOD EXAMPLE HERE: A WHOLE COMMUNITY WHERE THE FIRE WENT THROUGH, BUT SO MANY HOTSPOTS AS OF THIS MORNING THAT IT WAS STILL SHUT DOWN TO RESIDENTS BECAUSE AND FIREFIGHTERS DON'T KNOW IF IT IS SAFE TO COME BACK, A LOT OF PEOPLE HAD TO EVACUATE AND THEY ARE WAITING TO SEE IF THEY CAN COME BACK, BECAUSE THEY STILL DON'T KNOW IF THE HOUSE BURNED DOWN OR STILL STANDING. BECAUSE OF THAT, A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE WAITING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS MEANWHILE. THE FIRE SPREADS, AND THE LARGEST ONE, WITH MORE THAN 1 MILLION ACRES, AND IT MADE ITS WAY ALL THE WAY TO THE BORDER WITH OKLAHOMA AND ABOUT 100 MILES, OR MORE THAN 100 MILES LONG ALL THE WAY ON THE WEST SIDE, AND THAT IS THE MAGNITUDE OF THESE WILDFIRES. AND ALSO, AS YOU MENTIONED, WE ALSO HAVE ONE DEATH AS A RESULT: AN 83-YEAR- OLD WOMAN WHO WAS A FORMER SUBSTITUTE TEACHER, AND WE ALSO SPOKE TO HER SON, EARLIER, TODAY, AND THIS IS WHAT HE SAID: >> SHE WAS A GOOD MOTHER AND SHE ALWAYS TOOK CARE OF US AND MADE. SURE WE WERE FED AND HAD MADE SURE WE WERE FED AND HAD EVERYTHING WE NEEDED. >>. A DIFFICULT DAY FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE PANHANDLE, ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO LOST THEIR HOMES. THEY, OF COURSE, WILL HAVE A DIFFERENT LIFE MOVING FORWARD. AS WE WAIT FOR THESE WEATHER CONDITIONS TO CHANGE- BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE TO ADD THAT IT IS EXPECTED TO CHANGE OVER THE WEEKEND, WITH THE WIND PICKING UP AGAIN, WHICH WILL MAKE WORK MORE DIFFICULT FOR THESE CREWS >>. THANK YOU SO MUCH. WE WILL TAKE YOU OVER TO ALABAMA WITH DEVELOPING NEWS LATE TONIGHT, BECAUSE REPUBLICANS THERE HAVE TAKEN SOME OF THE FINAL STEPS TO PROTECT IVF PROCEDURES IN THAT STATE. AFTER THE BOMBSHELL RULING SAYING EMBRYOS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED CHILDREN, AND A RULING THAT ESSENTIALLY PARALYZES A LOT OF PROCEDURES ACROSS THE STATE WITH A CHILLING EFFECT, WITH MULTIPLE HEALTHCARE FACILITIES AND CLINICS PRESSING PAUSE ON THESE PROCEDURES FOR NOW, WHICH CREATED CHAOS FOR FAMILIES TRYING TO START FAMILIES. IT LOOKS TO GIVE IMMUNITY IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE LATEST IVF BUT THE NEXT STEP ARE PROCEDURAL THINGS TO COMBINE THESE PLANS, AND THE GOVERNOR WILL HAVE TO SIGN IT INTO LAW, ALL OF WHICH IS EXPECT TO HAPPEN AS SOON AS NEXT WEEK, AND WE WILL BRING IN LAURA JARRETT FOR MORE. NO FINAL STEPS YET, BUT GETTING CLOSER. AFTER THIS ABSOLUTE NATIONAL FIRESTORM FROM THIS COURT RULING AND REPUBLICANS ACTING VERY QUICKLY TO TRY TO GET A LID ON IT >> WITH AN ALMOST A WEEK, THEY HAVE BASICALLY MIRROR IMAGES OF EACH OTHER, IN BOTH THE HOUSE AND SENATE COMING UP WITH SOLUTIONS AND TO -- REMEMBER- THEY ARE AIMING TO MAKE SURE THAT IT CAN RESUME TO GET PROCEDURES RESTARTED BECAUSE THEY ARE ON HOLD RIGHT NOW WORRIED ABOUT LEGAL LIABILITY. THAT COMES WITH DAMAGING OR DESTROYING AN EMBRYO, A FROZEN EMBRYO. THESE BILLS ESSENTIALLY SAY: NO ACTION FOR OR CRIMINAL PROSECUTION CAN RESULT FROM THE DAMAGE OF THAT EMBRYO. IT DOES TRY TO WOULD ADDRESS THIS AND IT IS A TEMPORARY FIT FOR SIX BUT IT DOESN'T ANSWER THE HARDER QUESTION OF WHERE DOES LIFE BEGIN? ARE FROZEN EMBRYOS CHILDREN? IF THEY ARE, THE HIGHEST COURT IN THE STATE OF ALABAMA HAS SAID: YOU CAN'T DESTROY THEM, AND THAT IS WHAT THE COURT WAS TEASING OUT AND LED TO THE TURMOIL. >>. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN AND HOW TEMPORARY IS THIS? ARE WE LOOKING AT THIS TO PATCH THINGS UP FOR IVF PATIENTS FOR MONTHS OR YEARS? >>. LAWMAKERS REALIZE IT MAY BE. GETS THEM TO A FEW MONTHS SO THAT IT CAN GET RESTARTED AND EVEN THIS HEATED DEBATE TODAY, EVERYBODY SEEMS TO RECOGNIZE AGAIN THAT THERE IS A ONGER TERM SOLUTION AND, CERTAINLY, LEGISLATION THAT NEEDS TO GO DEEPER. THEY DO HOPE THAT THE CLINICS AND SHIPPING COMPANIES WILL RESTART, BECAUSE THAT IS CAUSING THE OUTCRY, WITH PEOPLE NOT BEING ABLE TO GET PROCEDURES WHEN THEY WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF TRYING TO DO THIS EMBRYO, TRYING TO DO THIS EMBRYO TRANSFER >>>. SOME OTHER BREAKING NEWS TONIGHT, WITH PROSECUTORS SIGNALING THE NATIONAL GUARDSMEN ACCUSED OF LEAKING THOUSANDS OF CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS IS EXPECTED TO CHANGE HIS PLEA TO GUILTY THIS CASE. HE IS EXPECTED MONDAY FOR A PLEA HEARING- AND YOU PROBABLY REMEMBER THIS VIDEO, REMEMBER THE VERY DRAMATIC VIDEO AND AERIAL OF HIS ARRESTS. AFTER, A BUNCH OF PENTAGON DOCUMENTS WERE THERE. WHAT IS HAPPENING TONIGHT AND WHY MAY HE BE DECIDING TO GO FOR A GUILTY PLEA? >>? THE ASSISTANT DA WAS A HIGH PROFILE PROSECUTOR IN THE BOSTON YOU ATTORNEY'S OFFICE IN CHARGE OF HELP WITH THE PROSECUTION, AND SHE FILED A MOTION LATE TODAY THAT EFFECTIVELY SAYS IT IS WITH THE AGREEMENT THAT HE WANTS TO PLEAD GUILTY OR CHANGE OR ENTER A PLEA OF NO CONTEST, WHICH IS USUALLY NOT WHAT HAPPENS BUT IT'S USUALLY A GUILTY PLEA AND THAT COULD HAPPEN AS SOON AS MONDAY. THOUSANDS OF DOCUMENTS ALL PUT OUT ONLINE IN A CHAT FORUM CALLED DISCORD, AND THEY WERE TOP SECRET, SECRET AND PARTIALLY COME FRONT REALIZED -- COMPARTMENTALIZED. THERE IS A LOT OF INFORMATION. THERE IS A LOT OF INFORMATION PUT OUT THERE AT THE TIME AND INTELLIGENCE CAPABILITIES INVOLVING SOUTH KOREA AND ISRAEL. WE AREN'T EXACTLY TALKING ABOUT WHAT THE FRENCH PRIME MINISTER HAD FOR LUNCH BUT PRETTY SERIOUS STUFF. YOU MAY REMEMBER SHORTLY AFTER THIS ARREST, WHEN WE LOOK AT VIDEO FROM LAST APRIL- IT WAS MID MAY, TO ARRESTS BEING MADE BY SWAT LAST. THEN IT WAS: HIM ORDERED, DETAINED THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRETY OF THE TIME LEADING UP TO THIS TRIAL, WHICH, APPARENTLY, ONCE THE JUDGE AGREES TO THIS HEARING WON'T HAPPEN OR RESULT AND WHAT WILL BE A GUILTY PLEA >>. AND MORE BREAKING NEWS HERE. >>. AND MORE BREAKING NEWS HERE FROM CAPITOL HILL IN THE LAST HOUR OR SO, THE TRANSCRIPT FROM HUNTER BIDEN'S HOURS LONG CLOSED-DOOR MEETING- AND THIS IS SUCH A HIGH PROFILE MOMENT- AND AFTER REPUBLICANS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES ASKED HIM TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AND, BECAUSE OF THE INQUIRY, THEY ARE LAUNCHING INTO HIS DAD, THE PRESIDENT. WE HEARD A LOT FROM PEOPLE INSIDE THE ROOM AND THERE IS NOW A REALITY CHECK FROM THE WORDS SPOKEN IN THESE DOCUMENTS. AND HERE WE GO. AND CAPITOL HILL OVER THE PAST 20 MINUTES. OVER THE PAST 20 MINUTES, WE HEAR FROM HIS TEAM THAT WHAT WE ARE SEEING IS WHAT WE HAVE AND WHAT ARE WE LEARNING ABOUT IT >>. Reporter. THIS IS REMARKABLE THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO TURN THE TRANSCRIPT AROUND SO FAST AND, IN GENERAL, THE LEGAL TEAMS MADE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO THROUGH IT TO MAKE SURE EVERY SENTENCE IS ACCURATE AND EVERY IS IN THE RIGHT PLACE AND PUNCTUATION IS APPROPRIATE. IT ISN'T AN EASY TASK WITH A TRANSCRIPT OVER 200 PAGES. SO WE DO HAVE THE TEAM READING THREAT. RIGHT NOW, MY GENERAL SENSE FROM GETTING THROUGH IT IN THE LAST 25 MINUTES OR SO IS: THIS IS LARGELY WHAT WE EXPECTED AND THIS IS. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE PESTERING HUNTER BIDEN ABOUT HIS BUSINESS INTERACTIONS. ASKING THE VERY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS HE WAS A PART OF AND FINDING A WAY TO LINK THOSE TRANSACTIONS WITH HIS FATHER, EITHER THROUGH HIS BROTHER OR OTHER BUSINESS ASSOCIATES USING COMMUNICATION THAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED AND IT COULD VAGUELY BE CONNECTED TO HIS FATHER OR INSINUATING HIS FATHER WAS INVOLVED. EACH AND EVERY TIME HUNTER BIDEN IS ASKED ABOUT ANY SORT OF THAT AND HE WAS DENYING THAT HIS FATHER WAS INVOLVED. MOST OF THESE WITNESSES HAVE BACKED UP THOSE CLAIMS THAT HIS FATHER WAS NEVER INVOLVED IN HIS BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND SAVE FOR ONE SOMEBODY HUNTER BIDEN HAD AN HONOR OFF BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP WITH AND SOMEBODY EVENTUALLY FELL OUT WITH. AND NOW TONY HAS BECOME THE STAR WITNESS FOR REPUBLICANS WHO SPECIFICALLY SAID THAT HE THINKS THE PRESIDENT WAS INVOLVED IN HUNTER BIDEN'S BUSINESS DEALINGS, AND THIS IS WHAT HUNTER BIDEN SAID ABOUT THAT. THAT IS WHY I THINK TONY IS A BITTER BUT AMANDA DIDN'T GET IN ON A DEAL THAT HE WANTED TO GET IN ON BECAUSE I THOUGHT, AND THIS IS HUNTER BIDEN SPEAKING THAT HE WAS BOTH INCOMPETENT AND AN IDIOT, AND HE HAS PROVED HIMSELF TO BE SO BY THE COMPLETE MISSTATEMENT HE HAS MADE. THIS IS AN EFFORT BY HUNTER BIDEN TO TRULY UNDERMINE THE TESTIMONY OF THIS MAN AND SUGGEST VERY EARLY ON IN THE BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP THAT HE DEEMED HIM TO BE SOMEBODY NOT TRUSTWORTHY AND SORT OF ADMITS. IN THE DEPOSITION THAT HE BELIEVES HE WAS TRYING TO TRADE IN ON JOE BIDEN'S NAME BUT THAT WAS ONE OF THE REASONS HE DISASSOCIATED HIMSELF WITH HIM AND THE STATEMENTS THAT HE HAS MADE SINCE HER, NOT TO BE TRUSTED. AT LEAST, HUNTER BIDEN, TRUSTED AT LEAST HUNTER BIDEN SIDE OF THE STORY. AND THAT IS JUST SCRATCHING THE SURFACE OF THE SIX HOUR DEPOSITION WHICH WE ARE GETTING THE CHANCE TO READ: >> THE BIG PICTURE: WHAT IS IT MEAN FOR THE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY AGAINST PRESIDENT BIDEN? >>. I SPENT A GOOD PORTION OF TODAY TALKING TO REPUBLICANS, FIRST OF ALL ABOUT THE DEPOSITION AND ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY THINK THE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY COULD GO FORWARD. I DISCOVERED MANY OF THESE REPUBLICANS. SOME OF THEM WHO STAYED ON THESE COMMITTEES SAID THEY DON'T SEE VALUE IN BRINGING HUNTER BIDEN UP TO TESTIFY IN PUBLIC. THAT IS REMARKABLE, GIVEN HOW MUCH THEY INSISTED THAT HAPPEN SECONDLY MANY OF THE SAME REPUBLICANS, MANY OF WHOM BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT SHOULD BE IMPEACHED, BELIEVE IT HAS NO SHOT OF HAPPENING. THERE WERE THREE DIFFERENT REPUBLICANS I SPOKE TO TODAY WHO ALL SAID THEY DON'T INC THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN WILL EVER BE IMPEACHED, AND TWO OF THEM SAY THE VOTE WILL FAIL. AND ONE OF THEM SAID THEY SHOULDN'T EVEN GO FORWARD. AND THAT IS THE GROWING SENSE. YOU GET WITH THE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY STALLED AND NOTHING ABOUT THIS DEPOSITION THAT WILL CHANGE THAT. >>. THANK YOU, RYAN, FOR BRINGING US THAT LATE RAKING. DEVELOPMENT, DEVELOPMENT >>>. THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE BOY FIREWORKS FOR HIM, LAWMAKERS CONFRONTING HIM OVER WHY, WHEN HE HAD TREATMENT AND SURGERY FOR CANCER, WENT BACK IN THE HOSPITAL AND WHY DIDN'T HE TELL THE WHITE HOUSE FOR A FEW DAYS? >>. ARE YOU SURPRISED THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T CALL FOR YOUR RESIGNATION? >> I AM SURPRISED. >> HE IS EXPRESSED FULL FAITH AND CONFIDENCE IN ME. >>. THE BIG ISSUE IS THAT EITHER THE PRESIDENT IS THAT ALOOF OR YOU ARE IRRELEVANT. AND WHICH ONE IS IT? MR SECRETARY, YOU WOULD THINK THE PRESIDENT WOULD GO THREE DAYS WITHOUT THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE NOT ON THE JOB? >> IT IS NEITHER. >> SECRETARY AUSTIN WAS HOSPITALIZED AND TREATED FOR PROSTATE CANCER AND HE HAD A PROCEDURE BEFORE CHRISTMAS AND WENT ON NEW YEAR'S DAY, BECAUSE HE WAS IN PAIN AND GOING THROUGH ISSUES AND THE WHITE HOUSE WASN'T TOLD ABOUT THEM UNTIL JANUARY 4, THREE DAYS LATER, BUT THE DEFENSE SECRETARY IN AND OUT OF TREATMENT FACING QUESTION ABOUT HOW THIS COULD HAVE AFFECTED NATIONAL SECURITY. WE ARE LIVE FROM THE PENTAGON AND WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT A MONTH AND A HALF AGO. IT WAS HOW HE IS A VERY PRIVATE PERSON BUT THE POSITION HE IS IN TO SOME DEGREE THAT FORCES A LEVEL OF PUBLIC AWARENESS BECAUSE OF THIS ISSUE OF NATIONAL SECURITY RIGHT WALK US THROUGH. THAT BECAUSE IT CAME UP TODAY >>. YOU MAY REMEMBER, A FEW WEEKS AGO HE DID A BRIEFING HERE AT THE PENTAGON, WHERE HE DID TALK ABOUT WHEN HE GOT THAT DIAGNOSIS AND HE CALLED IT A GUT PUNCH AND HIS FIRST INCLINATION WAS TO KEEP IT QUIET AND HOLD THAT INFORMATION TIGHT AND HE DIDN'T WANT TO TELL ANYBODY ABOUT IT OR BURDEN ANYBODY IT. SORT OF A TWIST OF IRONY THAT HIS DECISION EARLY ON NOT TO TELL ANYBODY ABOUT IT HAS LED TO THIS MASSIVE AMOUNT OF DISCLOSURE HE HAD TO MAKE IN THE FORM OF BRIEFINGS AND NOW THIS TESTIFYING TODAY. BUT YOU ARE RIGHT. THE MAJOR POINT OF CONTENTION TODAY WAS EXACTLY WHY WAS IT THAT? NOT ONLY SECRETARY AUSTIN BUT HIS STAFF ALSO. WHY DID THEY NOT FEEL IT NECESSARY TO NOTIFY THE WHITE HOUSE AND PRESIDENT BIDEN OF HIS HOSPITALIZATION FOR THREE DAYS? WE DIDN'T REALLY GET AN ANSWER TO THAT AND THERE WAS A LOT OF FIERY BACK AND FORTH, LIKE WHAT WE JUST SHOWED. BUT WE HAD A VERY CONSISTENT MESSAGE FROM THE SECRETARY ACCEPTING RESPONSIBILITY AND ACKNOWLEDGING THE NOTIFICATION PROCESS WASN'T HANDLED CORRECTLY BUT ALSO REITERATING THAT THE COMMAND AND CONTROL HERE AT THE PENTAGON WAS NEVER IN JEOPARDY. AND HERE IS HOW HE SAID IT: >>. AGAIN, WE DIDN'T HANDLE THIS RIGHT AND I DIDN'T HANDLE IT RIGHT. AS YOU KNOW, I HAVE APOLOGIZE, INCLUDING DIRECTLY TO THE PRESIDENT, AND I TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY >>. Reporter. THE ONE THING THAT STOOD OUT TO ME IS TODAY. FOR THE FIRST TIME WE HEARD SECRETARY AUSTIN SAY THAT HE EXPECTED OR ASSUMED THAT HIS STAFF WOULD MAKE THE PROPER NOTIFICATIONS, INCLUDING TO THE AGENCIES AROUND TOWN. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY HE TOOK RESPONSIBILITY AND SAID: WE MADE MISTAKES. >> A LOT ON THAT FRONT AND THANK YOU SO MUCH. >> YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE THE MOMENT THAT THEY FACE A POTENTIAL SHUTDOWN FOR ANOTHER DAY. >>. ON THIS VOTE THE YESES OR 320 AND THE NOSE OR 99, 2/3 IN THE AFFIRMATIVE AND THE RULES ARE SUSPENDED IN THE BILL IS PASSED. >>. IN PLAIN ENGLISH, INHUMAN SPEAK. THAT IS THE HOUSE DECIDING WE ARE NOT TO DEAL WITH THIS TODAY AND PUSHING THE DEADLINE AGAIN. AND YOU SEE THE BIG EXES ON THE ORIGINAL DEADLINE, INCLUDING ONE OF THEM, TOMORROW AT MIDNIGHT. AND NOW WE TALK MARCH 8 AND MARCH 22, WHERE WE NEED TO SEE A LONGER-TERM DEAL, BUT THE HOUSE SPEAKER PROMISING TO SLASH THE BUDGET. >>. THE APPROPRIATIONS PROCESS IS UGLY AND DEMOCRACY IS UGLY, AND THIS IS THE WAY IT WORKS EVERY YEAR AND ALWAYS HAS. THERE WILL BE REAL CUTS TO NON DEFENSE, DISCRETIONARY SPENDING, BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT WE WILL ADHERE TO. >>. WE ARE LEARNING. IN FACT, THE SENATE WILL VOTE TONIGHT ON A SERIES OF THESE ESSENTIALLY CAN KICKING PLANS TO TRY TO EXTEND THESE DEADLINES AGAIN THROUGH MARCH 8 AND MARCH 22.. AND OF COURSE, BEFORE THAT DEADLINE, >> MORE TO COME, INCLUDING THOUSANDS OF DOCTORS FACING AN ULTIMATUM, AFTER GOING ON STRIKE, AND WHAT THE GOVERNMENT SAID COULD HAPPEN IF THEY DON'T BACK TO WORK. PLUS, ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S BIGGEST MOVIE CHAINS SAYS IS: >> WHAT AN INTERESTING LOOK AT THIS DEVELOPMENT. THANK YOU SO MUCH, APPRECIATE IT. >>. ONE OF THE FIVE THINGS WE THINK YOU SHOULD KNOW. ABOUT NUMBER ONE. WE TOLD YOU ABOUT THE POLICE LOCKDOWN IN ANNAPOLIS IN THE LAST HOUR OR SO, AND WE ARE LEARNING. IT WAS BECAUSE OF A THREAT THAT WAS FOUND IN WITH OFFICE IS EVACUATING THE BUILDING, BUT THEY SAY NOTHING HAS BEEN FOUND. NUMBER TO A NEW PROPOSAL FROM THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION WOULD MAKE IT EASIER FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO FINE AIRLINES ON HOW THEY HANDLE WHEELCHAIRS AND IT GIVES TRAINING EVERY YEAR TO AIRLINE WORKERS WHO HANDLE THEM, AND THEY SAY THEY MISHANDLE MORE THAN 11,000 WHEELCHAIRS AND COMPUTERS JUST LAST YEAR. THREE: NETFLIX MAY RAISE PRICES, ACCORDING TO ANALYSTS WATCHING. THE COMPANY BOOSTED THE PRICE OF ITS BASIC PLAN FROM $10 A MONTH FOR $12 LAST FALL AND NETFLIX HASN'T CONFIRMED THEY ARE HIKING PRICES, BUT EXECUTIVES SAY IT ISN'T OFF THE TABLE. NUMBER FOUR: CAITLIN CLARK HAS TAKEN HER TALENTS TO THE WNBA DRAFT IN A FEW MONTHS. I KNOW, YOU KNOW WHO SHE IS. SHE IS THE ALL-TIME WOMEN'S SCORE AND SHE COULD IN FACT BREAK THE MEN'S RECORD THIS WEEKEND AND SHE IS A. -- SAYS IT'S HARD TO EXPRESS HER GRATITUDE AND SHE IS ALREADY LEGEND AND IT WILL BE FUN TO WATCH HER PRO CAREER. NUMBER FIVE: YOU KNOW THAT ICONIC ADD REVENUE GROWTH WAS TAYLOR, SWIFT, BEYONCE AND THOSE CONCERT FILMS AND THEY SAID YOU CAN EXPECT MORE OF THAT TYPE IN THE YEARS TO COME >>. THERE IS A LOT OF AMC NEWS TONIGHT. >>> AN AMERICAN BALLERINA DETAINED IN RUSSIA AND HER BOYFRIEND AND WHAT HE SAYS. AND ONE CITY IN BOLIVIA IS THE MOON OR MARS AND FEELS LIKE WE ARE ON THE CUSP OF SOMETHING BIG >>>. NEW QUESTIONS TONIGHT ON THE CHAOTIC ATTACK AND MURDER IN GAZA, WITH AT LEAST 100 PEOPLE KILLED AND 700 MORE HER WHILE WAITING FOR FOOD, ACCORDING TO GAZA'S HEALTH MINISTRY. ISRAEL PUT OUT THIS VIDEO SHOWING THE ATTACK AND PANIC, AND THIS WAS SURROUNDING AND AID TRUCK WHEN GUNSHOTS WENT OFF. PRESIDENT BIDEN ACKNOWLEDGED THIS AND ACKNOWLEDGES THE HOSTAGES THAT NEED TO BE OUT >>. HOPE SPRINGS ETERNAL AND I WAS ON THE TELEPHONE WITH THE, WAS ON THE TELEPHONE WITH THE PEOPLE IN THE REGION AND I AM HOPEFUL. PROBABLY NOT BY MONDAY, BUT I AM HOPEFUL >>. WE ARE LIVE IN TEL AVIV. TELL US WHAT WE ARE LEARNING ABOUT THE ATTACK AND WHAT ISRAEL SAYS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED AND WHY THIS IS SO COMPLICATED TO BEGIN TO UNTANGLE >>. Reporter. ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS GIVING TWO VERY DIFFERENT ACCOUNTS. THIS MORNING, HUNDREDS OF PALESTINIANS GATHERED ON THIS STREET, THIS COASTAL ROAD IN GAZA CITY. THEY WERE WAITING AT AN AID DISTRIBUTION POINT, HOPING TO GET SOME FOOD AND FLOWER, AND THEY SAY, ONE IN FOUR OF THEM ARE A STEP AWAY FROM FAMINE. AT THIS POINT, AND A PALESTINIAN EYEWITNESS SAID ISRAELI FORCES AT A CHECK POINT STARTED SHOOTING AT THAT CROWD BEFORE ANY OF THE TRUCKS ARRIVED AND CONTINUED SHOOTING LATER AS THEY SURGED TOWARD THE TRUCK. AND THEY SAID THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY'S HAD SAID MORE THAN 100 PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND HOSPITALS FLOODED WITH GUNSHOT VICTIMS. AND THE ISRAELI MILITARY TELLING A DIFFERENT STORY. THEY SAY MOST OF THE DEAD WERE KILLED IN A STAMPEDE IN THE CHAOS SURROUNDING THE TRUCK AND SOME OF THEM MAY HAVE BEEN RUN OVER BY THE TRUCK. AND THEY SAY THEIR FORCES OPENED FIRE ONLY AT A VERY SPECIFIC GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO WOR -- WERE APPROACHING THREATENINGLY. I ASKED THEM IF THEY HAD ANY EVIDENCE OF THAT CLAIM AND ANY DRONE FITTED YOUR HEAD, CAM FOOTAGE, AND THEY SAID THEY HAD NOTHING TO PROVIDE. AT THIS POINT, YOU HEARD THE PRESIDENT SAY THAT HE FEARS, AND OTHERS FEAR THAT THIS WILL COMPLICATE WHAT WERE ALREADY VERY DIFFICULT CEASE-FIRE NEGOTIATIONS, AND NEGOTIATIONS AT THIS POINT APPEAR TO BE BASICALLY STALLED. AND IF THERE ARE ANY CALLS FOR OPTIMISM, RIGHT NOW, IT IS HERE. THIS LAST DEAL, BACK IN NOVEMBER, WAS ALSO NEGOTIATED DURING A PERIOD OF PRETTY INTENSE BLOODSHED IN GAZA, THAT THAT IS A MUCH BIGGER DEAL AND A MORE COMPLICATED DEAL, AND UNCLEAR RIGHT NOW IF THE TWO SIDES CAN COME TOGETHER AND GET IT DONE. >>. THANK YOU. >>>. THE RUSSIAN NOW WHERE A SIBERIAN COURT IS DENYING AN AMERICANS BALLERINAS APPEAL ON HER CHARGES OF TREASON. IT TURNS OUT. SHE WILL HAVE TO. IT TURNS OUT. SHE WILL HAVE TO STAY BEHIND BARS UNTIL AT LEAST. EARLY APRIL, SHE WAS ACCUSED OF TREASON FOR DONATING ABOUT $51 TO UKRAINE AND POSTING MESSAGES AGAINST THE WAR, ACCORDING TO RUSSIAN STATE MEDIA AND FACES UP TO 20 YEARS IN PRISON UNDER RUSSIAN LAW. >>. Reporter, YOU ARE HEARING FROM HER BOYFRIEND AND WHAT IS HE TELLING YOU? >>. Reporter. THIS IS ANOTHER DEPRESSING EXAMPLE OF HOW AN AMERICAN CITIZEN HELD IN RUSSIA AND SHE IS LEARNING TODAY THAT SHE WILL BE HELD FOR ANOTHER MONTH AND I SUSPECT GIVEN OTHER EXAMPLES. IT WILL BE LONGER THAN THAT, AND WE SPOKE TO HER BOYFRIEND TODAY AFTER THE DECISION THAT HER APPEAL WOULD BE REJECTED AND THAT IS WHY HE IS HAPPY TO COME TO TERMS WITH THIS AND TOLD US ABOUT HER CONDITION, WHERE SHE IS BEING HELD AND, FOR EXAMPLE, SHE IS ONLY ABLE TO SHOWER ONCE A WEEK. TAKE A LISTEN. >>. I KNEW THIS WOULD BE LIKE WE WOULD NEED A MIRACLE AND THAT SHE WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK THERE AND THAT IS PAINFUL- AND A $52.81 DONATION- AND I STILL CAN'T WRAP MY HEAD AROUND IT- AND FOR HER TO BE WHERE SHE HIS -- IS BECAUSE OF A SIMPLE DONATION, BECAUSE SHE IS KIND. I AM BATTLING TO UNDERSTAND THIS. >>. I ASKED HIM WHAT HIS MESSAGE WOULD BE TO PRESIDENT PUTIN. HE SAID SHE IS INNOCENT AND NOT A POLITICIAN AND SHE DOESN'T DESERVE TO BE IN PRISON. >>. IT IS HAPPENING ON THE SAME DAY AS PUTIN HIMSELF IS ISSUING THIS NEW WARNING, BECAUSE IT ECHOES WHAT HE HAS SAID FOR A LONG TIME: THAT HE WANTS THE WEST TO STAY OUT OF THE WAY OF HIS INVASION OF UKRAINE. >>. YES, SO THE PRESIDENT OF FRANCE SUGGESTED IN A SPEECH, AND SO DID OTHER PEOPLE, THAT THERE COULD BE NATO BOOTS ON THE GROUND INSIDE UKRAINE. BUT THERE IS NOW AN ARGUMENT BETWEEN GERMANY AND FRANCE AND THE UK AFTER THE GERMAN CHANCELLOR SUGGESTED THAT THERE WERE FRENCH AND BRITISH SOLDIERS IN UKRAINE ALREADY. AND THEN YOU HAVE PRESIDENT PUTIN TODAY WITH ALL OF THIS UNDERSCORING. I THINK FRANKLY WHAT, DIPLOMATICALLY, THE REAL MASSES IN UKRAINE RIGHT NOW AND JUST A WARNING OF A NUCLEAR WAR, IS WHAT THE FRENCH PRESIDENT SAID: MIGHT HAPPEN, DID, HAPPEN, AND NOW WE HAVE THE STATE DEPARTMENT WEIGHING IN: TAKE A LISTEN. >>. THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE THE SCENE- IRRESPONSIBLE RHETORIC FROM VLADIMIR PUTIN, AND IT'S NO WAY FOR THE LEADER OF A NUCLEAR ARMS STATE TO SPEAK. WE HAVE COMMUNICATED IN THE PAST, PRIVATELY AND DIRECTLY, WITH RUSSIA ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE USE OF A NUCLEAR WEAPON, AND THAT SAID: WE DON'T HAVE ANY SIGN THAT RUSSIA IS PREPARING TO USE A NUCLEAR WEAPON, AND WE WILL MONITOR THIS CAREFULLY. >>. PRESIDENT PUTIN, AND THAT SPEECH CELEBRATING, IF YOU LIKE, SUCCESS OF THE FRONT LINES, THAT OF HARDLY MOVED IN RECENT MONTHS, AND TALKING ABOUT RUSSIAN SOLDIERS GOING THROUGH- AND THIS IS HIS WORDS- GOING THROUGH THE WAR, AND ONCE UPON A TIME YOU WOULDN'T EVEN CALL IT THAT >> LIVE FROM LONDON, WITH A LOT OF NEWS TO COVER, THANK YOU. >>>. WE COVER HUNDREDS OF OTHER INTERNATIONAL STORIES EVERY DAY BECAUSE IT COULD BE HARD TO READ OR WATCH THE MALL. OUR TEAM HAS DONE IT FOR YOU, AND THIS IS A SEGMENT. WE CALL THE GLOBAL IN BOLIVIA, DEADLY FLOODS KILLING 40 PEOPLE, FORCING HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE TO EVACUATE THIS AREA, AND YOU SEE IT HERE IN THE AMAZON, WITH DOZENS OF HOMES UNDERWATER AND PEOPLE USING BOATS TO GET AROUND AND SOME PEOPLE RUNNING INTO TROUBLE, BECAUSE THE INTERNATIONAL BRIDGE BETWEEN BOLIVIA AND BRAZIL IS NEARLY COVERED WITH WATER FROM A NEARBY RIVER AND OUT OF SOUTH KOREA. IT IS FRIDAY MORNING. WHICH MEANS IT IS PASSED A. WHICH MEANS IT IS PASSED A GOVERNMENT DEADLINE FOR DOCTORS TO GO BACK TO WORK AND IF THEY DON'T SHOW UP, THE MEDICAL LICENSES COULD BE SUSPENDED OR THEY COULD FACE PROSECUTION AS SOON AS NEXT WEEK. WE TOLD YOU ABOUT MEDICAL RESIDENTS WHO WALKED OFF THE JOB MORE THAN A WEEK AGO PROTESTING THE GOVERNMENT'S PUSH TO BOOST ENROLLMENT. AND POPE FRANCIS IS BACK IN MEETINGS TODAY AFTER SOME MEDICAL TESTS YESTERDAY, AND HE HAS BEEN DEALING WITH THE FLU AND ITS'S BUSIEST TIME OF YEAR AND ONLY A MONTH AWAY AND COMING UP, A SHOOTING INVESTIGATION SHOWS HOW DANGEROUS THESE SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS CAN BE FOR KIDS. BUT THE REPORTER BEHIND THE STORY >>>. TIME NOW TO GET THE BACK STORY AND A BEHIND-THE-SCENES LOOK ON HOW A STORY COMES TOGETHER AND HOW IT FITS IN THE BIGGER PICTURE. TONIGHT WE LOOK AT A HUGE INVESTIGATION FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES ABOUT A YOUNG GIRL INFLUENCER WITH SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS MANAGED BY THE PARENTS AND ALSO APPARENTLY DRAWING PEDOPHILES, AND ON SOME OF THESE PARENTS ENCOURAGE MALE ADMIRERS AND SOMETIMES EVEN SELL THOSE PICTURES. IT SPEAKS TO HOW DANGEROUS THE WORLD OF CHILD INFLUENCING CAN BE AT A TIME WHEN ONE THIRD OF PRETEENS WANT TO BE INFLUENCERS. META DID TELL US THAT PARENTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACCOUNTS AND CONTENT AND CAN DELETE THEM ANYTIME. LET'S BRING IN JENNIFER, A NEW YORK TIMES REPORTER, AND WE ARE GLAD TO HAVE YOU ON ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE DEPTH OF WHAT YOU REPORTED, WITH YOU AND THE TEAM LOOKING AT THOUSANDS OF ACCOUNTS, AND AT ONE POINT, YOU RIGHT IT SHOWS, DISTURBING INSIGHTS INTO HOW SOCIAL MEDIA IS RESHAPING CHILDHOOD, ESPECIALLY FOR GIRLS, WITH DIRECT PARENTAL ENCOURAGEMENT, DIRECT PARENTAL ENCOURAGEMENT AND INVOLVEMENT, AND THIS IS A HUGE INVESTIGATION. SO WHERE DID THE REPORTING START FOR YOU AND WHERE WAS THE IMPETUS? >>. UNBELIEVABLY, THIS STARTED BEFORE THE PANDEMIC, AND MY COLLEAGUE AND I WERE LOOKING INTO HOW SOCIAL MEDIA COULD BE AFFECTING YOUNG GIRLS, AND WE STARTED DOING SEARCHES ON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS WITH THINGS LIKE TEEN INFLUENCERS AND HOW THIS MASSIVE, EXPANDING INFLUENCE CULTURE COULD BE TRICKLING DOWN TO THE YOUNGER SET. WE WERE FINDING ALL OF THESE ACCOUNTS THAT WERE RUN BY PARENTS. I HAD NO IDEA, UNTIL WE LOOKED AT THIS, THAT THERE COULD EVEN BE SUCH A THING, AND WE PITCHED THIS STORY, AND I WAS LOOKING AT ONE OF OUR PITCHES AND IT WAS IN JANUARY OR FEBRUARY 2020, AND I THINK WE ALL KNOW WHAT HAPPENED IMMEDIATELY AFTER THAT. THERE WAS A LOT OF NEWS IN THE MEANTIME AND FINALLY, WE PICKED IT UP AGAIN LAST YEAR AND LOOKED INTO THIS BECAUSE WE FELT IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT >>. IT'S INCREDIBLE TO HEAR HOW LONG THIS IS IN THE WORKS AND HOW DID YOU KEEP TRACK? THERE WERE A LOT OF INTERVIEWS AND A LOT OF BACKGROUND YOU HAD TO GATHER AND A LOT OF MATERIAL >>. IT WAS A MASSIVE UNDERTAKING. WE USED A LOT OF GOOGLE SPREADSHEETS AND A LOT OF FILE FOLDERS ON THE COMPUTER AND I THINK THAT WAS ONE OF THE BIG TESTS WE HAD OF KEEPING DISORGANIZED, WHICH WAS IMPORTANT FOR US TO GET THE FULL SCOPE OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING. RATHER THAN, JUST TRY TO RELY ON TALKING TO A FEW PEOPLE >>. YOU TALK ABOUT THESE CONVERSATIONS AND I KNOW YOU TALK TO PARENTS WHO RUN THESE ACCOUNTS- AND ONE MOM TOLD YOU AND A COMMENT AND SHE SAID SHE SAID A PACK OF MONSTERS AND SAID HER DAUGHTER HAS WRITTEN HER SELF OFTEN DECIDED THE ONLY WAY SHE IS GOING TO HAVE A FUTURE IS TO MAKE A MINT ON THIS AND HAS WAY MORE TO OFFER. AND THAT IS A QUOTE. AND WAS AT A COMMENT LIKE THAT THE SUPPOSED -- SURPRISED YOU MOST OR ANYTHING THAT SHOCK TO YOU >>. I THINK A LOT OF THIS WAS SURPRISING. I THINK THAT WAS SOME OF IT. SHE WASN'T AT ALL THE ONLY PARENT WHO HAD BEEN DOING THIS FOR SOME TIME WHO EXPRESSED SOME SORT OF REGRET, OR AT LEAST FOR WHAT PART OF WHAT HAPPENED, AND THEY SAID NOW THAT THEY HAD BEEN THROUGH THIS. THEY DIDN'T THINK THAT CHILDREN SHOULD BE ON SOCIAL MEDIA IN THIS WAY AT ALL ALL. I DO THINK THAT I WAS SURPRISED THAT, HONESTLY, THERE ARE STILL ACCOUNTS LIKE THIS BEING OPENED ALL THE TIME AND DO SOMETHING TO KEEP TRACK OF NEW ACCOUNTS AND PEOPLE COMING INTO THIS WORLD. I THINK A LOT OF PARENTS THINK I THINK A LOT OF PARENTS THINK THEY GO INTO THIS AND THAT INFLUENCER CULTURE IS REALLY NORMALIZED, ESPECIALLY WITH GENERATION Z, AND I THINK SOME PEOPLE ARE REALLY JUST NOT AWARE OF HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO KEEP KIDS SAFE ON THESE PLATFORMS >>. THAT BRINGS US TO THE ACCOUNTABILITY FACTOR, BUT NOT JUST WITH THE PARENTS, BUT THE COMPANIES, AND I THINK THAT IS A HUGE PART OF THIS. DID YOU FIND, IF YOU ARE TRYING TO GET ANSWERS ON THAT FRONT, THAT COMPANIES WERE RESPONSIVE, OR THE PARENTS, TO YOUR QUESTIONS, QUESTIONS >>. THE LARGEST PLAYER IS META-, BECAUSE WHAT WE FOUND IS MOSTLY ON INSTAGRAM- THIS PARTICULAR WORD -- WORLD, BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE THE BRAND IS AND THEY ARE REPRESENTATIVE FOR BRANDS THAT MAKE THINGS LIKE LEOTARD AND CHILDREN'S DANCE OUTFIT. THOSE PLAYERS REALLY WANT TO BE ON INSTAGRAM BECAUSE THAT IS EASIER FOR THEM. I THINK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE BRANDS AND WITH META- THEIR RESPONSE WAS NOT ENTIRELY SATISFYING. SOME BRANDS REALLY WORKED TO KEEP THEIR FOLLOWERS CLEAN AND HAD A HARD TIME BUT SOMETIMES THEY THREW THEIR HANDS IN THE AIR AND THEY FOUND IT DIFFICULT. >>. JENNIFER, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR GIVING US A LOOK BEHIND THE SCENES AT WHAT GOES INTO A PIECE LIKE THAT AND ONE. I ENCOURAGE FOLKS TO READ ON THE SITE: THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US. >>>. A LOT MORE TO COME, INCLUDING EVERYTHING YOU WANTED TO KNOW, BUT WERE TERRIFIED TO ASK ABOUT WHY TODAY IS ACTUALLY FEBRUARY 29? WHAT, WHAT STAY WITH US IS NBC NEWS NOW >>>. IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED, IT IS LEAP DAY AND THERE IS A LOT OF SCIENCE AND HISTORY TO THIS. ARE YOU CURIOUS? WE EXPLAIN WHY THE WORLD WOULD LOOK AND FEEL DIFFERENT WITHOUT IT >>. IT IS LEAP DAY, THAT EXTRA DAY IN FEBRUARY THAT LANDS ON OUR CALENDARS ONCE EVERY FOUR YEARS, WHICH MEANS DEALS ON DONUTS AND FAST FOOD AND COMMEMORATES THE LIFE OF THE SAINT OSWALD, WHO DIED ABOUT 1000 YEARS AGO AND FAMOUS FOR BUILDING MONASTERIES, AND WE TAKE IT. YOU KNOW ABOUT THE EARTH'S ANNUAL TRIP AROUND THE SUN AND TAKES A YEAR. RIGHT, IT REALLY TAKES 365 AND ONE QUARTER DAYS. YOU ARE STARTING TO THINK. COME ON, NOBODY SAID ANYTHING ABOUT MATH WELL TOUGH. THE TRIP TAKES 365 DAYS, FIVE HOURS, 48 MINUTES AND 46 SECONDS. IF WE DIDN'T ADD A DAY EVERY FOUR YEARS, AFTER A HALF-DOZEN CENTURIES, OR SO SUMMERWOOD TURN INTO WINTER AND WINTER WOULD TURN IN THE SUMMER GIVEN -- GIVING A WHOLE NEW MEANING TO CHRISTMAS. IN JULY, WHEN THEY STARTED DIVIDING THE YEAR, THEY ADDED THE FIVE EXTRA DAYS. ONTO, THE END OF THE YEAR IS FIVE DAYS OF FESTIVALS AND PARTY ON PHARAOH. BUT SERIOUSLY, TO BE A LEAP YEAR, THE NUMBER MUST BE DIVISIBLE BY FOUR. BUT THAT 365, DAY, FIVE HOUR, 48 MINUTES, 46 SECONDS TIMES FOR -- FOUR ONLY ADDS UP TO AN EXTRA 23.2 HOURS AND NOT A FULL 24. SO WHAT IS THE WORLD TO DO, AS ALL OF THOSE LEAP DAYS PILE UP AND WE OCCASIONALLY TAKE OUT SOME LEAP DAYS AND WE ONLY GET A LEAP DAY AT THE END OF CENTURY YEARS THAT ARE DIVISIBLE BY 400. SO THE YEAR 2000 WAS A LEAP YEAR, BUT THE YEAR 1900 WASN'T GOT IT ME EITHER. FOR ALL OF YOU CELEBRATING FEBRUARY 29 IS YOUR BIRTH DATE. YOU ARE SPECIAL AND THINK OF IT THIS WAY: ALL OF THE KIDS YOU WENT TO SCHOOL WITH, AND KIDS FROM YOUR GRADE. WHEN THEY TURN 100, YOU WILL BE 25, GIVE OR TAKE A FEW MINUTES >>. OUR THANKS TO HARRY SMITH FOR THAT WHEN AND WE HAVE MORE COVERAGE PICKING UP RIGHT NOW.",[52]
273,UXsJkyMYAKc,Meet the Press NOW â€” Feb. 28,NBC News,2024-02-28 23:45:02+00:00,"SO LET'S TAKE THIS ON TOGETHER â™ª. >>>. IF IT IS WEDNESDAY, THERE >>>. IF IT IS WEDNESDAY, THERE IS A SHAKE UP IN CONGRESS AND MITCH McCONNELL ANNOUNCES HE WILL BE STEPPING ASIDE AND HIS MESSAGE THAT IT IS TIME FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF LEADERSHIP IN AMERICAN POLITICS, PLUS A MAJOR MOVEMENT FOR THE PRESIDENTS REELECTION CAMPAIGN WITH MORE THAN 100,000 DEMOCRATS IN THE MUST WIN STATE OF MICHIGAN VOTING AGAINST IN THE LAST NIGHT'S PRIMARY, AND THE PRESIDENTS SON DELIVERS DEFIANT TESTIMONY BEHIND CLOSED DOORS IN THE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY, TELLING REPUBLICANS HIS FATHER WAS NEVER INVOLVED IN. FATHER WAS NEVER INVOLVED IN ANY OF HIS BUSINESSES. >>>. WELCOME TO MEET THE PRESS NOW. I AM KRISTEN WELKER, COMING TO YOU FROM A BUSY DAY AND WE HAVE NEW REACTION FROM THE PRIMARY ELECTION IN MICHIGAN WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR BOTH FRONT RUNNERS. AND WE HAVE BREAKING NEWS HERE IN WASHINGTON WITH SENATE MINORITY LEADER MITCH McCONNELL, THE LONGEST-SERVING LEADER IN SENATE HISTORY, ANNOUNCING TODAY HE IS LEAVING LEADERSHIP, WITH HIS FINAL YEAR FOR THE REPUBLICAN CONFERENCE. THE 82-YEAR-OLD CITED HIS AGE WHILE ANNOUNCING HIS DECISION ON THE SENATE FLOOR A FEW HOURS AGO. >>. I STAND BEFORE YOU TODAY, MR PRESIDENT, AND SAY THIS WILL BE MY LAST TERM AS REPUBLICAN LEADER OF THE SENATE FATHER. TIME REMAINS UNDEFEATED. I AM NO LONGER. THE YOUNG MAN SITTING HOPING COLLEAGUES WILL REMEMBER MY NAME AND IT IS TIME FOR THE NEXT GENERATION, THE NEXT GENERATION OF LEADERSHIP. >>. AN EMOTIONAL MOMENT. HIS DECISION COMES AFTER. HE CLASHED WITH THE FORMER PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS OF THE CONFERENCE OVER SUPPORT FOR UKRAINE IN THE CHAMBER BIPARTISAN BORDER DEAL. IN THE NEXT LEADERSHIP TEAM WILL ALMOST, CERTAINLY, BE LOYAL TO THE TRUMP WING OF THE PARTY AND MITCH McCONNELL THINGS TO ACKNOWLEDGE A BIT OF THAT REALITY. >>. BELIEVE ME, I KNOW THE POLITICS WITHIN MY PARTY AT THIS MOMENT, THIS MOMENT. I HAVE MANY FAULTS AND THESE TYPES OF POLITICS ISN'T ONE OF THEM. >>. HE SPENT NEARLY 40 YEARS IN THE SENATE, INCLUDING THE LAST 17 OF THAT, AS CONFERENCE LEADER, AND HIS DEPARTURE WILL MARC A CHANGE IN THE SENATE. AND A FEW MOMENTS AGO, PRESIDENT BIDEN, WHO SERVED WITH HIM SAID. HE IS SERVED WITH HIM SAID. HE IS TIRED. -- SORRY TO SEE HIM GO. >> HE HAS NEVER, NEVER, MISREPRESENTED --. >>. WE ARE JOINED NOW ON CAPITOL HILL. TAKE US BEHIND THE SCENES. AND WHY DID MITCH McCONNELL MAKE THIS DECISION? NOW IS IT ALL ABOUT HIS AGE AND IS AT ABOUT 2024, AS WELL WE KNOW. HE IS CLASHED WITH DONALD TRUMP. >>. ALL OF THE ABOVE. IT WAS A BLEND OF FACTORS AND A LONG, ANTICIPATED DECISION AND EVERYTHING WAS A FACTOR. AND HE IS 82, AS YOU POINTED OUT, AND HE WAS FIRST ELECTED TO THE SENATE 40 YEARS AGO AND HE IS ALREADY THE LONGEST-SERVING SENATE LEADER IN AMERICAN HISTORY AND NATURALLY THAT WEIGHED ON HIM AND THERE WERE HEALTH CONCERNS THAT HE DEALT WITH EARLIER THIS YEAR AND A VERY FEW HIGH PROFILE FREEZE UPS ON CAMERA AND MANY OF US WHO HAVE BEEN COVERING HIM FOR YEARS. HEALTH WAS IN A CONCERN EVEN AS HE WAS GETTING UP THERE IN AGE BUT ALSO THE POLITICS NO DOUBT HAD AN INFLUENCE ON THIS DONALD TRUMP INFLUENCE WITHIN THE SENATE REPUBLICAN CONFERENCE HAS GROWN SINCE HE LEFT OFFICE AND HE HAD A VERY LEFT OFFICE AND HE HAD A VERY PUBLIC AND SOMEWHAT NASTY BREAK WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP AFTER THE JANUARY 6 ATTACK AND HE GAVE A SPEECH ON THE FLOOR HOLDING HIM PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT AND THE TWO MEN HAVEN'T SPOKEN IN A FEW YEARS. IT WAS THAT FACTOR THAT EMBOLDENED THE CRITICS OF MITCH McCONNELL AND DIMINISHED SOME OF THAT GRIP THAT HE USED TO HAVE OVER HIS PARTY WITH THE UKRAINE AID BECOMING THE MOST FUNDED AND A RECENT DEAL HE NEGOTIATED AND HELPED TO WRITE ONLY GOT FOUR VOTES. AND THAT WAS A FEW YEARS AGO AND IT SHOWS THE SENATE REPUBLICAN CONFERENCE IS MOVING FURTHER AND FURTHER TO TRUMP'S DIRECTION >>. WHAT IS NOTABLE, OF COURSE, IS FORMER. PRESIDENT TRUMP WINS REELECTION AND HE WOULD BE TAKING THE REINS AT A TIME WHEN. OF COURSE, HE IS DEALING WITH A SENATE THAT IS MORE WILLING TO WORK WITH HIM ON HIS PRIORITIES, WORK WITH HIM ON HIS PRIORITIES BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, IF PRESIDENT BIDEN WINS REELECTION, HE WOULD BE A REAL ALLY. WHAT DOES A POST? MITCH McCONNELL SENATE LEADERSHIP LOOK LIKE >>. PERSONALLY, I THINK YOU HAVE DIFFERENT PEOPLE IN THE WHITE HOUSE DESCRIBE DIFFERENTLY WHETHER HE IS AN ALLY BUT THEY SEE HIM THAT WAY ON MATTERS OF GOVERNMENT, FUNDING AND THINGS LIKE THE DEBT LIMIT AND FUNCTIONS OF GOVERNMENT BUT HE HAS BEEN A THORN IN THE SIDE AND A WHOLE HOST OF OTHER ISSUES. SO WE DID HAVE A COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIP WITH DEMOCRATS AND, OF COURSE, INCREASINGLY COMPLICATED WITHIN HIS OWN PARTY. AND WHAT IS THE FUTURE LOOK LIKE? IT IS ALMOST CERTAIN IT WILL BE MORE PRO TRUMP AND FURTHER IN THE MOLD OF TRUMP AND PROBABLY WILL HAVE TO KISS THE RING TO SOME DEGREE TO GET THE SUPPORT OF THE CONFERENCE. AND THAT'S THE WAY TRENDS ARE MOVING IN. THERE ARE SEVERAL CANDIDATES WHO ARE ALREADY BEING DISCUSSED, AND THE SO-CALLED THREE JOHN'S. THEY EITHER CURRENTLY SERVE A PREVIOUSLY SERVED, AND THEY ARE SEEN AS THE FRONT RUNNERS AND THEY WILL BE JOCKEYING AGAINST VERY QUICKLY, AS EARLY AS TOMORROW, I THINK THEY WILL. BUT THESE MEN HAVE BEEN IN THE BACKGROUND OF THE WOULD-BE SUCCESSORS IF AND WHEN HE DID CHOOSE TO STEP DOWN AND THERE IS A POSSIBILITY OF AN OUTSIDER PICK SOMEBODY, LIKE RICK SCOTT WHO CHALLENGED HIM AND LOST LAST TIME AROUND, AND HE IS UNLIKELY TO WIN. BUT DEPENDING ON WHICH WAY THE POLITICAL WIND BLOWS, I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF THERE ARE SOME SURPRISES. >>. WE KNOW THAT. YOU WILL WATCH IT CLOSELY AND THANK YOU FOR ALL OF YOUR GREAT REPORTING, AND WE APPRECIATE THAT. >>. WE WANT TO TURNOUT OR OTHER TOP STORY WE TALKED ABOUT, WHICH IS THE FALLOUT FROM LAST NIGHT'S MICHIGAN PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY, WHICH HAS MOVED THE RACE CLOSER TOWARD A REMATCH. THIS NOVEMBER, MR TRUMP GOT ANOTHER VICTORY AGAINST NIKKI HALEY, SLIPPING EVERY ONE OF MICHIGAN'S COUNTIES, AND PRESIDENT BIDEN ROLLED TO ANOTHER VICTORY BUT ANY POTENTIAL WARNING SIGN FOR HIM, WITH 100,000 MICHIGANDERS SHOWING UP TO VOTE AGAINST THE PRESIDENT AND HIS HANDLING OF THE ISRAEL HAMAS WAR AND IT LEAVES, SOME OF THE ALLIES OF THE PRESIDENT CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT THESE COULD MEAN FOR NOVEMBER >>. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THEY ARE PERSUADED TO JOIN US AND WE NEED IT FOR A VICTORY. AND AS SOON AS IT COMES, AND THE SOONER THE RELIEF IS DELIVERED, THE THE RELIEF IS DELIVERED, THE SOONER WE WILL SEE PEOPLE TAKING STOCK OF WHAT THE REAL CHOICES ARE >>. I AM DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE SELECTION AND WORKING TOGETHER ON THESE COALITIONS, BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AND MAKE SURE WE ARE UNIFIED. WE CAN TAKE NOTHING FOR GRANTED. >>. THIS IS OUTSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE AND WE ARE ON THE GROUND IN GRAND RAPIDS, AND I WILL START WITH YOU. MORE THAN 100,000 DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY VOTERS IN MICHIGAN CHOSE TO VOTE UNCOMMITTED, WHICH CHOSE TO VOTE UNCOMMITTED, WHICH WAS IN A SURPRISE, AND THE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR WERE BRACING FOR THESE TYPES OF MARGINS. BUT DO TAKE US INSIDE SOME OF THESE CONVERSATIONS AND HOW IS THE PRESIDENT AND HIS ALLIES AND HOW ARE THEY RESPONDING AND HOW WORRIED ARE THEY? >>. THEY WERE EXPECTING THIS, BUT IT COMES WITH A SOBERING WARNING ABOUT WHAT THIS MOVEMENT CAN TURN INTO. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT NOVEMBER AND WHEN WE LOOK AT OTHER KEY BATTLEGROUND STATES AND SPECIFICALLY THIS QUESTION OF YOUNG VOTERS, WHICH IS SOMETHING THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN KNOWS AND IS KEENLY AWARE OF HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS, AND NEEDING TO MEET THEM WHERE THEY ARE, IN TERMS OF TRYING TO COMMUNICATE, BUT THE PRESIDENT DOES UNDERSTAND AND HE SAYS IN THE WHITE HOUSE, SAYS THAT THEY REALLY FEEL, OF COURSE, THESE PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO HAVE THEIR VOICES HEARD. BUT OFFICIALS DO REALLY BELIEVE THAT THESE VOTERS WILL SHOW UP FOR THE PRESIDENT IN NOVEMBER- AND THIS IS A TEMPORARY AND MOMENTARY EXPRESSION OF THIS DISPLEASURE. WHEN IT COMES TO IT AND COMES DOWN TO POTENTIALLY VOTING FOR SOMEBODY IN NOVEMBER, THAT COULD HELP PRESIDENT TRUMP BE THE FRONT RUNNER. IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT, REALLY, THOSE WHO VOTED FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN DID IN 2020 ARE WILLING TO DO- AND THIS IS A GAMBLE BUT THEY ARE TRYING TO WALK THIS FINE LINE AND THEY DON'T WANT TO DISCREDIT THIS. AND THEY WANT TO SAY WE UNDERSTAND. AND OFFICIALS SAY THEY WILL CONTINUE TO TRAVEL TO MICHIGAN TO HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS WITH ARAB- AMERICANS AND MUSLIM COMMUNITY LEADERS TO CONTINUE THIS BUT, OF COURSE, THERE IS SO MUCH PRESSURE ON THE POLICY SIDE OF THIS TO SEE IF ANYTHING SHIFTS >>. THERE REALLY IS A LOT OF PRESSURE AND THAT IS THE NAME OF THE GAME, AND THIS IS WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT. LET'S TURN TO YOU ON THIS POINT. I KNOW YOU ARE TALKING TO SOME OF THESE PEOPLE AND WHAT ARE THEY TELLING YOU? THEY FEEL LIKE THEY ACCOMPLISHED WHAT THEY WERE HOPING TO WITH THESE 100,000 VOTES, MAKING THE CASE THAT WE NEED THIS IN ORDER TO GET THE STATE >>. THEY ARE REALLY CELEBRATING WHAT WE SAW OUT OF MICHIGAN AND THEY HAD A PRESS CONFERENCE EARLIER TODAY AND THEY SAID THEY HAVE ALREADY BEEN REACHING OUT TO ORGANIZERS AND OTHER STATES AND AN UPCOMING PRIMARY CONTEST. SO LET'S BE CLEAR THAT RESIDENT BIDEN HAD A CLEAR AND CONVINCING WIN IN THE STATE OF MICHIGAN AND GOT EVERY COUNTY IN THE STATE AND GOT MORE THAN 80% OF THE VOTE WHILE. THAT IS TRUE. IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT THEY BELIEVE THE UNCOMMITTED ORGANIZATION, FEEL THAT THEY OVER PERFORMED AND THEY BEAT OUT. WHAT THEY SAID WERE THEIR EXPECTATIONS AND TALKED ABOUT THE LOW BUDGET AND THEIR RELIANCE ON VOLUNTEERS AND THE FACT THAT THEY WERE STANDING OUTSIDE OF PLACES LIKE DANCE CLUBS AND COSTS GO TO GET THE WORLD OUT -- WORD OUT. I WANT YOU TO LISTEN TO THE MAYOR OF DEARBORN AND LISTEN HOW HE HAS BEEN FRAMING WHAT THEY DID YESTERDAY. THEY DID YESTERDAY >>. WE DID OUR PART AND WE DEMONSTRATED. THIS IS A CORE ISSUE THAT WE CARE ABOUT AND WILL BRING TO THE BALLOT BOX IN NOVEMBER AND IT'S INCUMBENT TO DETERMINE: WILL HE CONTINUE TO ALIGN HIMSELF AND SUPPORT THE PRIME MINISTER OF ISRAEL OR CHOOSE JUSTICE AND DEMOCRACY AND HELP PREVENT THE UNRAVELING OF OUR GOVERNMENT HERE IN AMERICA. >>. Reporter. IF YOU LISTEN CLOSELY, HE ALMOST IS EXTENDING SOMEWHAT OF AN OLIVE BRANCH BUT THEY ARE SAYING THEY WANT TO SEE CHANGE IF BIDEN. ONCE THE VOTE. >> JUST UP FOLLOW-UP. WHERE IS THE MOVEMENT GOING FROM HERE? >>. Reporter POINTING TO SOME OTHER STATES BUT THEY ASKED ABOUT THE GENERAL ELECTION. AND WHAT DOES THAT SIGNIFY? MAYBE BECAUSE THERE IS TIME HERE AND HERE, WITH PEOPLE WHO VOTED UNCOMMITTED. SOME OF THEM SAY YES, ALL HOSTS -- HOPE IS LOST FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN. BUT OTHERS SAY WE WANT TO SEE A CEASE-FIRE AND FEEL THAT OUR POSITION IS HEARD. SO WHEN YOU SEE THE 1000 VOTES, MARC IT. SEE THE 1000 VOTES, MARC IT DOESN'T MEAN ONE -- THOSE FOR BIDEN. BUT IT DOES STILL SHOW IS A WARNING SIGN AND MORE WORK THEY WANT TO BE DONE BY THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN >>. EVERYBODY WILL BE WATCHING CLOSELY TO SEE IF THERE IS ANY POLICY CHANGE. LET ME GO BACK TO YOU, MONICA. YOU HAVE THESE RESULTS IN MICHIGAN AND THERE WAS NEWS TODAY THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN HAD HIS PHYSICAL. AND WE ARE GETTING HIS PHYSICAL AND WE ARE GETTING A FEW DETAILS ABOUT THAT. AND WHAT CAN YOU TELL US SO FAR? >>. THIS IS SOMETHING THE PRESIDENT COMMITTED TO DO AND HE PLEDGED TRANSPARENCY AND HE SAID THAT REALLY NOTHING HAS CHANGED FROM LAST YEAR AND HIS DOCTOR WILL BE PUTTING OUT A SUMMARY THAT WILL BE PUT OUT WIDELY. BUT TODAY WAS A PERSONAL PHYSICAL. THE LAST TIME HE DID A COMPLETE PHYSICAL WAS IN LATE 2021, IN THAT HAD A COLONOSCOPY AND WAS UNDER ANESTHESIA AND TRANSFERRED AUTHORITY TO THE VICE PRESIDENT. THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN. TODAY. THIS IS MORE ROUTINE. AND WAS MEETING WITH SPECIALIST BUT NOTABLY IN THE PRESS BRIEFING REPORTERS WERE ASKING: WAS THERE ANY COGNITIVE TESTING OR ANYTHING TO DO WITH MENTAL ACUITY AND THINGS LIKE THE SPECIAL COUNSEL'S REPORT ABOUT MEMORY AND RECALL? AND THEN THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY SAID: THERE WASN'T ANY COGNITIVE TESTS, BECAUSE HIS DOCTOR DETERMINED HE DIDN'T NEED ONE. DETERMINED, HE DIDN'T NEED ONE- ALONG WITH HIS NEUROLOGIST >>. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND WE APPRECIATE THAT. JOINING ME NOW AND SET TO DISCUSS ALL OF THE BIG STORIES AND POLITICS IS OUR CHIEF POLITICAL ANALYST, CHUCK TODD. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. LET'S START OFF BY TALKING ABOUT MICHIGAN, AND YOU COULD ARGUE. THERE ARE WARNING SIGNS IN MICHIGAN. LET'S TALK ABOUT DEMOCRATS, BECAUSE AND YOU HAVE THESE 100,000 UNCOMMITTED VOTES- AND WE SPOKE ABOUT THIS EARLIER- AND YOU ARE WATCHING TO SEE IF IT GOT TO 30% AND IT DID NOT GET THAT HIGH BUT NOT INSIGNIFICANT >>. YES, I THINK IT REALLY DEPENDS. IF YOU PORTRAYED IT AS 100,000, IT SEEMS SIGNIFICANT. THEN IF YOU SAID, THEY DIDN'T GET A SINGLE DELICATE OR MAKE THE THRESHOLD OF 15%. SO A LOT OF IT HAS TO DO WITH. I DON'T WANT TO TAKE ANYTHING AWAY FROM THE ACTIVISTS AND THEIR PASSION IN THE MESSAGE THEY ARE SENDING, BUT IF YOU ARE THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN AND LOOKING AT THIS, THIS COULD BE A LOT WORSE. THIS WAS A FREE VOTE AND THE ORGANIZATION WAS HELPING AND I ORGANIZATION WAS HELPING AND I DO LOOK AT THIS. SOMEWHAT INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT THAT THE PROTESTERS GOT INCLUDING FROM PROTESTERS GOT INCLUDING FROM ONE NEWS ORGANIZATION. I THINK TO A CERTAIN COMMUNITY. THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT BUT I THINK IT IS CONTAINED AS A POLITICAL PROBLEM. I LOOK AT IT. THE SAME WAY I LOOK AT THE NEW HAMPSHIRE. RIGHT AND EFFORTS IN ALL THE INGREDIENTS WERE THERE AND EVERYTHING IN MICHIGAN WAS THEY ARE, AND JUST THE OPPOSITE. NOT ONLY DID THEY CONTAIN IT, BUT THEY SHOWED MORE STRENGTH THAN I DID THINK. SO I DON'T WANT TO SAY THE PROTEST MOVEMENT CAME UP SHORT, BUT I DO THINK THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN PEOPLE. THIS MAY BE AN ISSUE, BUT IT IS A SMALLER GROUP THAN. I THINK MANY PEOPLE REALIZED. >> THEY DIDN'T NEED THAT 30%, MARC MARC >> WE HAVE SEEN 20% IN THE PAST AND INTO THE 30s AS A WHOLE DIFFERENT STORY. AND THEN YOU HAVE ONE THIRD OF THE PARTY. THIS IS WHY NIKKI HALEY IS A BIGGER DEAL. >>. HOW BIG OF A WARNING SIGN IN A GENERAL ELECTION. THAT THE FACT, THAT SOME OF THESE STATES IT'S 30 OR 40% OF THE VOTERS >>. I THINK TRUMP SHOULD FEEL BETTER ABOUT HIS PERFORMANCE IN MICHIGAN AND SHE DIDN'T GET 40 BUT SHE GOT UNDER 30. THIS TIME TO ME. MICHIGAN AGAIN AND TALK ABOUT ESTATE DESIGNED FOR HER TO DO WELL IN WITH OPEN PRIMARIES ET CETERA. I THINK THE DEMOCRATS WHO DECIDED TO STAY VOTING IN THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY PROBABLY HURT HER AND SHE GOT THE SAME AMOUNT OF DEMOCRATIC CROSSOVER INTO THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY. SHE DID IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND I GUESS IF SHE IS IN THE LOW 40s OR HIGH 30s BUT THESE ARE REPUBLICANS WHO WILL NOW HE WILL BE THE NOMINEE. WHO KNOWS SHE CAN'T GET THE NOMINATION, WHO STILL SHOWS UP TO VOTE AND ONCE YOU VOTE AGAINST TRUMP. IT'S EASY TO KEEP VOTING AGAINST HIM. I THINK, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THESE TWO SITUATIONS, IT'S NOT A CLOSE CALL AND TRUMP HAS A MUCH BIGGER PROBLEM THAN BIDEN AND GOING INTO THIS. I WASN'T 100% SURE, BUT MY GUT WAS. IT WASN'T GOING TO BE WHAT SOME PEOPLE THOUGHT ABOUT, AND I THINK IT TURNED OUT TO BE WHAT I THOUGHT IT WAS. >> WHAT WILL HAPPEN WITH A THIRD-PARTY CANDIDATE. AND WE WILL READ A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IT, BASICALLY SAYING: THE WIND HAS COME OUT OF THE SALES. AND YOU SAY THE DEBATE OVER ABORTION, ACCESS IS SOMETHING, ALWAYS BEEN DEBATED. AND IF ABORTION IS THE ISSUE FOR A LARGE CHUNK OF VOTERS, THEN THEY AREN'T GOING TO BE INTERESTED IN THE THIRD- PARTY COMPROMISE, NO MATTER WHAT THAT POSITION IS. AND IF ABORTION IS A VOTING ISSUE FOR SOMEBODY, THEY WILL HAVE A DEFINITIVE POSITION ON WHICH PARTY THEY WANT MAKING REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH LAWS AND APPOINTING JUDGES. AND THE CASE FOR A THIRD-PARTY ALTERNATIVE IS OVER AND NOT A MARKET FOR IT. AND I WILL ADD ANOTHER NOTE: THAT YOU HAVE BIG NAMES LIKE JOE MANCHIN AND LARRY HOGAN WHO ARE OUT OF THIS BUT NOT REALLY CANDIDATES >>. I GO BACK TO. ONE OF THE THINGS IS WE WANT TO TURN THE TEMPERATURE DOWN AND FIND SOME MIDDLE GROUND RIGHT NOW AND ABORTION IT'S EITHER FOR ACCESSORY WANT TO RESTRICTED. WE ARE NOT IN A DEBATE ABOUT THIS BUT THIS IS THE CONVERSATION AND THIS IS A DIFFERENT CONVERSATION AND IVF HAS BROUGHT THAT IN. BUT RIGHT NOW, THAT'S WHERE IT IS. IF ABORTION WAS CONSIDERED SETTLED SORT OF THE WAY, SAME SEX MARRIAGES- AND I KNOW ADVOCATES THINK ABOUT THAT, BUT THE LIONS SHARE OF THE ELECTORATE IS SETTLED, THAT WOULDN'T BE A CONCERN. BUT CAN YOU IMAGINE TRYING TO COME UP WITH THE TICKET AND ONE IS FOR AND ONE IS AGAINST ACCESS FOR IT? THERE IS NO SCENARIO THAT THIS MAKES ANY SENSE IF ABORTION ISN'T AS URGENT OF AN ISSUE AS IT IS AND IT IS >>. AND IF IT ISN'T IN A POST >>. AND IF IT ISN'T IN A POST. ROE VERSUS A WARRIOR -- ROE V WADE WORLD >>. THE JERSEY COLOR MATTERS AND THEY ARE EDUCATED AND I THINK THEY KNOW THAT THEY GET THIS DISTRACTED FROM THIS ISSUE >>. IT WILL BE FASCINATING TO WATCH, THANK YOU AND READ HIS COLUMN- AND IT IS A GREAT ONE COMING UP NEXT: HUNTER BIDEN TESTIFYING ON THE HILL, A NEW REPORTING ON WHAT IS GOING ON BEHIND CLOSED DOORS AND HEATED MOMENTS BETWEEN REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS, AND LATER THE MEMBER TRYING TO STOP HIS PARTY FROM SPLITTING THE BILL FROM THE >>>. WELCOME BACK. >>>. WELCOME BACK NOW TO SOME OTHER MAJOR STORIES DEVELOPING ON CAPITOL HILL. RIGHT NOW HUNTER BIDEN IS APPEARING FOR A CLOSED-DOOR DEPOSITION. IN THE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY INTO JOE BIDEN, AND ACCORDING TO HIS OPENING STATEMENT, THE PRESIDENTS SON WAS DEFIANT, TELLING LAWMAKERS THAT FOR MORE THAN A YEAR YOUR COMMITTEES HAVE HUNTED ME IN THE POLITICAL PURSUIT OF MY DAD AND YOU DON'T HAVE EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE CONSPIRACIES ABOUT MY FATHER, BECAUSE THERE IS NOT ANY. AND THIS MORNING THE OVERSIGHT CHAIRMAN, JAMES KOLMAR, WAS DEFINED THAT THEIR INVESTIGATION WOULDN'T END AFTER THE DEPOSITION. >>. WITH EACH INTERVIEW WE DO LEARN MORE INFORMATION AND WE FIND MORE POTENTIAL EVIDENCE THAT NEEDS TO BE OBTAINED AND MORE TIPS AND ACCUSATIONS THAT NEED TO BE INVESTIGATED, NEED TO BE INVESTIGATED. SO AS LONG AS WE KEEP GETTING NEW INFORMATION, WE WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE THAT. >>. DEMOCRATS CALLING IT A WASTE OF TIME, SAYING: HUNTER BIDEN HAS CORROBORATED OTHER WITNESSES. WHO SAID THE PRESIDENT WASN'T INVOLVED IN HIS SON'S BUSINESS DEALINGS >>. WHAT WE SAW WAS A RATHER EMBARRASSING SPECTACLE WHERE THE REPUBLICANS CONTINUE TO BE LABOR COMPLETELY TRIVIAL POINTS BASED ON THIS FIRST HOUR THAT THIS WHOLE THING HAS BEEN A TREMENDOUS WASTE OF OUR LEGISLATIVE TIME AND THE PEOPLE'S RESOURCES >>. WHAT WE WITNESSED OVER THE LAST HOUR WAS A DEEP-SEA FISHING EXPEDITION BECAUSE THE REPUBLICAN CASE HAVE COMPLETE THE FALLEN APART OVER THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS >>. WE WILL HEAR MORE FROM ONE OF THE MEMBERS INSIDE THE ROOM FOR THAT DEPOSITION IN A MOMENT. BUT FIRST, OUR SENIOR INVESTIGATIVE PRODUCER. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND IT IS GREAT TO HAVE YOU AND IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE. HE HAS RESISTED TESTIFYING FOR MONTHS BUT TODAY WHAT IS CHANGED AND WHAT IS COME OUT OF THIS >>. WHAT HAS CHANGED IS BOTH SIDES AND THE STAKES ARE TOO HIGH AS CONTINUED TO BE PERCEIVED AS DRAGGING THIS OUT, AND REPUBLICANS ARE UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY TO DELIVER. AND THIS WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED HAD IT NOT FALLEN APART. AND HE IS FACING TWO COMPLETELY SEPARATE CHARGES IN TWO CASES RELATED, AND I DON'T THINK A FEDERAL JUDGE WOULD LOOK FAVORABLY TO FIND SUBPOENAS, SO IT WASN'T WORTH THE RISK. WHAT THE SOURCES SAY IS ULTIMATELY, WHEN BOTH SIDES STOPPED POSTURING AND CAME TO THE TABLE, IT WAS A STRAIGHTFORWARD NEGOTIATION AND THEY WILL RELEASE TRANSCRIPTS QUICKLY AND THE TESTIMONY WON'T GO LONGER THAN A DAY, SO IT IS PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD. ONCE THEY SIT DOWN AND TALK TO EACH OTHER. >> YOU HERE, REGARDLESS OF WHAT HAPPENED. TODAY WE HAVE MORE PEOPLE WHO INTERVIEW WITH THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM IN THE THINKING IS ONCE THEY INTERVIEWED HUNTER BIDEN. THIS WOULD BE WRAPPING UP BUT HE SEEMED TO SUGGEST OTHERWISE. DESPITE THE FACT, THERE WAS A WITNESS JUST ACCUSED AND CHARGED WITH LYING, AND GETTING INFORMATION FROM RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE IS A PART OF THIS INVESTIGATION >>. THIS GETS MORE FASCINATING. I THINK WE HAVE SEEN A CHANGE IN POSTURE AND UP TO THIS POINT REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN FOCUSED ON. THIS IS A CRESCENDO, WITH EVERYTHING LEADING UP TO IT. BUT NOW WE HAVE HEARD DIFFERENT THINGS THAT THE INVESTIGATION WILL CONTINUE, AND HE JUST SAID DOOR CAMERAS RECENTLY HE WILL HOLD A PUBLIC HEARING AND EXACTLY WHAT THAT WILL MEAN, WE DON'T KNOW. THAT IS SOMETHING BRAND-NEW. THAT IS SOMETHING BRAND-NEW. I THINK WE WILL SEE A CHANGE IN POSTURE. BUT THEY DO SAY THEY ARE ON TRACK TO RELEASE A REPORT ABOUT THE INVESTIGATION WHICH WOULD INCLUDE LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS OR EVEN CRIMINAL REFERRALS THAT THEY HAVE SUGGESTED IN THE SPRING, AND WE WILL SEE IF THEY STICK TO THAT >>. SO THE INFORMANT IS MOVING TO THE LEGAL PROCESS. AND WHAT ARE REPUBLICANS SAYING ABOUT THE EXTENT TO WHICH THESE REVELATIONS? THAT ONE OF THEIR KEY WITNESSES WAS BEING FED INFORMATION BY RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE. WHAT DID THEY SAY ABOUT HOW THAT IMPACTS THEIR OVERALL CASE? >>. I THINK REPUBLICANS ARE EXTREMELY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS AND THEY THINK THIS IS AN OVERSIGHT. AND THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS AND ASKING TOUGH QUESTIONS ABOUT IT AND WHAT. ONE SOURCE SAID TO ME LAST NIGHT. THIS WAS SAID TO ME LAST NIGHT. THIS WAS A BRICK IN THE FOUNDATION, BUT NOT THE FOUNDATION. THEY SAY THERE ARE OTHER DOCUMENTS AND OTHER WITNESSES BUT I DON'T THINK WE WILL HEAR VERY MUCH ABOUT THOSE IN PARTICULAR. BUT WHAT I DO THINK WE WILL HERE IS A NEW FOCUS FOR THESE COMMITTEES ON THE HUMAN SOURCE PROGRAM. AND HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT A HUMAN SOURCE? IF YOU READ THE INDICTMENT FROM SPECIAL COUNSEL FOR LYING TO THE FBI CONTINUOUSLY OVER A TEN- YEAR PERIOD, HOW IS THAT PERSON ABLE TO BE THERE? I THINK YOU WILL SEE SOME TOUGH QUESTIONS ASKED ABOUT THE PROGRAM AND ABOUT THESE TYPES OF WITNESSES GOING FORWARD >>. IT CERTAINLY IS A DRAMATIC TWIST TO AN ALREADY INCREDIBLY DRAMATIC SITUATION, AND WHILE WE DRAMATIC SITUATION AND WHILE WE HAVE THIS CONVERSATION. JAMIE RASKIN SAID THE TESTIMONY IS OVER. SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT. IT IS GREAT TO SEE A. I WILL NOW BRING IN THE DEMOCRAT FROM VIRGINIA WHO, AS WE JUST MENTIONED, WAS INSIDE THAT ROOM DURING THE DEPOSITION. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US AND WE DO REALLY APPRECIATE IT. DO REALLY APPRECIATE IT. >> MY PLEASURE >>. WHAT WERE THE KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM YOU? DID REPUBLICANS GET ANY CLOSER TO PROVING THEIR CASE OR MAKING A CASE THAT THERE WAS A LINK BETWEEN HUNTER BIDEN AND HIS FATHER >>. NONE AT ALL. I THINK THAT IS THEIR FRUSTRATION. I WAS LISTENING TO YOUR INVESTIGATIVE REPORTING AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE IS TALKING ABOUT. YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT HUNTER BIDEN OFFERED TO THE COMMITTEE TO TESTIFY IN PUBLIC AND THEY DIDN'T WANT THAT AND THEY WERE AFRAID OF IT. THAT IS WHY WE HAD TODAY'S DEPOSITION. IT'S NOT THAT HE WAS AFRAID OF A CITATION, BUT REPUBLICANS WERE AFRAID OF ALLOWING HIM TO TESTIFY IN OPEN SESSION FOR FEAR THAT HE WOULD BE AS EFFECTIVE IN A PUBLIC GUY AS HE WAS BEHIND CLOSED DOORS. SECONDLY, THEY INDICATED THAT THERE WOULD BE A SHIFT AND FOCUS ON THE VALUE OF THE FBI'S FOCUS ON THE VALUE OF THE FBI'S HUMAN INTEL PROGRAM. I DON'T THINK SO. I THINK WE WILL FOCUS ON THE FACT THAT THE REPUBLICANS RELY FUNDAMENTALLY ON THE TESTIMONY OF THREE KEY WITNESSES, ONE OF WHOM IS IN JAIL FOR 14 YEARS FOR FELONIES AND ONE OF WHOM IS NOW IN JAIL FOR RISK OF FLEEING AND LYING TO THE FBI AND BEING A RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE AGENT. THE THIRD IS ACCUSED OF BEING A SPY FOR THE CHINESE COMMUNIST GOVERNMENT. THAT IS THEIR CASE. >>. LET ME SAY WE STAND BY SERAS REPORTING AND ALL OF OUR REPORTING HERE ON NBC, AND WHY WOULDN'T THERE BE AN INVESTIGATION AS TO HOW THIS COULD HAVE? --. I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU SAY, BUT SHOULD THERE BE A FOLLOW-UP INVESTIGATION INTO HOW THIS COULD'VE HAPPENED? >>. I THINK THERE OUGHT TO BE AN INVESTIGATION OF HOW THE REPUBLICANS ON THE COMMITTEE DECLARED THIS A GAME, CHANGING TESTIMONY, WITHOUT ANY DUE DILIGENCE OR LOOKING AT THE CREDIBILITY. AND, BY THE WAY, THERE WERE A LOT OF WARNING SIGNS, INCLUDING FROM THE REPUBLICAN SENATE, WHICH WARNED THEM THAT THIS WASN'T CREDIBLE TESTIMONY. >>. ARE YOU GETTING A SENSE AND TAKE ME INSIDE YOUR CONVERSATIONS WITH YOUR REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES. ARE THEY PLANNING TO MOVE FORWARD PUBLICLY? YOU HEARD JAMES COMBER SAID: YES, HE IS MOVING FORWARD WITH THE INVESTIGATION AND CALL MORE WITNESSES, AND HE KNOWS WHO THEY ARE PRIVATELY. ARE ANY OF YOUR REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES SAYING ANYTHING DIFFERENTLY TO YOU? IS THERE A SENSE? THIS CAN'T GO FORWARD. >>. YES, THERE ARE REPUBLICANS WHO WANT TO GIVE UP THIS QUEST AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE, BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE IN FURTHER ERODING. THEY BELIEVE IN FURTHER ERODING THIS AND FRANKLY. EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT AND IT WILL MAKE THEM AT SOME POINT, LOOK SILLY AND SHRILL AND THEY WANT TO PURSUE THIS. SO YOU DO HAVE THAT DICHOTOMY IN THE REPUBLICAN CAUCUS, BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY FROM A POLITICAL POINT OF VIEW. GO AHEAD AND HAVE THIS, AND WE WELCOME IT AND WE BELIEVE THERE IS A STRONG CASE THAT CAN BE MADE, THAT THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE OR CONNECTION BETWEEN THE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OF HUNTER BIDEN AND HIS FATHER. >>. LET ME ASK YOU, BECAUSE YOUR DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUE, SAID HUNTERS FORMER BUSINESS ASSOCIATE, SAID HUNTER BIDEN WAS SELLING THE ILLUSION OF ACCESS TO HIS FATHER AND DO ANY OF THE ACTIONS I, THE PRESIDENT OR HIS FAMILY DESERVES SOME OVERSIGHT GIVEN THAT. >>. IF YOU ARE THE SON DAUGHTER SIBLING OF A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, IT IS UNAVOIDABLE THAT YOUR NAME HAS A CERTAIN CACHET TO IT, WHETHER YOU SELL IT OR NOT. AND WAS HUNTER BIDEN COGNIZANT OF THAT AND DID HE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT? I PRESUME HE DID, LIKE OTHER. I PRESUME HE DID LIKE OTHER CHILDREN OF FIRST FAMILIES, LIKE JARED KUSHNER. SO THAT IS THE CRIME AND IT DOESN'T IN ANY WAY IMPLICATE THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF AND HUNTER BIDEN. --. >>. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE PRESIDENT AND, AS WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT AT THE TOP OF THE SHOW, THERE HAS BEEN SOME WARNING SIGNS FROM HIM IN MICHIGAN, WITH 13% OF VOTERS VOTING UNCOMMITTED IN THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY, AND IT'S NOT AS HIGH OF A NUMBER AS IT COULD'VE BEEN BUT IT ISN'T ZERO- ZERO. WHAT YOU MAKE OF THAT? HAVE THERE BEEN DOUBLE DIGITS BEFORE AND EVEN PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD THAT. BUT WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF WHAT WE SAW IN MICHIGAN LAST NIGHT? >>. I AGREE WITH CHUCK TODD ON YOUR EARLIER STATEMENT. I BELIEVE WAY TOO MUCH IS BEING READ INTO THIS. HE GOT 81% OF THE VOTE AND CAN'T REMEMBER. TRUMP GOT 68% AND, IN FACT, NIKKI HALEY- THAT IS TWICE THE PERCENTAGE AND TWICE THE VOTE OF THE UNCOMMITTED AGAINST BIDEN. SO IF YOU FOLLOW THE LOGIC THAT BIDEN IS IN TROUBLE BECAUSE OF AN UNCOMMITTED VOTE OF 13.1% AND TRUMP MUST BE IN DIRE TROUBLE WHEN NIKKI HALEY DOUBLES THAT. I THINK THERE IS A DANGER READING INTO IT. I DO AGREE THAT IT IS HIGHER THAN ONE WOULD LIKE AND THE WARNING SIGN FROM MICHIGAN AND THE PRESIDENT WILL HAVE TO ADDRESS THAT. BUT I HARDLY THINK IT IS THE END OF THE WORLD AND IT SHOULDN'T DIMINISH FROM THE FACT THAT HE DOMINATED THE FIELD IN MICHIGAN AND THE ONE PLACE WHERE PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO EXPRESS THEIR OPPOSITION DECIDED TO MAKE THEIR STAND. >>. LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT A REALLY STUNNING NEWS ON CAPITOL HILL AND LEADER McCONNELL ANNOUNCING HE WILL STEP BACK FROM HIS LEADERSHIP POSITION IN NOVEMBER. WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION TO THAT AND, AS WE REPORTED, A WHOLE RANGE OF FACTORS WENT INTO THAT, LIKE ME, FROM HIS AGE TO, OF COURSE, IS DISAGREEMENT AND CLASHES WITH FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP. >>. YOU CAN BE ON TOP OF THE WORLD ONE DAY AND THEN AT THE BOTTOM OF THE VALLEY THE NEXT DAY. AND I THINK MITCH McCONNELL HAS HAD A CONFLUENCE OF EVENTS HAPPEN IN HIS LIFE, POLITICAL AND PERSONAL, AND THOSE ARE HEALTH ISSUES IN TERMS OF HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH TRUMP AND IN TERMS OF GROWING WITHIN HIS OWN CAUCUS AND IN THE SENATE. ALL OF THOSE CAME TOGETHER, I THINK, TO PERSUADE HIM THAT AT THIS AGE HE HAS DONE THIS AND HE HAS NOW BEEN IN THE HISTORY BOOK AS BEING THE LONGEST RUNNING LEADER AND IT'S TIME TO HAND THE TORCH TO SOMEBODY ELSE. AND I THINK IT'S A GOOD DECISION, AND I AM NOT ENTIRELY SURPRISED, GIVEN THE EVENTS LAST YEAR. >>. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PERSPECTIVE TODAY AND WE DO APPRECIATE THAT. APPRECIATE THAT. >>> A REALITY CHECK FOR A POTENTIAL HOSTAGE: RELEASE THE DEAL AS FAMILIES FIGHT FOR THE RELEASE OF LOVED ONES. TOP STORY WITH TOM LLAMAS, WEEKNIGHTS AT 7:00 ON NBC NEWS NOW. >>>. WELCOME BACK DAYS AFTER PRESIDENT BIDEN TOLD REPORTERS. HE WAS CONFIDENT IN A TEMPORARY CEASE-FIRE THAT WOULD BE REACHED BETWEEN THEM. THEY ARE DOWNPLAYING THE PROSPECTS OF A BREAKTHROUGH FOR AN AGREEMENT BUT OFFICIALS FROM QATAR, MEDIATING THE NEGOTIATIONS, SAID THEY ARE PUSHING HARD FOR DEAL BY THE START OF THE HOLY MONTH OF RAMADAN- START ON MARCH 10. AND TODAY A SPOKESMAN ECHOED THE OPTIMISM THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN EXPRESSED ON MONDAY: >> WE AGREE THAT IT COULD BE POSSIBLE AND WE HAVE A CONTINUATION TO WORK IN PROGRESS, PROGRESS >>. WE DO HAVE THE LATEST >>. Reporter. AS THE FIGHTING RAGES ON IN GAZA AND THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN THE STRIP DEEPENS, THERE IS VERY LITTLE EVIDENCE ON THE GROUND THAT SUPPORTS PRESIDENT BIDEN'S EARLIER UP TO MISS HIM, THAT A CEASE-FIRE DEAL AS POSSIBLE BY MONDAY. AND I SPOKE TO AN ISRAELI OFFICIAL EARLIER TODAY. THEY SAY THE TALKS AT THIS POINT, AT THIS POINT, ARE BASICALLY STALLED AND THAT ISRAEL AND THE UNITED STATES ARE WAITING FOR A FORMAL RESPONSE FROM HAMAS. FOR THAT FRAMEWORK HAMMERED OUT WITH THE CIA DIRECTOR IN PARIS OVER THE WEEKEND AND WE DID SPEAK EARLIER TO A SENIOR HAMAS OFFICIAL. HE CONFIRMS THAT HAMAS IS STILL STUDYING THAT PROPOSAL. BUT SAID THERE ARE VERY SIGNIFICANT OBSTACLES STANDING IN THE WAY OF A DEAL AT THIS POINT AND OF A DEAL AT THIS POINT, AND POINTS TO A FEW. OF THEM, ONE IS THE PERENNIAL QUESTION OF WHETHER A CEASE FIRE WOULD BE TEMPORARY, WHICH IS WHAT ISRAEL SAYS NEEDS TO HAPPEN, AND IT WOULD DOOM. IT'S A MILITARY CAMPAIGN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF ANY DEAL, BUT WHETHER THE CEASE FIRE WOULD BE PERMANENT, WHICH IS WHAT HAMAS WANTS, AND THEY SAY, ANY PAUSE IN FIGHTING HAVE TO LEAD TO A PERMANENCE IN THE WAR, AND THERE IS A QUESTION OF WHETHER THE ISRAELI FORCES WILL WITHDRAW FROM POPULATION CENTERS INSIDE OF GAZA DURING THE DEAL, OR WHETHER THEY WILL LEAVE THE STRIP ALTOGETHER, WHICH IS WHAT HAMAS IS DEMANDING. AND EVERY DAY THAT GOES BY WITHOUT, A DEAL IS GROWING, FOR THE 134 HOSTAGES STILL BEING HELD BY HAMAS, AND THERE IS A SPECIAL URGENCY ABOUT GETTING THOSE FEMALE HOSTAGES OUT, FOLLOWING TESTIMONY THAT SOME OF THEM MAY BE FACING SEXUAL ABUSE AT THE HANDS OF THEIR CAPTORS. AND THERE IS URGENCY ABOUT THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS AND THE UN SAID ONE QUARTER OF ALL THE PEOPLE IN GAZA ARE A STEP AWAY FROM FAMINE AT THIS POINT, THAT BORDERLINE STARVATION, PARTICULARLY CONCENTRATED IN THE NORTH OF GAZA, WHERE THE UN SAID ISRAELI MILITARY RESTRICTIONS ARE, AND A COMPLETE LAPSE OF LAW AND ORDER MEANS. THEY CAN NO LONGER DELIVER FOOD TO THE NORTH OF THE STRIP, AND OUR TEAMS HAVE SEEN FAMILIES THAT ARE TRYING TO FEED THEIR CHILDREN WITH FLAKES OF BARLEY INTENDED FOR DONKEYS AND THEY INTENDED FOR DONKEYS. AND THEY SAY THEY ARE SENDING THEIR KIDS OUT DODGING GUNBATTLES TO FIND FIREWOOD BECAUSE THERE IS NO COOKING GAS. AND EVERY DAY THE FIGHTING CONTINUES IS ANOTHER DAY THAT THIS DEEPENS. >> A DIRE SITUATION IN THANK YOU. >> MORE ON THE RACE AND A GENERATIONAL SHIFT IN WASHINGTON. AS SENATOR MITCH McCONNELL ANNOUNCES, HE IS STEPPING DOWN AS A REPUBLICAN YOUNG PEOPLE â™ª. >>>. I BELIEVE MORE STRONGLY THAN EVER, THEN GLOBAL LEADERSHIP IS ESSENTIAL FOR AMERICA TO PRESERVE THE SHINING CITY ON THE HILL THAT RONALD REAGAN HAD. AND AS LONG AS I DRAW ON THIS EARTH, I WILL DEFEND AMERICA EXCEPTIONALLY. DEFEND AMERICA EXCEPTIONALLY. >>>. WELCOME BACK. THAT WAS MITCH McCONNELL ON THE SENATE FLOOR TODAY, ANNOUNCING HE WOULD BE STEPPING DOWN AS THE REPUBLICAN LEADER AND JOINING ME NOW TO DISCUSS ALL OF THE HEADLINES. WHO IS THE WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT AND HOST OF THE PODCAST AND THE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR FOR THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE FORMER ILLINOIS REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN. AND THANK YOU TO ALL OF US FOR BEING HERE. AND LET'S START WITH YOU AND THIS STUNNING ANNOUNCEMENT- NOT EXACTLY A SURPRISE, BUT IT IS HUGELY SIGNIFICANT. AND THIS IS THE CHANGING OF THE GUARD. AND WE TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT NOW IS THE TIME FOR NEW GENERATION OF POLITICAL LEADERS, AND THAT IS SOMETHING. THAT IS LANGUAGE THAT WILL RESONATE. >>. CLEARLY, THERE HAD BEEN CONCERNS ABOUT HIS HEALTH, DATING BACK AND SOME OF THESE HE HAD. SO THAT WAS A VERY REAL THING AND A QUESTION HANGING OVER HIM AND HOW MUCH LONGER HE WOULD CONTINUE AS LEADER. HE DID MENTION THAT MAYBE THE PARTY HAD MOVED ON FROM WHERE HE WAS AND HE BELIEVES STRONGLY FOR INSTANCE THAT HE ACKNOWLEDGED. THE PARTY IS IN A DIFFERENT PLACE AND POTENTIALLY ISN'T LEADING THE PARTY BUT LEADING SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND THAT'S AN UNDERCURRENT AND, AS YOU SAW OVER THE WEEKEND, SAY A STRAW POLL AND HE WAS OVERWHELMINGLY LIKE THE PARTY HAS MOVED TO A DIFFERENT POINT. >>. HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK THIS WILL PLAY IN HIS DECISION? AND WHAT DOES THE SENATE LOOK LIKE WITH A POST McCONNELL LEADERSHIP >>. I BELIEVE THAT HISTORY WILL JUDGE HIM LATER AND HE WILL GO DOWN AS THE BEST LEGISLATIVE STRATEGIST THAT IS EVER SERVED IN THE US SENATE. AND LOOK AT THE REPUBLICAN ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT HE WAS ABLE TO HELP SHEPHERD THROUGH DURING HIS TIME IN THE SENATE, AND I DON'T THINK IT WILL LOOK MUCH DIFFERENT. IF YOU LOOK AT THE NEXT STABLE POSSIBLE LEADERS, YOU HAVE SENATOR CORNYN AND SENATOR BARRASSO AND I THINK THEY WILL TAKE THAT AND DO WHAT HE DID WELL AND HOPEFULLY INTERTWINE THAT INTO A MAGA ENVIRONMENT. >>. WHAT IS YOUR TAKE OF? PRESIDENT BIDEN IS REELECTED AND HE IS DEPRIVED OF ONE OF HIS REPUBLICAN ALLIES ON THE HILL. >>. YOU CALL HIM AN ALLY. >>. HE IS IN TERMS OF -- >>. IT WAS REASSURING OF HAVING HIM THERE AND WITH THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE MERRICK GARLAND NOMINATION AND HISTORICALLY BUT YOU'D DID KNOW THAT WHEN THERE WAS A DEBT LIMIT, THAT YOU COULD KEEP THE GOVERNMENT OPEN, THAT MITCH McCONNELL WAS GOING TO BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DELIVER VOTES AND THE OTHER SENATORS. IT NOTED QUITE NOT AS EXPERIENCED BUT -- IT DOES MAKE ME SAD. HE DID IT RIGHT AFTER THE MEETING IN THE OVAL OFFICE AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE A SENSE OF WHY IT WAS TODAY WITH HIS TIMING, BECAUSE IT SUGGESTS HE WAS GIVING UP ON UKRAINE FUNDING AND I HATE TO SAY THAT BUT THAT COULD BE WHERE WE ARE. >>. IF I KNOW MITCH McCONNELL AND HIS TEAM, HE HAS HAD THIS DATE PLANNED FOR A WHILE. >>. WHAT IS INTERESTING, HE HAS THIS LEGACY, WHICH HE WILL BE REMEMBERED FOR: FOR NOT BRINGING MERRICK GARLAND TO A VOTE, WHICH QUITE FRANKLY SHIFTED THE DIRECTION OF THE COURT, AND ALSO FOR VOTING NOT TO CONVICT FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP DURING HIS IMPEACHMENT AND THOSE ARE TWO OF THE BIG THINGS ON HIS RESUME AT THIS POINT. >> THOSE ARE TWO THINGS THAT STAND OUT AND THIS STRATEGIC DECISION NOT TO ALLOW THAT MERRICK GARLAND VOTE TO HAPPEN, REALLY DID CHANGE THE COURSE OF THE COURT AND ULTIMATELY, HE ALLOWED FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP TO THEN END UP WITH THREE JUSTICES CONFIRMED TO THE SUPREME COURT AND HE IS IN MANY WAYS AN INSTITUTIONAL LIST BUT ALSO ABLE TO FIND A WAY TO BEND THE INSTITUTIONAL RULES IN A WAY THAT WORKED FOR HIM. >> BECAUSE CHUCK SCHUMER ALLOWED THE NUCLEAR OPTION, INVENTED THE INSTITUTIONAL RULES. >> WE WON'T GO DOWN THAT RABBIT HOLE. >> WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL BE HIS LEGACY ULTIMATELY? >> VERY EFFECTIVE. AS A LEGISLATOR, I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN I DON'T MEAN TO HARP ON I MEAN I DON'T MEAN TO HARP ON THE GUY BUT THE MERRICK GARLAND NOMINATION WAS A BIG MOMENT, >> THE BIGGEST MOMENT, AS WE NOW IS REPUBLICANS HAVE THREE IS REPUBLICANS HAVE THREE JUSTICES ON THE SUPREME COURT AND A DEMOCRATIC LEADER WOULDN'T HAVE DONE THE EXACT SAME THING. >> NOW THEY DON'T. >> WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WOULD'VE HAPPENED. >> WE KNOW WHAT WOULD'VE HAPPENED. >> LET'S TALK ABOUT MICHIGAN AND THE LESSONS OF MICHIGAN, AND TALKING ABOUT THIS WITH CHUCK TODD. YOU CAN'T OVERSTATE WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE 13% UNCOMMITTED VOTES AND IT COULD'VE BEEN A LOT WORSE, GIVEN HOW ORGANIZED IT WAS. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, THE WHITE HOUSE IS WATCHING CLOSELY AND THAT IS 100,000 PEOPLE. WHO SAID THAT IN A STATE THAT IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO PRESIDENT BIDEN'S REELECTION, SAYING WE ARE UNCOMMITTED, AND AT THE SAME TIME, AS THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN WILL READILY POINT OUT, 13% UNCOMMITTED ISN'T MUCH WORSE THAN 11% UNCOMMITTED FOR FORMER PRESIDENT OBAMA WHEN HE FACED A LARGELY UNCONTESTED PRIMARY AND THEY POINTED OUT THAT TURNOUT FOR AN UNCONTESTED PRIMARY THAT IT WAS QUITE HIGH AND THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE: >> WHAT YOU MAKE OF IT AND WHAT ARE THEY SAYING ABOUT THIS TURNOUT? >> IT COULD'VE BEEN WORSE >>. THE DEMOCRATS IN THE STATE ARE VERY EFFECTIVE AND THEY HAD VERY TOUGH ELECTIONS AND THEY GET THEM BY BIG MARGINS AND THEY HAVE GREAT TURNOUT OPERATION AND IT'S EASIER TO VOTE IN MICHIGAN- THAT IT IS EVER BEFORE AND SHE WORKED REALLY HARD AND IT WAS KIND OF UNDER THE RADAR. BUT THEY DO FEEL GOOD ABOUT WHERE THEY ARE AND PEOPLE IN MICHIGAN ARE CERTAINLY CONCERNED. BUT THEY DO FEEL LIKE THEY CONTAINED IT AND IT SHOWS IN NOVEMBER THAT THEY CAN GET PEOPLE TO TURN OUT AGAIN AND IT'S NOT LIKE THE WHITE HOUSE. THEY DIDN'T KNOW, THEY HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE VOTERS AND IT'S NOT A NEWS FLASH AND HOPE. BY THE TIME THEY GET TO NOVEMBER, FOR A LOT OF REASONS THEY ARE IN A DIFFERENT PLACE >>. I THINK NIKKI HALEY WAS HOPING UNDOUBTEDLY SHE WOULD HAVE HAD A STRONGER PERFORMANCE IN MICHIGAN, BECAUSE THIS WAS AN OPEN PRIMARY AND PART OF HER ARGUMENT THAT SHE WOULD DO WELL IN NEW HAMPSHIRE IN MICHIGAN. AND SHE SAYS THE FACT THAT THERE ARE STATES WITH SEMIOPEN STATES FOR SUPER TUESDAY BUT DO YOU THINK SHE WILL GO BEYOND SUPER TUESDAY? >> NO, I DO NOT. >>. YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE RESOURCES. I THINK SHE AND HER TEAM WILL HAVE TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND THEY WILL HAVE TO ASSESS WHETHER OR NOT. THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES TO CONTINUE INTO SUPER TUESDAY, BECAUSE YOU CAN TALK ABOUT BEING COMPETITIVE WITH ALL THE STATES AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO ACTUALLY BE COMPETITIVE, THEN WHY DO YOU STAY IN'S? >>. IT WAS A TOUGH FIGHT BEFORE AND WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE? >>. YOU SAY WE WILL GO ALL THE WAY BUT THEN SHE MADE HER FIRST TRIP TO MICHIGAN ON SUNDAY. THE PROBLEM IS WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE A LOT OF MONEY, AND SHE JUST MADE THE FIRST TRIP TO COLORADO AND I DO THINK SHE MEANT IT A WEEK OR SO AGAIN -- AGO THAT SHE WOULD STAY IN UNTIL THE CONVENTION BECAUSE YOU HANG AROUND AND YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN, AND FOR 40% OF THE VOTE IT SEEMED WORTHWHILE >>. WE WILL WATCH AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS. AND HERE, FORMER CONGRESSMAN RODNEY DAVIS, WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT AND AS WE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING DONALD TRUMP AND THEN WITH THE NEWS THAT MITCH McCONNELL, A CRITIC OF THE FORMER PRESIDENT, WILL STEP DOWN EARLIER THIS WEEK, WITH THE ANNOUNCEMENT MONDAY THAT THE RNC CHAIR IS STEPPING DOWN, PAVING THE WAY AS TRUMP'S DAUGHTER-IN-LAW TO SERVE AS COCHAIR BUT, DESPITE HIS GROWING INFLUENCE, ONE RNC MEMBER IS PUSHING A PAIR OF RESOLUTIONS ATTEMPTING TO KEEP TRUMP'S INFLUENCE SOMEWHAT CONSTRAINED IN. ONE OF THOSE WOULD BAR THE RNC FROM ASSUMING HIM AS THE PRESUMPTIVE NOMINEE, UNTIL HE SECURES ENOUGH DELEGATES AND THE OTHER WOULD PROHIBIT THE. THE OTHER WOULD PROHIBIT THE RNC FROM PAYING HIS LEGAL BILLS. HENRY BARBER IS THE MEMBER WHO SPONSORED THAT RESOLUTION AND HE JOINS ME NOW AND THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME AND I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. >>. IT IS GOOD TO BE WITH YOU AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. >>. TAKE ME BEHIND YOUR THINKING. WHAT PROMPTED YOU TO DRAFT THESE RESOLUTIONS? DO YOU THINK THEY WILL COME UP FOR CONSIDERATION, FOR A VOTE? >>. WHAT PROMPTED ME WAS TO DEFEND THE INSTITUTION OF THE RNC AND THE ROLES. THE CORNERSTONE OF THE RNC AND A PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY WILL BE NEUTRAL, SO THAT REALLY BECOMES AN OBSOLETE RESOLUTION, WHERE THE NEW TEAM RECOMMENDED BY TRUMP BEING INSTALLED NEXT WEEK AND A QUESTION THAT THEY WILL GET ELECTED, MAYBE NEXT WEEK BUT WE ARE CONTINUING TO PUSH THE RESOLUTION THAT WOULD PREVENT THE RNC FROM PAYING ANY CANDIDATES LEGAL BILLS, AND LEGALLY, THE RNC HAS A JOB TO WIN ELECTION, SO THEY SHOULD SPEND ITS RESOURCES ON THE POLITICAL OPERATIONS AND NOT PAYING CANDIDATES LEGAL BILLS >>. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT. DO YOU EXPECT EITHER RESOLUTION TO COME UP FOR A VOTE? >>. WE HAVE TO GET TWO OF THE THREE RNC MEMBERS TO DO THAT, AND RIGHT NOW WE HAVE EIGHT STATES COVERED AND WE DO BELIEVE WE HAVE UNTIL THREE DAYS BEFORE THE MEETING WHICH WOULD BE NEXT TUESDAY TO GET THOSE SOLIDIFIED. I HAVE TO GET A FEW MORE STATES. I WOULD SAY THERE ARE NOT PEOPLE JUST RUNNING TO ME TO DO THIS EVEN THOUGH. I WILL SAY THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO AGREE, INCLUDING THE PERSON RUNNING PRESIDENT TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN, AND HE SAID WE WOULDN'T USE RNC FUNDING FOR PAYING LEGAL BILLS. AND I WOULD ASK CHRIS THEN JOIN US AND MEMORIALIZE WHAT YOU HAVE SAID. MEMORIALIZE WHAT YOU HAVE SAID: PUBLIC FULLY SUPPORTING THIS RESOLUTION AND GIVING DONORS CONFIDENCE THAT THEIR MONEY WILL GET SPENT ON POLITICAL OPERATIONS AND NOT LEGAL BILLS. >>. DO YOU TAKE HIM AT HIS WORD? >> SURE, I DON'T SEE ANY REASON NOT TO. BUT IT WOULD BE FIRMER IN THE MINDS OF DONORS IF CHRIS THEN AND PRESIDENT TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN JOINED US WITH A RESOLUTION AND IT MAKES IT MORE FORMAL. >>. HAVE YOU GOTTEN BACK LASH FROM FELLOW MEMBERS OF THE RNC ARE FROM REPUBLICANS MORE BROADLY SPEAKING? >>. 100% OF THE PEOPLE I HAVE HEARD FROM HAS BEEN POSITIVE WHETHER BY TEXT OR EMAIL OR PHONE- PHONE. THAT IS NOT TO SAY EVERYBODY LOVES WHAT WE ARE DOING AND IT IS OKAY. IT IS OKAY TO DISAGREE. WE ARE TRYING TO DO THIS IN A WAY THAT ISN'T DISAGREEABLE BUT REALLY DEFENDING THE INSTITUTION AND THE RULES OF THE RNC >>. I WANT TO GET THE REACTION TO THIS, TO THE RESULTS IN MICHIGAN OVERNIGHT, BECAUSE WE WERE DISCUSSING THAT NIKKI HALEY DIDN'T GET, I THINK, THE BAR SHE WAS LOOKING FOR AND SHE SAID SHE IS IN THIS UNTIL SUPER TUESDAY AND THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF CALLS FOR HER TO DROP OUT SO THE REPUBLICANS CAN CONSOLIDATE AROUND TRUMP >>. SHE CAN STAY IN AS LONG AS SHE WANTS TO. AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED, THE REALITY IS THE RACE IS SHIFTING FROM THE PRIMARY TO THE GENERAL, AND THAT IS JUST A FACT. PRESIDENT TRUMP STAYS ON, PROBABLY BY MARCH 19. HE WILL HAVE THE DELEGATES REQUIRED TO EFFECTIVELY MAKE HIM THE PRESUMPTIVE NOMINEE AND JUST THINKING ABOUT THE BIGGER PICTURE IN THE GENERAL ELECTION. THERE IS A SURVEY THAT CAME OUT IN THE LAST FEW DAYS WITH 82% OF AMERICANS SAYING WE NEED A NEW PRESIDENT. >>. I HAVE TO STOP IT THERE.",[52]

WE BEGIN THIS MORNING WITH THE RACE FOR THE WHITE HOUSE. >>. ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE, FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IS LOOKING TO DEFEAT HIS RIVAL, NIKKI HALEY. FOR A FIFTH STRAIGHT TIME, NIKKI HALEY SPENT THE DAY MEETING VOTERS ACROSS MICHIGAN >>>. IN THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY, PRESIDENT BIDEN IS EXPECTED TO COME OUT ON TOP TODAY, BUT THERE HAS BEEN A PUSH BY SOME DEMOCRATS TO VOTE AGAINST THE PRESIDENT AND INSTEAD VOTING UNCOMMITTED ON THE BALLOT >>. IN MICHIGAN, YOU CAN ALWAYS COUNT ON CLOSE ELECTIONS. THAT IS TRUE, NO MATTER WHO IS ON THE BALLOT, AND THAT IS WHY IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THEY ARE FOCUSED ON MICHIGAN. I AM GRATEFUL THAT THE AGENDA HAS SHOWN PROBLEM-SOLVING AND VALUES THAT WE CARE ABOUT >>. WHAT CAN WE EXPECT TODAY? LET'S BRING IN JONATHAN ALLEN. LET'S START ON THE GOP SIDE FORMER. PRESIDENT TRUMP IS FAVORED TO WIN IN MICHIGAN, AND THAT WOULD PUT HIM ONE STEP CLOSER TO WINNING THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION FOR A REPUBLICAN NOMINATION FOR A THIRD STRAIGHT TIME. IF HALEY LOSES, REALISTICALLY, HOW LONG CAN SHE STAY IN THIS? UNTIL SUPER TUESDAY >>. SHE SEEMS TO ME TO BE COMMITTED TO STAYING THROUGH SUPER TUESDAY BEYOND. THAT WOULD BE A SHOCK. IF SHE WON MICHIGAN AT THIS POINT, THERE IS NOT A PATH FOR HER TO WIN THE NOMINATION THAT DOESN'T INVOLVE DONALD TRUMP. NO LONGER BEING ON THE BALLOT AND NIKKI HALEY CONTINUES TO GO FORWARD AGAIN. SHE HAS SO FAR BEEN ABLE TO IDENTIFY THAT SHE CAN ACTUALLY WIN. IT LOOKS LIKE DONALD TRUMP IS LIKELY TO WRAP UP THE NOMINATION IN TERMS OF DELEGATES BY SUPER TUESDAY, IF NOT BY WHAT IS CALLED MIDEAST SUPER TUESDAY. FOLLOWING THAT BACK ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE, I MENTIONED A PUSH BY SOME IN THE PARTY TO NOT VOTE FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN. THIS IS OVER HIS HANDLING OF THE ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR. THE GOVERNOR EXPECTS SOME WILL VOTE AGAINST THE PRESIDENT. LET'S LISTEN TO A LITTLE BIT OF THAT. >>. I THINK THERE WILL BE A SIZABLE NUMBER OF THOSE COMMITTED. I THINK IT IS EVERY PERSON'S RIGHT TO MAKE THEIR STATEMENT ABOUT WHAT IS IMPORTANT TO THE. AT THE END OF THE DAY, I AM ADVOCATING THAT PEOPLE CAST AN AFFIRMATIVE VOTE FOR JOE BIDEN, BECAUSE ANYTHING OTHER THAN THAT MAKES IT LIKELY. WE WOULD SEE A SECOND TRUMP TERM, AND THAT IS THAT FOR ALL COMMUNITIES. >> DETERMINING THE WINNER IN THE 2020 ELECTION. WHAT ARE YOU UP TO TODAY, AS VOTERS ARE CASTING THEIR BALLOTS? >>. I THINKRON NUMBER OF THE UNCOMMITTED VOTE AGAINST BIDEN WILL BE SOMETHING TO WATCH, BECAUSE IT WILL BASICALLY GIVE US SOME IDEA OF WHAT IS AT STAKE BUT HE HAS AT STAKE IN TERMS OF LOSING IN THE GENERAL ELECTION. WE HAVE SEEN MICHIGAN IN THE LAST TWO ELECTIONS COME IN REALLY CLOSELY A DIFFERENCE OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF VOTES COULD MAKE THE DIFFERENCE IN MICHIGAN, AND MICHIGAN COULD END UP MAKING THE DIFFERENCE ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT JOE BIDEN IS IGNORING, NOR IS IT SOMETHING HE CAN AFFORD TO IGNORE, NOR IS IT SOMETHING THAT IS SMALL POTATOES. I DO THINK WATCHING THAT UNCOMMITTED NUMBER WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR CERTAINLY THE WHITE HOUSE, THE MEDIA TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF WHAT WILL HAPPEN LATER THIS YEAR, AND I AM SURE FOLKS IN THE TRUMP CAMP WILL BE WATCHING IT AS WELL. >>. JOHN, A REMINDER THAT PRIMARY SEASON IS A LITTLE CONFUSING AT TIMES. THE MAJORITY RACE WILL BE AWARDED THIS WEEKEND AT A STATE PARTY CONVENTION. WHAT MORE SHOULD WE KNOW ABOUT THAT? >>. IT IS A CIRCUS IN MICHIGAN. FIRST OF ALL, THEY HAVE THIS HYBRID PRIMARY. A LOT OF IT IS HYBRID PRIMARY. A LOT OF IT IS BASED ON THE CONVENTION. THE PROBLEM IN MICHIGAN: THEY HAVE TWO DIFFERENT PEOPLE CLAIMING TO BE THE RIGHTFUL CHAIRMAN OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY OF MICHIGAN, AND IT LOOKS LIKE THEY WILL HAVE TWO SEPARATE CONVENTIONS TO TRY TO DETERMINE WHO THESE DELEGATES ARE. BASICALLY, THERE WAS ONE PERSON IN THAT ROLE. SHE IS REPLACED BY PETE HOST, THE CONGRESSMAN BUT WILL NOT GIVE UP THE STATE PARTY MATERIALS. THERE WILL BE LAWSUITS OVER THIS. I AM TRYING TO THINK OF A TERM THAT IS APPROPRIATE FOR MORNING TELEVISION AND I WILL JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT. >>. YOU PAINTED A GOOD PICTURE HERE. THERE WE GO, JOHN. THANK YOU SO MUCH. >>>. TRUMP CONTINUES TO HIT THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL AND HIS LEGAL TEAM HAS OFFICIALLY FILED PAPERWORK TO BEGIN APPEALING THAT JUDGMENT HANDED TO HIM EARLIER THIS MONTH IN NEW YORK. THE FACT THAT PENALTY WAS THE CULMINATION OF A MONTH'S LONG TRIAL LED BY JAMES ACCUSING THE PRESIDENT OF OVERSTATING HIS COMPANY'S ASSETS IN ORDER TO SECURE FAVORABLE LOAN AND INSURANCE POLICIES. THE $454 MILLION PENALTY FIGURE INCLUDES THE INTEREST THAT HAS ACCRUED SINCE THE RULING ON FRIDAY. MR TRUMP IS ALSO BARRED FROM RUNNING ANY BUSINESS IN NEW YORK FOR THREE YEARS. >>. ANGELA, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THE TRUMP TEAM WANTS AN APPEALS COURT TO DETERMINE IF, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE JUDGE COMMITTED ERRORS IN LAW, WALK US THROUGH WHAT THAT MEANS, THIS FILING, AND WHAT YOU MAKE OF THE TRUMP TEAM. >>. LET'S BE CLEAR THAT THIS APPEAL IS VERY UNLIKELY TO BE SUCCESSFUL. ALL APPEALS GENERALLY HAVE A VERY SMALL SHOT. IN THIS CASE, THE JUDGE WAS SO THOROUGH IN HIS WRITTEN OPINION TO MAKE SURE NONE OF HIS LEGAL RULINGS WILL BE REVERSED, THAT SAID. I SEE TWO MAIN AREAS. FIRST, THE IDEA THAT THIS BLOCK IS PRIMARY PROTECTION. STATUTE IN THE PAST, IT HAS ONLY BEEN USED AGAINST BUSINESSES AND NEVER APPLIED TO AN INDIVIDUAL. NEVER APPLIED TO AN INDIVIDUAL GIVEN THE SIZE OF A JUDGMENT. FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER IN THE HISTORY OF THE STATUTE, IT COULD BE A BASIS FOR APPEAL. THE SECOND STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS: WE HAVE HEARD HIS TEAM TALK ABOUT THIS EXTENSIVELY. TRUMP WAS DISMISSED DUE TO STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. HIS TEAM WILL KEEP SAYING HE SHOULD BE BARRED FOR THAT SAME REASON. >>. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE MONEY. DOES HE HAVE TO PAY ANY OF IT OR SOME OF IT WHILE HE IS APPEALING? >> YES, HE HAS TO PUT THAT MONEY UP WITHIN A 30 DAY PERIO. WHAT HE CAN DO IS GET A BOND COMPANY TO PUT THAT MONEY UP, BUT THAT SAID. THERE ARE NOT A LOT OF BOND COMPANIES, ESPECIALLY IN NEW YORK, THAT CAN PUT UP A JUDGMENT OF THAT SIZE. SO THERE REMAINS A LARGE QUESTION AS TO HOW THIS MONEY CAN BE PUT UP. WE HEARD MR JAMES SAY THAT IF THIS MONEY IS NOT PUT UP, SHE WILL START SEIZING PROPERTIES. IT IS VERY POSSIBLE THAT HE MAY HAVE TO START SELLING. ALEX JONES AND GIULIANI HAD TO BE FORCED INTO BANKRUPTCY TO SETTLE HUGE SETTLEMENTS. >>. THE MANHATTAN DISTRICT ATTORNEY, ALVIN BRAGG: WE ARE TALKING ABOUT FALSIFIED BUSINESS RECORDS CASE. HE WANTS TO ENTER THIS GAG ORDER ON THE FORMER PRESIDENT. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT? IS THIS TO PROTECT SOMEONE IN PARTICULAR? >>. IT HAS BEEN A PRETTY NARROW GAG ORDER THAT HE HAS REQUESTED FOR THE JURORS, THE WITNESSES AND THE OTHER PROSECUTORS. BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT YOU HAVE TO WAIVE IT AGAINST THE FIRST AMENDMENT, AND THAT IS MASSIVE. WE ALWAYS SEE UNPRECEDENTED BUT THERE HAS NEVER BEEN AN ACTIVE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE WHO COULD BE GAGGED FROM SPEAKING. THESE ARE NOT ANONYMOUS WITNESSES. THIS IS MICHAEL COHEN AS THE STAR WITNESS. HE TALKED EXTENSIVELY AND MADE REMARKS AGAINST TRUMP HIMSELF. SO IT IS UNCLEAR AT WHAT LEVEL THIS JUDGE WILL DECIDE TO EXECUTE THE GAG ORDER. IT IS USED TO THE CONSTITUTION AND ALSO SAFETY >>>. LET'S GET TO THE ISRAEL- HAMAS WAR, WHERE THERE IS NEW HOPE FOR A CEASE-FIRE IN GAZA >>. PRESIDENT BIDEN WAS ASKED ABOUT A LIKELIHOOD OF A PAUSE. HE SAYS HE HOPES TO HAVE A DEAL FOR CEASE-FIRE BY NEXT WEEK >>. WELL, I HOPE BY THE END OF THE WEEKEND. BY THE END OF THE WEEKEND, MY SECURITY ADVISOR TELLS ME THAT WE ARE CLOSE. CLOSE, NOT DONE. YET, MY HOPE IS THAT BY NEXT MONDAY WE WILL HAVE A CEASE-FIRE >>. WE ARE JOINED BY INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT JOSH LETTERMAN IN LONDON. THIS COULD COME AS MEDIATING TALKS BETWEEN ISRAEL AND HAMAS. WHERE DO THINGS STAND WITHIN? A GOOD DOSE AND NEGOTIATION >>. THERE IS A NEGOTIATION INVOLVING ISRAELI OFFICIALS TRYING TO HAMMER THIS OUT BUT AS FAR AS THE SPECIFICS OF THE DEALS GO, THERE ARE QUITE A BIT OF DIFFERENT SCENARIOS THAT ARE FLOATING AROUND OUT THERE. AL JAZEERA IS REPORTING MULTIPLE SOURCES IN WHICH 400 PALESTINIANS WOULD BE EXCHANGED FOR SOME 40 ISRAELIS- ROUGHLY 10 TO 1 RATIO. MITCHELL SPOKE WITH A PERSON WHO SAYS THEY ARE MORE. WHO SAYS THEY ARE MORE DISCUSSION -- DISCUSSING A THREE TO ONE RATIO- AND THE NEW YORK TIMES REPORTING A SMALLER DEAL WHICH IS FIVE ISRAELI FEMALE TROOPS, BEING HELD BY HAMAS, WOULD BE TRADED FOR SOME 15 PALESTINIANS CONVICTED OF SERIOUS TERRORISM OFFENSES. THE DETAILS ARE A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO PIN DOWN, BUT ONE COMMONALITY: SOME CESSATION OF HOSTILITY FOR THE MONTH OF ROBIN ARE, WHICH BEGINS ON MARCH 10th >>. BENJAMIN NETANYAHU HAS SAID THAT- DEAL OR NO DEAL, NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS. HIS FORCES ARE GOING INTO THE SOUTHERN GAZA CITY AND THAT IS WERE. NEARLY 1.5 MILLION PALESTINIANS HAVE SOUGHT STACY -- SAFETY, SINCE THE WAR BEGAN. ARE THERE ANY EVACUATION PLANS BEFORE A PLANNED ASSAULT ON THE CITY? >>. Reporter. THIS HAS BEEN A CONTROVERSY WITH THE REST DEMANDING A CONCRETE PLAN. ISRAEL SAYS IT DOES HAVE A PLAN SUBMITTED BY THE MILITARY YESTERDAY TO THE WAR CABINET. ACCORDING TO ISRAELI OFFICIALS, THEY ENVISION MANY OF THESE PALESTINIANS MOVING INTO THE LARGEST CITY IN SOUTHERN GAZA. IT HAS BEEN THE FOCUS OF INTENSE ISRAELI BOMBARDMENT. ONCE THAT IS CLEARED OUT. THE IDEA IS THAT MANY PEOPLE IN ROUGHER COULD GO TO A RECENTLY REOPENED UNIT BUT ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE EXPECTED TO STAY IN THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF THE GAZA STRIP. ISRAEL IS NOT EXPECTING TO LET THEM GO BACK TO THEIR HOMES IN THE NORTH, IN THE MEANTIME. THE US HAS NOT SEEN ANY KIND OF A CONCRETE PLAN FROM ISRAEL >>. IN NORTHERN GAZA, THERE IS GROWING CONCERN, GROWING CONCERN. WHAT IS THE LATEST? >> HUMANITARIAN AID ACTUALLY DROPPED BY 50%. THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IS GROWING VERY FAST. COUNTRIES ARE TRYING TO STEP UP AND CREATE WAYS, INCLUDING JORDAN, WHICH IS STARTED AIRDROPPING SHIPMENTS INTO THE GAZA STRIP FROM AIRCRAFT. TWO DAYS >>>. THE US AIRMEN WHO SET HIMSELF ON FIRE IN AN APPARENT PROTEST AGAINST THE ISRAEL HAMAS WAR HAS DIED, IDENTIFIED AS ERIN BUSHNELL, CALLING AS ERIN BUSHNELL, CALLING ISRAEL'S WAR GENOCIDE AND YELLING FREE PALESTINE BEFORE COLLAPSING TO THE GROUND IN WASHINGTON DC >>>. THE AIR FORCE CONFIRMS HE WAS A CYBER DEFENSE OPERATION SPECIALIST, SERVING AS A SENIOR AIRMAN AS PART OF AN INTELLIGENCE UNION BASED OUT OF TEXAS. THE AIR FORCE SAYS THE EXACT DETAILS ARE STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION. >>> A PARTIAL GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN BY THE END OF THE WEEK? >>. THIS MORNING, PRESIDENT BIDEN IS MEETING WITH THE TOP FOUR CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS AT THE WHITE HOUSE TO PUSH FOR A DEAL AIMED AT AVERTING A SHUTDOWN. THE PRESIDENT IS EXPECTED TO PRESSURE LAWMAKERS TO PASS THE BILL, WHICH INCLUDES AID FOR ISRAEL AND UKRAINE. >>. JOINING US NOW OUR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT. GOOD MORNING. JULIE WALK US THROUGH THE UPCOMING DEADLINES AND WHAT IS AT STAKE HERE. >> JUST A COUPLE OF DAYS AWAY. ON FRIDAY, YOU HAVE THE FIRST DEADLINE, BECAUSE THE SPEAKER PUT IN THAT LETTER. TWO STEP SHUTDOWN DEADLINE, WHICH MAKES THIS SO MUCH MORE COMPLICATED. COMING UP FRIDAY, YOU HAVE TO SHUT DOWN THE AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT, ENERGY AND HOUSING, AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, VETERANS, AFFAIRS AND TRANSPORTATION. THAT IS ABOUT ONE FOURTH, MARCH 8, IF THEY DON'T MEET THAT DEADLINE. THEN YOU HAVE THE SHUTDOWN OF OTHER MATTERS, LIKE JUDICIARY AND OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES. CERTAINLY, THIS IS A BIG DEAL AND A PARTIAL GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN AFFECTS MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AND MILLIONS OF WORKERS ALREADY PUTTING OUT THERE PLAN IN CASE OF A SHUTDOWN WHERE LAWMAKERS CANNOT COME TO AN AGREEMENT >>. ARE WE LIKELY TO GET A DEAL BY MARCH 1st. >>. OUR VIEWERS KNOW THAT COUNTDOWN THEY HAVE BEEN SEEING ALL YEAR LONG BECAUSE OF POLICY DIFFERENCES BUT IN THIS CASE IT SEEMS LIKE- THIS IS MORE POLITICAL- BETWEEN SENATE AND HOUSE THAT HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THESE BILLS FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS BUT THE SPEAKER HAS A LOT OF PRESSURE FROM HARDLINERS. YESTERDAY WE HEARD FROM THE FLOOR THAT THE HOUSE ISN'T EVEN BACK UNTIL TOMORROW EVEN THOUGH SPEAKER JOHNSON IS GOING TO THE WHITE HOUSE TODAY. TAKE A LISTEN. >>. I HOPE THE HOUSE CONTINUES TO WORK WITH US IN GOOD FAITH TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. BUT TIME IS SHORT, IT IS SHORT. >>. WE HAVE THE MEANS AND JUST ENOUGH TIME THIS WEEK TO AVOID A SHUTDOWN AND MAKE SURE THERE IS HEADWAY ON THE ANNUAL APPROPRIATIONS. BUT AS ALWAYS THE TASK AT HAND WILL REQUIRE THAT EVERYONE ROSE IN THE SAME DIRECTION >>. THAT WAS REPUBLICAN LEADER McCONNELL ON THE BACKSIDE, CHUCK SCHUMER AND McCONNELL LITERALLY ON THE SAME PAGE. THEY DON'T WANT TO SHUT DOWN. SOURCES TELL ME THAT SPEAKER JOHNSON DOESN'T WANT ONE EITHER. THE PROBLEM IS THEY DO WANT THAT YEAR-LONG STOPGAP MEASURE TO KICK IN IN APRIL AND THAT MEANS 1% CUTS ALL ACROSS THE AGENCY, SOMETHING THAT McCARTHY NEGOTIATED WITH PRESIDENT BIDEN LAST SPRING. THERE IS A LOT GOING ON AND WE WILL SEE IF THEY CAN GET THERE BY FRIDAY'S DEADLINE BUT A SHUTDOWN WILL NOT BE GOOD FOR ANYBODY. >>. LET'S BRING IT IN FROM THE PRESIDENT PERSPECTIVE. WHAT WILL HIS MESSAGE BE ON THE SHUTDOWN? >>? THE WHITE HOUSE HAS SUGGESTED THAT FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IS THE HARDLINER PUTTING HIS THUMB ON THE SCALE TO GET THESE MEASURES PASSED THROUGH. CONGRESS HAVE BEEN SLOW AND I THINK WHAT WE WILL SEE IS PRESIDENT BIDEN AND HARRIS JOINING TOGETHER WITH THE TOP CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS OF THE WHITE HOUSE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION. THE PRESIDENT INTENDS TO PUSH CONGRESS, TO TRY TO GET SOMETHING DONE AND MOVE THESE BILLS THAT WOULD DEFUND THE GOVERNMENT BEYOND THE FIRST DEADLINE ON FRIDAY, AND THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO TALK ABOUT NATIONAL SECURITY. WE KNOW THERE HAS BEEN A MEASURE PASSED IN THE SENATE THAT WOULD PROVIDE FUNDING FOR UKRAINE, FOR ISRAEL, FOR THE BORDER, AND NOW THERE IS A SEPARATE EFFORT BUT IT SEEMS AS THOUGH THE WHITE HOUSE FEELS LIKE. THESE ARE THINGS THAT CONGRESS NEEDS, ARE THINGS THAT CONGRESS NEEDS TO GET DONE. IT IS ON CONGRESS TO DO THE WORK TO GET THESE BILLS PASSED, THESE MEASURES PASSED, AND TO KEEP WORKING. BUT THE WHITE HOUSE KNOWS THAT THE PRESIDENT IS ONE WHO FEELS AS THOUGH HE CAN BRING PEOPLE AROUND THE TABLE AND SORT OF TALK THROUGH SOME OF THE HARD POINTS AND CREATE SOME RECONCILIATION TO TRY TO GET THE BALL MOVING. WE DON'T KNOW THAT THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER FACTORS AT PLAY HERE THAT IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHAT EXACTLY THE PRESIDENT WILL DO. WE HAVE ASKED ABOUT THE STRATEGY GOING INTO TODAY'S MEETING AND WE HAVE NOT GOTTEN A RESPONSE, ONE THAT SAYS IT IS TIME TO GET SOMETHING DONE, AND THE PRESIDENT WILL MAKE THAT POINT TODAY BEFORE HE GOES TO THE BORDER AND TALKS MORE ABOUT NATIONAL SECURITY THIS WEEK, AND WE WILL HEAR STATE OF THE UNION NEXT WEEK >>. WE ALSO EXPECT THE PRESIDENT TO BRING UP A NATIONAL SECURITY BILL STILL STRUGGLING TO GET THROUGH THE HOUSE. WHAT MORE CAN WE EXPECT THERE? >>. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT EVERY MEMBER OF THE ADMINISTRATION WHO MAKES A PUBLIC APPEARANCE HAS REALLY TAKEN TIME TO SAY. THIS IS A MAJOR ISSUE THAT THE UNITED STATES NEEDS TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT FOR OUR OWN PURPOSES AND FOR LOCAL SECURITY. THERE IS THE NEED TO PASS THE SECURITY SUPPLEMENT TO GET UKRAINE WEAPONS AS IT STARTS TO FALTER AGAIN AGAINST RUSSIA AND THE NATIONAL SECURITY FUNDING PORTION. THAT WOULD AFFECT ISRAEL IN TERMS OF PROVIDING MILITARY ASSISTANCE AND, PERHAPS, MORE IMPORTANTLY, WOULD CREATE SOME AVENUES FOR HUMANITARIAN AID TO BE INCREASED FROM THE UNITED STATES GOING INTO GAZA TO HELP THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE. SO THERE IS A LOT ON THE PRESIDENT'S AGENDA AND WE HOPE TO HEAR FROM THE WHITE HOUSE THIS AFTERNOON WHEN THE PRESS SECRETARY SPEAKS POTENTIALLY FROM THE CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS AS THEY LEAVE THE MEETING. THERE WILL BE A CAMERA RIGHT OUTSIDE THE WEST WING >>> A SEVERE STORM RISK STRETCHING FROM MISSOURI TO MICHIGAN. WE WILL CHECK ON THE WEATHER. >>. A GOOD CHUNK OF THE MIDWEST IS INCLUDED IN THIS THREAD THAT WE CAN SEE THE AFTERNOON EVENING AND OVERNIGHT HOURS. 41 MILLION PEOPLE AND YOU CAN SEE SOME MAJOR CITIES- ST LOUIS, CHICAGO, LOUISVILLE- ALL INCLUDED IN THAT FLIGHT RISK FOR HAIL UP TO GOLF BALL SIZED WIND GUSTS UP TO 60 MILES AN HOUR AND NOT RULING OUT THE POTENTIAL FOR A FEW TORNADOES. THE POTENTIAL IS THERE FOR THIS TO OCCUR AFTER DARK. WE KNOW HOW DANGEROUS TORNADOES ARE. HERE IS THE DEAL. IT IS A BIG ONE, POWERFUL AND MOVING ACROSS THIS REGION OVER THE NEXT DAY OR SO TOMORROW. YOU CAN SEE THE HEAVY RAIN AND SNOW THAT WILL TRACK ACROSS THE UNITED STATES AND WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE EAST COAST BEING IMPACTED LOTS OF SEVERE WEATHER, RAIN AND SNOW AS WE GET INTO WEDNESDAY. BEHIND IT, MUCH COLDER CONDITIONS IN -- A ROLLER COASTER RIDE OF TEMPERATURES OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS, AND WE HAVE A LOT OF CHANGES IN REGARDS TO THAT. WE ALSO HAVE SOME GOOD SOAKING RAIN FOR SOME FOLKS, WIDESPREAD AMOUNTS .25 INCHES TO .5 INCHES, IN SOME SPOTS AN INCH OR TWO INCHES. BY WEDNESDAY WE HAVE ONE OUT WEST, NOT QUITE AS MANY AS THESE WINTER ALERTS MAINLY FOCUSED ACROSS PORTIONS OF THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST, WHERE THE HEAVY RAIN IS GOING TO BE A BIG ISSUE. ONCE AGAIN, WE GOT WIND THAT WE WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH FOR PARTS OF OREGON AND WASHINGTON, AND WE WILL SEE THIS WORKING INTO THE REGION AS WE GET INTO WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, NOTICE THE SNOW THAT WILL BE DRAPED ACROSS THE MOUNTAIN REGIONS. WE COULD SEE ANYWHERE, FROM AN INCH TO TWO INCHES AN HOUR, AND THAT MEANS TRAVEL WILL BE DIFFICULT AND NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR SOME REGIONS, ESPECIALLY THE MOUNTAIN ROADS, AND WE WILL PICK UP A GOOD AMOUNT OF THE SNOW. FOUR TO SIX FEET IS THE LIKELY AMOUNT HIGHER ELEVATIONS. THIS IS SOMETHING WE WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH AS WE GET INTO THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS, AND THEY HAVE HAD NO REST. WHEN IT COMES TO DIFFICULT WEATHER, WE WILL HAVE THIS NEXT SYSTEM THAT IMPACTS THEM. UP TO 12 FEET OF SNOW IS POSSIBLE ACROSS THE SIERRA RANGE, MOUNT WHITNEY INCLUDED, AND THE RAIN IS A LITTLE DIFFICULT AFTER THREE TO FIVE INCHES OF RAIN AND IT WILL BE IMPACTFUL FOR FOLKS IN THAT REGION. 12 FEET- IT IS GOING TO BE A DIFFICULT ONE. WE SAY OFTENTIMES, DIFFICULT TRAVEL BUT THAT WILL BE NEAR IMPOSSIBLE. >>>. MUCH MORE TO COME ON. MORNING NEWS NOW CALLING OUT. MORNING NEWS NOW CALLING OUT A NEW SURVEY SHOWS: GEN ZERS. >>> KENSINGTON PALACE AFTER THE BREAK: >>> WELCOME BACK. HUNDREDS OF >>> WELCOME BACK.

EARLIER THIS MONTH, A POLITICAL STANDOFF LEFT NO SOLUTION ON THE TABLE. THE BIPARTISAN DEAL HOUSE, REPUBLICANS UNWILLING TO FREE UP FUNDS WITHOUT SWEEPING CHANGES IN POLICY. >> REPUBLICANS CANNOT VOTE FOR THE WILL IN GOOD CONSCIOUS -- BILL IN GOOD CONSCIOUS >>. Reporter. SAYING IN PART: WHEN IT COMES TO BORDER SECURITY, THE REPUBLICAN CONGRESS HAS DONE NOTHING BUT SABOTAGE ANY ATTEMPTS AT PROGRESS.

IT IS NATIONAL EATING DISORDERS AWARENESS WEEK: A TIME FOR HEALTH PROFESSIONALS, ORGANIZATIONS AND THE COMMUNITY TO RAISE AWARENESS ABOUT EATING DISORDERS, THEIR IMPACTS, POSSIBLE TREATMENT AND SUPPORT THAT IS AVAILABLE, ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL ALLIANCE FOR EATING DISORDERS. MORE THAN 29 MILLION AMERICANS WILL EXPERIENCE AN EATING DISORDER IN THEIR LIFE >>. RESEARCHERS HAVE FOUND THAT EVERY 52 MINUTES SOMEONE LOSES THEIR LIFE COMPLICATIONS FROM AN EATING DISORDER. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US TO TALK ABOUT THIS. FIRST OF ALL, IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THERE ARE DIFFERENT TYPES OF EATING DISORDERS. TELL US ABOUT THAT AND WHICH DEMOGRAPHICS SEEM TO BE IMPACTED. >>. ONE OUT OF NINE AMERICANS WILL EXPERIENCE AN EATING DISORDER AT SOME TIME IN THEIR LIFETIME. LIFETIME ANOREXIA, BULIMIA, AVOIDING RESTRICTIVE FOOD INTAKE DISORDER, WHICH HAPPENS PRIMARILY IN CHILDREN, MORE LIKE A PICKY EATER BUT A MANIFESTATION OF ANXIETY OR FEAR AROUND THE ACT OF EATING. WE ALSO KNOW THAT EATING DISORDERS DO NOT DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN AGE, GENDER, RACE, CLASS, SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS, SEXUAL IDENTITY, ABILITY, BODY SHAPE AND SIZE ON THE WHOLE. YOU MAY NOT EVEN KNOW THAT AN EATING DISORDER IS THERE. DESPITE LOOKING AT THE INDIVIDUAL, ALSO REPORTING ON HOW IT IS DIFFICULT IN SOME CASES WHEN YOU MENTION GENDER FOR TO BE DIAGNOSED, BECAUSE THERE ARE NOT A LOT OF PARAMETERS I KNOW LGBTQ COMMUNITIES AND MINORITIES ARE ALSO AT RISK. TELL US HOW THESE DIFFERENT SUBSETS ARE IMPACTED. >>. WE LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE WE HAVE THAT ARCHAIC STEREOTYPE, WHERE EATING DISORDERS A FEMALE, IDENTIFIED BODY, MALE AND UPPER-CLASS BUT SO MANY INDIVIDUALS AND MARGINALIZED IDENTITIES ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE IDENTIFIED AND MOST ABSENT ON TO TREATMENT. WE KNOW THAT INDIVIDUALS IN THE TRANS COMMUNITY ARE FOUR TIMES MORE LIKELY GOING TO DEVELOP AN EATING DISORDER THAN THEIR COUNTERPARTS. >>. WHAT ARE THE MISCONCEPTIONS? >> EATING DISORDERS ARE A CHOICE. WHEN I TELL PEOPLE THAT EATING DISORDERS ARE BIOLOGICAL BRAIN ELEMENTS OR IF THEY ARE HEREDITARY AND RUN IN FAMILIES, WE KNOW THAT EATING DISORDERS IS A COMBINATION OF GENETICS AND ENVIRONMENT VERY BODY CENTRIC, AND WHEN YOU HAVE THOSE GENES THAT COME TOGETHER, EATING DISORDERS WILL DEVELOP. EXPECT. IF SOMEONE IS SUFFERING OR YOU THINK THAT SOMEONE YOU CARE ABOUT IS HAVING A HARD TIME, HOW DO YOU APPROACH THE CONVERSATION? >> LEADING WITH COMPASSION AND TALKING TO THE INDIVIDUAL ONE- ON-ONE AND KNOWING THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS ALONE. A FREE HELPLINE MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY, 9:00 UNTIL 7:00, WE CAN HELP TO WALK YOU THROUGH, AND WE HAVE SUPPORT GROUPS FOR NOT ONLY THE INDIVIDUAL BUT THE LOVED ONE AS WELL, EATING DISORDERS NOT ONLY AFFECT THE PERSON GOING THROUGH IT AT THE FAMILY SYSTEM. >> HAVING AN AWARENESS WEEK. WHAT IS THE IMPACT? >> CREATED CONVERSATION ALLOWS INDIVIDUALS STRUGGLING IN SILENCE TO KNOW THAT THEY ARE NOT ALONE AND THAT IT DOES GET BETTER. SOMEONE WHO HAS STRUGGLED FOR 10 YEARS AND NEVER TOLD A SOUL ABOUT IT OR NEVER THOUGHT. THERE WAS LIFE BEYOND EATING DISORDERS. BY HAVING OPPORTUNITIES LIKE THIS ONE, WE ARE SAYING THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE ALONE AND THERE IS HELP, AND THERE IS HOPE, AND RECOVERY IS POSSIBLE. >>. WE APPRECIATE YOU SPENDING SOME TIME WITH US. >>> TIME FOR OUR WEEKLY MENTAL HEALTH CHECK AND HOW CRISIS COULD BE IMPACTING GEN ZERS IN THE WORKPLACE. CALLING OUT SICK MORE OFTEN. >>>. WOULD YOU BRING A DEAD LOVED ONE BACK WITH THE HELP OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, WHY SOME EXPERTS THINK AI GHOSTS COULD DO MORE HARM THAN GOOD. DOCTOR, IT IS GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. LET'S START WITH YOUR REPORT. LET'S START WITH YOUR REPORT SAYING: MEMBERS OF GEN ZERS ARE MORE LIKELY TO CALL OUT FOR A MENTAL HEALTH DAY THEN AN OLDER COWORKER. THIS IS AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS AND YOUNG PEOPLE TELL US WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE AND WHY WOMEN ARE STRUGGLING MORE THAN MEN. MORE THAN MEN. >>. PART OF THIS: UNFORTUNATELY, WHEN WE HAVE SEEN LOTS OF CHANGES AND GROWTH IN SO MANY WAYS BUT SO MANY WOMEN ARE EXPERIENCING A LOT OF BACKLASH, WHERE IT MIGHT BE- HEART CONDITIONS, HEALTHWISE OPPORTUNITIES TO GROW AND EXCEL AS WELL AS AN INCREASED MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGE, A LOT OF WOMEN ARE OVERWHELMED, ESPECIALLY AT THIS YOUNG AGE, AND WE NEED TO CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO GET THE CARE THEY NEED AND NOT FEEL THE STIGMA >>. LET'S TALK ABOUT AI GHOSTS. RESEARCHERS ARE PREDICTING THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DIGITALLY RE-CREATE THE PERSONA OF SOMEONE WE LOVE, WHO HAS PASSED AWAY, USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. MOST OF US WOULD LOVE TO SHARE ONE MORE CONVERSATION WITH SOMEONE WE LOVE AND LOST, BUT I HAVE TO GUESS THERE ARE RISKS >>. IT IS VERY TEMPTING THE THOUGHT OF RE-CREATING A MEMORY OF SOMEONE THAT YOU LOST BUT THE CHALLENGE IS THAT IT MIGHT NOT ALLOW YOU TO GO TO THE NATURAL GRIEVING PROCESS WHERE YOU GO THROUGH THE UPS AND DOWNS AND THE REALLY TOUGH MOMENTS. IN PLACE OF ACCEPTANCE OF THE LOSS OF THAT LOVED ONE AND THIS AI-GENERATED MEMORY COULD CREATE MOMENTS OF ANXIET ALONENESS OR EVEN DEPENDENCE, WHERE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU NEED TO HAVE THIS PERSON AROUND AND NOT BE INVOLVED WITH THE PROCESS OF GRIEVING. EXPECT, DOCTOR, THERE IS A NEW TIKTOK TREND CALLED A 90-DAY DINNER. IF YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE TIME, SCHEDULE A DINNER WITH YOUR FRIENDS IN THE FUTURE AND BY THE TIME THE DEBTOR COMES AROUND, THINGS HAVE IMPROVED. YOU ARE IN A DIFFERENT PHASE. TELL US WHY AN IDEA LIKE THIS CAN SHIFT OUR PERSPECTIVE AND BE AN EFFECTIVE WAY OF GETTING THROUGH A TOUGH TIME >>. I LOVE THIS BECAUSE IT TALKS ABOUT OUR COMMUNITY, THAT WE CAN CREATE AND BEING ABLE TO SAY: I AM IN A TOUGH MOMENT. BUT I AM GOING TO SEE THE FUTURE IN 90 DAYS AND I AM GOING TOGETHER DAYS, AND I AM GOING TOGETHER WITH MY FRIENDS AND THEY ARE GOING TO HELP ME. BREAK IT DOWN, OR I AM GOING TO KNOW THAT SOMETHING HAS CHANGED AND I WILL BE ABLE TO FEEL BETTER BECAUSE I HAVE COMMUNITY AND THE PEOPLE I LOVE AND I WON'T FEEL SO LONELY AND ISOLATED. I WILL DELAY THE PROBLEM RIGHT NOW AND FIX IT IN BETWEEN AND THEN CELEBRATE WITH MY FAMILY. >> WE COULD SCHEDULE ONE EVERY WEEK. >>. DOCTOR JAMES, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. >>>. A NEW STUDY SHEDDING LIGHT ON HOW AMERICANS FEEL ABOUT THEIR MONEY. >>>. WE WILL BREAK DOWN. WHY SO? >>>. WE ARE BACK WITH A NEW STUDY. >>>. WE ARE BACK WITH A NEW STUDY LOOKING TO GET A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW AMERICANS THINK, FEEL AND ACT WITH THEIR MONEY. >>. TWO THIRDS OF AMERICANS HAVE DECREASED SPENDING BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT STATE OF THE ECONOMY. MORE THAN HALF SAY THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT MONEY, EVEN WHEN THEY HAVE ENOUGH. WHAT HAS AMERICANS WORRIED ABOUT FINANCE? >> MORE ON WHAT AMERICANS ARE THINKING WHEN IT COMES TO THEIR MONEY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. IT IS GREAT TO BE HERE. >>. I AM HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT THE. >>. I AM HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT THE WELLS FARGO START. THERE IS AN INCONSISTENCY BETWEEN THE ECONOMIC DATA WE SEE AND HOW AMERICANS ARE FEELING IN THEIR POCKETBOOK WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THIS IDEA OF MONEY. IT IS CONSTRAINING THEM AND IT IS MAKING THEM MAKE VERY TOUGH TRADE-OFFS ALL THE WAY TO THIS IDEA OF NOT HAVING MUCH LEFT OVER FOR EXTRAS. WE KNOW INFLATION IS HIGHER THAN IT HAS BEEN RECENTLY. WE KNOW THAT RATES ARE HIGHER AND BORROWING COSTS ARE HIGHER BUT IT IS CREATING STRESS ON AMERICANS MORE THAN THEY HAVE FELT IN RECENT MEMORY. EVEN TEENAGERS SAY THEY ARE VERY STRESSED-OUT WHEN IT COMES TO MONEY. >>. 57% OF AMERICANS ADMITTED A MENTAL RESET WHEN IT COMES TO FINANCES. WHAT EXACTLY DOES THAT MEAN? >> HOW DO YOU DO THAT? >>. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT A MENTAL RESET, IT IS TOUGH UT. AMERICANS ARE JUDGED BY THEMSELVES AND OTHERS ABOUT HOW THEY ARE SPENDING MONEY- TOO MUCH, TOO LITTLE EVEN. SO THAT THEY ARE COMPELLED TO LIE ABOUT IT. AND TEENAGERS, MORE THAN ADULTS, FEEL COMPELLED TO LIE ABOUT IT. FEEL COMPELLED TO LIE ABOUT HOW MUCH THEIR HOME IS WORTH, COMPELLED TO LIE ABOUT HOW MUCH THEY SAVE OR INVEST. TALKING ABOUT THIS MENTAL RESET, HOW DO YOU GET BEYOND THIS IDEA OF BEING CHALLENGED AND IT BEING DIFFICULT TO TALK ABOUT MONEY AND BEING MORE AUTHENTIC AND SOLUTION ORIENTED, BECAUSE THE MAJORITY SAID THEY DID NOT WANT TO TALK ABOUT PROBLEMS BUT ABOUT SOLUTIONS >>. YOU WOULD THINK SOLUTION WOULD COME TO MAKING A PLAN BUT I KNOW ALSO THAT YOU FOUND WE SPEND AN AVERAGE OF THREE HOURS A WEEK PLANNING FINANCES. TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, I DON'T SPEND THAT MUCH TIME BUT THEN IT ALSO PUT INTO CONTEXT. THAT IS LESS TIME THAN WE SPEND ON SOCIAL MEDIA OR DOING HOUSEHOLD CHORES. WHAT SHOULD WE BE DOING ON A WEEKLY BASIS OR EVEN DAILY? HOW DO YOU INCORPORATE THIS INTO YOUR LIFE? >>. OFTENTIMES, WE THINK ABOUT DOING MORE MONEY STUFF AND LESS OF OTHER STUFF. NINE, THERE WAS GROWING SOCIAL MEDIA, AND SOMETIMES WE GET CAUGHT UP IN THAT, WHICH IS FINE. THE QUESTION IS THAT THREE HOURS WE SPENT PER WEEK, ARE WE DOING IT WITH INTENTIONALITY? THE SURVEY REVEALS, THEY REALIZE, THEY NEED TO BE MORE INTENTIONAL WHEN IT COMES TO MONEY, AND ONE OF THE BIG TIPS: MAKE THINGS AUTOMATIC WHEN IT COMES TO YOUR MONEY AND I WOULD SAY TO BE THE OPPOSITE: LOOKING AT YOUR MONEY. EVERY SINGLE DAY YOU ARE LOOKING AT A MOBILE APP. LOOK AT YOUR MONEY. THAT IS GOOD FOR FRAUD AND SCAMS TO GIVE YOU COMFORT ALL THE WAY INTO LOOKING HOW YOU ARE SPENDING EVERY DAY, SPENDING THE INCREMENTAL CHANGES THAT YOU MAKE, THE SMALL CHANGES OVER A PERIOD THAT IS GOING TO CHANGE YOUR LIFE >>. IT IS INTERESTING BECAUSE IT MAKES YOU THINK ABOUT A BUDGET. PEOPLE, OVERALL, ARE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THEIR MONEY, ONE OF THE BEST TIPS YOU HAVE TO HELP PEOPLE MOVE FORWARD >>. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THAT OPTIMISM, PEOPLE DO RECOGNIZE THE UPS AND DOWNS. WHEN IT COMES TO MONEY, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOU ARE UP OR DOWN, THE KEY THING TWO: FIRST, MAKE SURE YOU ARE ARTICULATING WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH WITH YOUR MONEY. WE HAVE SOMETHING CALLED LIFE, SINK, MANAGE, CREDIT AND DEBT- THE TOP TWO THINGS PEOPLE PUT IN THAT APP AND YOU ALSO WANT TO INSPIRE YOURSELF. YOU CAN UPLOAD PICTURES FROM YOUR OWN PHOTO GALLERY TO INSPIRE YOU TO DO THE THINGS THAT YOU NEED TO DO. WHETHER THAT IS IN AN APP OR ON A PIECE OF PAPER, WRITE IT DOWN AND GET IT OUT OF YOUR HEAD. THE THINGS THAT YOU ARE WORRIED ABOUT AND THE THINGS THAT INSPIRE YOU. PUT IT ON PAPER, USE THOSE PICTURES, PICTURES THAT INSPIRES HUMAN BEINGS. >>> MORE FINANCIAL HEADLINES, THE HIGHS NOT SEEN IN TWO YEAR >> THAT AND OTHER MONEY NEWS >>> GOOD MORNING GETTING A TWO-YEAR HIGH HAVING 57,000 AND LARGER INVESTORS ARE BUYING CRYPTOCURRENCY.

WE WILL BE ABOVE NORMAL. WASHINGTON DC- ABOUT 20 DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL AS WE GET INT TOMORROW. THAT, OF COURSE DOESN'T LAS EITHER. WE SEE THE MORE MILD CONDITION SETTLING IN. WE ROUND OUT THE WORK WEEK AND HEAD INTO THE WEEKEND. ONE NOTE: IT STAYS MILD ON THURSDAY AND FRIDAY, LOOK WHERE WE GO. BY SATURDAY WE ARE BACK TO THE 60s. TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE 50s. AN BACK TO THE 60s ON FRIDAY, UPPER 70s ON FRIDAY WE WILL SEE AGAIN THE ONLY WA, TO PUT IT A ROLLER COASTER RIDE OF TEMPERATURES. WE ARE IN THE 50s BY THURSDAY. DALLAS IS DEALING WITH 80s AND CLOSE TO 90s EARLIER IN TH WEEK. BACK TO 70s ON FRIDAY AND LO 80s RETURN TO DALLAS BY TH WEEKEND. SO A BIT OF CHANGING KIND OF PATTERN HERE OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS AND WE WILL NEED THE PARKAS BU, MAYBE NOT FOR VERY MUCH LONGER. HERE'S THE DEAL WITH ALL OF THE HEAT. WE HAVE FUEL, THAT THE POWERFUL STORM SYSTEM IS WORKING ACROSS PARTS OF THE MIDWEST. THAT IS LEAVING US WITH TH POTENTIAL OF THE STRONG STORMS TO DEVELOP IN THE EVENING HOURS. WE HAVE A BIGGER RANGE OF WHAT TO EXPECT. WE HAVE CITIES LIKE DETROIT, CHICAGO, LOUISVILLE INCLUDED. THE BIGGEST THREAT IS HAIL. UP TO GOLF BALL SIZE. WE COULD SEE WINDS UP TO 6 MILES PER HOUR OR GREATER. WE CAN'T RULE OUT TORNADOE, WHICH ARE RARE FOR THIS SECTIO OF THE COUNTRY DURING THIS TIM OF YEAR, BUT OF COURSE NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION. HERE'S THE STORM SYSTEM. WE WIL WATCH. IT WILL ALSO BRING RAIN, SNOW- NOT ALL THAT IMPRESSIVE AMOUNT OF EITHER, BUT IT WILL SLOW. YOU DOWN FOR THE TRAVEL AS YOU GET INTO TOMORROW FOR THE SECOND HALF OF THE DAY IN PORTIONS OF THE EAST COAST, A LITTLE SOGGY ON THE ROADS, THE COOLER AIR WILL START TO WORK IN. HERE'S THE FORECAST FOR THE MI WEEK: INCH TO TWO INCHES, WE WILL SEE RAIN AND SNOW. OU WEST, 7 MILLION PEOPLE INCLUDED IN THE ALERTS, FROM THE ROCKIES TO THE CASCADES AND SIERRAS. THAT'S WHERE WE WILL WATCH FOR ONCE AGAIN, TROUBLESOME WEATHE IN THE REGION. WE HAVE ANOTHER STORM SYSTEM THAT WILL WORK ON SHORE HERE TOMORROW IT FOCUSES ON THE NORTHWEST WASHINGTON. OF COURSE, AS WE GE INTO TOMORROW, THIS WILL LAST THROUGH. THURSDA TOO HEAVY RAIN, STRONG WINDS. TH CLOSER TO THE COAST, THE STRONGER THE WINDS WILL BE. WE HAVE ALERTS FOR FOLKS. WE WILL SEE IMPRESSIVE SNOWFAL AMOUNTS- AN INCH TO TWO INCHES PER HOUR AND PROLONGED PERIODS IN PARTS OF THE CASCADES AND SIERRAS. LIKELY TO SEE IMPRESSIVE SNOWFALL. BIGGER PICTURE LOOK, I THINK, TWO FEET, FOUR FEET, UP TO SIX FEE. IN THE LOWER ELEVATIONS WE COULD SEE UP TO 12 FEET O SNOW ACROSS THE SIERRA MOUNTAINS. THAT, OF COURSE, WILL PRESENT PROBLEM WHEN IT COMES TO TRAVELLING IN THE MOUNTAIN ROADS. WE HAVE SEEN IT TIME AND TIM AGAIN THIS WINTER. JUST A REMINDER THAT IF YO THOUGHT WINTER WAS OVER, IT IS NOT. WE STILL HAVE A LITTLE TASTE O SUMMER TO DEAL WITH IN THE SOUTH TODAY AND THEN MORE SNOW OUT WEST. >>. NO DANCING IN THE MOUNTAINS THERE >>. THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE. >> GOOD ADVICE, THANK YOU. >>>.

OKLAHOMA LEADS THE NATION WITH BILLS TARGETING LGBTQ PEOPLE WITH 54 RIGHT. NOW THE STUDENTS SAY THERE IS PERVASIVE CLIMATE OF PULLYING AT THE SCHOOL AND THEY SAY THAT CONTRIBUTED TO NEX'S DEATH. >>. WE UNDERSTAND ABOUT 4 STUDENTS TOOK PART IN TH WALKOUT. TELL US ABOUT IT AND HOW THE SCHOOL RESPONDED. >> SURE, THE WALKOUT WAS PEACEFUL AND MOSTLY QUIET, EXCEPT WHEN BUS DRIVERS WOULD DRIVE-BY AND HON THEIR HORNS, BUT THE WALKOUT ORGANIZERS SAI THE MESSAGE WASN'T REALL POLITICAL. THEY JUST WANTED TO DRAW ATTENTION TO THE BULLYING AT AWAUSO, WHICH, THEY SAY, OFTEN GOES UNPUNISHED AND LEADS TO STUDENTS NOT ASKING FOR HELP. THE SCHOOL SAYS THEY TAK REPORTS OF BULLYING VERY SERIOUSLY AND THEY HAVE POLICIES IN PLACE TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES. AND ALL INCIDENTS AR INVESTIGATED BY TH ADMINISTRATOR AT THE SITE AT WHICH THEY CURE AND ARE REVIEWED BY THE DIRECTOR OF SAFETY AN SECURITY >>. THERE IS NEWLY RELEASEDED BODY CAM VIDEO AND NEX CLAIMS HE WAS JUMPED AN AFTER INCIDENT I THE BATHROOM. WHAT ELSE CAN YOU TELL US ABOU THE VIDEO? >>. SURE, IN THE VIDEO NEX SAID THA THREE GIRLS HAD BEEN BULLYIN HIM AND HIS FRIEND, AND HE DIDN'T REPORT IT TO THE SCHOOL BECAUS HE FELT THERE WAS NO POINT. AFTER THE GIRLS MADE A COMMENT ABOUT HIM AND HIS FRIENDS, H THREW WATER AT HIM AND THREE STUDENTS JUMPED HIM. IN RESPONSE THEY FOUGHT. HE BLACKED OUT AT SOME POINT. THE VIDEO DOESN'T SO US TH ACTUAL FIGHT. YOU JUST SEE STUDENTS WALK OUT OF THE BATHROOM AT THE END. SO THERE IS A LOT OF UNANSWERE QUESTIONS HERE. >>. A LOT OF QUESTIONS. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR REPORTING. WE WANT TO NOTE THAT IF YOU OR ANYONE YOU KNOW IS STRUGGLING. YOU CAN CALL OR TEXT THE CRISI LIFE LINE AT 988 >>>. LET'S SWITCH GEARS HERE TO CASES OF THE NOROVIRUS. THEY HAVE BEEN SURGING ACROS THE COUNTRY THIS COLD SEASON >>. IN THE NORTHEAST, WE AR SEEING A SERIOUS SPIKE. AN AVERAGE OF 13% OF NOROVIRUS TESTS HAVE COME BACK POSITIV SINCE JANUARY, MORE THAN ANY OTHER PART OF THE COUNTRY. OUR MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR, DR KAVITA PATEL, IS JOIN US NOW WITH MORE ON WHAT WE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THIS. LET'S START WITH THE BASICS: WHAT IS THE NOROVIRUS AND WHY DO WE THINK WE ARE SEEING MOR CASES IN THE NORTHEAST THA ANYWHERE ELSE RIGHT NOW >>. IT IS A VERY COMMON VIRUS. IT TENDS TO BE SEASONAL. WE SEE IT RIGHT ABOUT NOW. THIS IS THE PEAK TIME FOR IT. IT LASTS UNTIL ABOUT APRIL. IT IS A COMMON STOMACH VIRUS. SOME PEOPLE CALL IT THE STOMAC FLU. IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH TH FLU VIRUS. IT IS ITS OWN VIRUS. THE SYMPTOMS ARE VOMITING DIARRHEA, STOMACH PAIN, AN, ESPECIALLY IN YOUNGER AND OLDE PEOPLE. IT CAN BE SO SEVERE THAT IT LEADS TO BE DEHYDRATED. THERE IS NOT A CURE OR TREATMENT OTHER THAN SUPPORTIVE THERAPY, HYDRATION AND REST. IT AND IT IS SUPER CONTAGIOUS, SO IT HAPPENS PERSON TO PERSON OR CONTAMINATED FOOD. WASHING FOODS, FRUITS, VEGETABLES AND WASHING YOUR HANDS CAN HELP TO STOP THE SPREAD OF NOROVIRUS. >> GIVE US THE HAND. WASHING TI NOW. >> I'M SETTING YOU UP FOR THIS, SING HAPPY BIRTHDAY TWICE TO YOURSELF OR TO SOMEONE ELSE. THAT IS HOW YOU GET IN AT LEAS 20 SECONDS. >>. I THOUGHT YOU MAY HAVE A NE SONG. >>. WE KNEW THAT ONE. >> OKAY, FINE, WE WILL DO ANOTHER ONE. I WILL GET A TAYLOR SWIFT SONG. >> PLEASE, THANK YOU. >>. EVEN THOUGH, THIS IS NOT RELATED TO THE FLU. I UNDERSTAND. IT CAN BE SEASONAL, TYPICALLY RISE IN CASES BETWEEN NOVEMBER AND APRIL. WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT. WHY IS THAT AND IS IT SPIKIN MORE THAN NORMAL THIS YEAR? >> YEAH, IT DOES HAVE TO DO WITH SEEING THE VIRUS AT ANY TIME OF INYEA, BUT WE SEE IT IN THE COLDE SPRING MONTHS AND IN THE NORTHEAST. WE ARE GOING THROUGH THE TRANSITION PHASE, WHICH TENDS TO BE ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE THINK TH VIRUS IS MORE POPULAR, AS WELL AS THE FACT THAT FOODS, FRUITS, VEGETABLES. WE DON'T HAVE A LO OF THEM GROWING IN OUR PART OF THE COUNTRY, SO WE ARE GETTING THEM FRO DIFFERENT PLACES AND SOMETIMES WE ARE NOT WASHING THEM AS WELL. THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT ADD UP TO THE SEASONALITY. IN THE END IT IS HORRIBLE. PEOPLE OF COURSE DO NOT WANT T GET THIS. IF YOU DO, YOU CAN STILL GET IT. YOU CAN TRANSMIT THE VIRUS. AFTER SYMPTOMS ARE INVOLVED WHEN YOU FEEL BETTER. YOU AR NOT AS CONTAGIOUS, BUT YOU CA STILL BE CONTAGIOUS AFTE SEVERAL WEEKS. IF YOU HAVE SOMEONE IN THE HOUSE THAT IS SICK, IT IS ALL THE MORE REASON TO FIGURE OUT A SONG SO YOU CAN WASH HANDS AND NOT SHARE ANY UTENSILS. I SHARE CUPS AND SPOONS WITH FAMILY MEMBERS AND IF THEY ARE SICK, IT IS NOT A GOOD IDEA TO DO THAT. >>. IT IS MAKING MY STOMACH HURT. >>. IF YOU THINK IT IS HAPPENIN TO YOU, JUST KNOW THAT IT IS A ABOUT 14% OF THE NORTHEAST AND IT IS HAPPENING IN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. >>. WE HAVE SCHOOLS AND DAY CARES ARE THERE. THINGS SCHOOLS CAN D TO TRY TO PREVENT THE SPREAD >>. YES, AND THEY ARE DOING ALL OF THESE THINGS, BUT IT IS HARD WITH LITTLE CHILDREN BECAUSE THEIR FINGERS ARE EVERYWHERE O THE SURFACES. CLEANING THE SURFACES, AN GETTING RID OF ANY OF TH CONTAMINANTS CAN HELP. IT SOUNDS TERRIBLE, BUT REINFORCING BATHROOM HYGIENE- WHICH TRUST ME. I HAVE A 7-YEAR-OLD AND IT IS NOT EAS BUT IT IS RELATED TO BATHROO AND RECESS BEHAVIOR. IT IS JUST A MATTER OF ISOLATING THE CASES. UNFORTUNATELY, WE HAVE A LOT O OTHER VIRUSES GOING AROUND. FOR MANY PEOPLE THEY ARE LIKE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I HAVE, BUT IF YOU HAVE A VOMITING STOMACH, PAIN AND DIARRHEA, IT IS PROBABLY THE NOROVIRUS AND THERE IS NO TREATMENT. JUST START SUPPORTIVE CARE AND SEEK OUT PROFESSIONAL HELP. I YOU KNOW THAT. YOU ARE NO HYDRATED IA FEEL DIZZY WHEN YOU STAND UP. IF YOU ARE WEAKER THAN NORMAL, THAT'S THE TIME TO RING FOR HELP, TO GET ADDITIONAL AID. >>. I'M GOING TO LIVE IN FEAR, DOCTOR PATEL. THANK YOU SO MUCH. >>. LOTS OF SANITIZER HERE. >>>. NOW TO A DIFFERENT MEDICAL STORY. THAT ASKS THE QUESTION: WHAT IF YOU COULD SLOW DOWN TH AGING PROCESS AND LIVE NOT ONL LONGER BUT HEALTHIER? A NEW LAB IS ON THE FOREFRONT OF THE WORK NOW. >>.

WE DO STRUCTURAL, MOLECULAR W SPRINKLE IN A LITTLE AI AS WEL, WHICH GIVES US AN OVERAL PICTURE OF WHAT YOUR BIOLOGICA AGE IS. >>. Reporter.

YOU KNOW PEOPLE IN THE FAMILY AND YOUR LIFE THAT SEEM LIKE THEY DON'T AGE, OR PEOPLE THA AGE MORE RAPIDLY THAN OTHERS. THAT MAY BE MODFIABLE >>. Reporter.

THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION AND A BIPARTISAN GROUP OF NINE ATTORNEYS GENERAL ARE SUING TO TRY TO BLOCK A PROPOSED MERGER BETWEEN TWO OF THE LARGEST DPROESRY STORE CHAINS IN THE US. >>. RIGHT NOW, KROGER IS THE SECOND LARGEST CHAINBEHIND WALMART. IT HAS PROPOSED $24.6 BILLIO ACQUISITION OF ALBERTSON'S WOULD GIVE. THE COMBINED COMPAN APPROXIMATELY 710,000 WORKERS AT 5,000 STORES WITH ROUGHLY 4,00 PHARMACIES. THE FTC IS WORRIED THAT THIS COULD KILL COMPETITION AND FORCE PRICES HIGHER THAN THEY ARE. >>. DANNY CEVALLOS IS JOINING U NOW TO TALK MORE ABOUT THE CASE. HELP US UNDERSTAND THE GOVERNMENT'S CASE HERE. WHAT ARE THEY WORRIED ABOUT? >> MONOPOLY, WE HAVE A STRANGE SYSTEM. I AMERICA WE SAY: GO OUT THERE AND BE CAPTAINS OF INDUSTRY AND BUILD A COMPANY, BUT DON'T BE TOO GOO, BECAUSE THEN YOU OWN THE INDUSTRY. IF THERE IS NO COMPETITION, THEN THE GOVERNMENT WILL STEP IN AN BREAK YOU UP, AS THEY HAVE DONE IN THE PAST. THE ARGUMENT IS SIMPLY: IF ONE COMPANY OWNS ALL OF THE SUPE MARKETS, THEY HAVE NO INCENTIV TO LOWER PRICES. THEY HAVE NO INCENTIVE TO TREA THEIR EMPLOYEES. WELL, IF THEY ARE THE ONLY GAME IN TOWN, YOU HAVE TO PAY THIS PRICE FOR THIS APPLE AND AS A WORKER, YOU HAVE TO GO WITH WHAT WE AR PAYING YOU, BECAUSE WHERE ELS WILL YOU GO? >>. KROGER SAYS THAT THIS DOE NOT EMBOLDEN OTHER BIGGE COMPANIES. IS THAT A POINT HERE? >>. THAT IS THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN. ANY TIME THEY ARE BEING SUED FOR MONOPOLY. THEY ALSO SAY: WAIT, WE MAY B BIG BUT WE ARE DOING LOTS OF GOOD THINGS. WE BREAK UP THE OWNERSHIP AND THERE ARE OTHER GUEYES OUT THERE THAT ARE JUST AS BIG. THERE ARE OTHER MEGA SUPER MARKET STORES DOING THE SAME THING. IN A SENSE, THE MODERN SUPERMARKET IS SOMETHING THA DIDN'T EXIST 30 OR 40 YEARS AG, WHERE YOU COULD BUY A T-SHIR AND A WATERMELON AND DO YOU BANKING AND GO TO THE PHARMACY. THOSE ARE SERVICES THAT THES MEGA STORES DO OFFER. THE QUESTION IS: AT WHAT POINT DOES ONE COMPANY OWN TOO MUCH OF IT? BECAUSE, CLEARLY, ONCE IT HAPPENS, IF ONE COMPANY OCCUPIES THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY, THEY HAVE NO INCENTIVE TO TREAT EMPLOYEE WELL >>. SO THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THE FTC HAS TRIED TO BLOCK A MERGER. WHAT TYPICALLY HAPPENS. AND WHA IS NEXT >>. OFTEN TIMES THE PARTIES REACH AN AGREEMENT, JUST AS WE WERE TALKING ABOU BEFORE. THEY MAY DEVEST SOME OWNERSHIP OF THE COMPANY. EVEN THE LITIGATION CAN BE DAMAGING TO THE COMPANY. IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY WHICH WAY THE CASES GO. WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO COMPARE IT TOO? ARE AIRLINES LIKE SUPERMARKETS? NO, ARE SUPERMARKETS MERGING WITH XM RADIO? NOW, YOU CAN'T COMPARE THE TWO. EVERY INDUSTRY IS DIFFERENT, O ALMOST. EVERY TIME YOU HAVE A CASE LIKE THIS COME UP. A LOT OF IT IS HYPOTHETICALS, LITERALLY IN THE COMPLAINT. THEY ENGAGE IN A HYPOTHETICAL WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE MERGE DID HAPPEN. YOU ARE DOING AN APOCALYPS SCENARIO ON THE GOVERNMENT'S SIDE. WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE WHA HAPPENED, BUT WE HAVE AN IDEA O WHEN ONE COMPANY OWN EVERYTHING, IT IS USUALLY NO GOOD FOR THE CONSUMER. >>. THANK YOU SO MUCH. >>>.

275,w0OyzGgR3pg,A puppeteer is using her voice to pave the way for future storytellers | Nightly News: Kids Edition,NBC News,2024-03-02 19:18:27+00:00,"[Music] coming up feeling the breeze. hi, my name is Sam and I'm 4 years old and I want to talk about how Wind Blows from the air. we'll take a look at the science behind wind. then sweet tooth explained. also a had Monkey Business. this baby monkey is capturing hearts at one zoo in Oklahoma. plus cereal for a cause. the story behind this seral box Domino chain. we're in North Carolina with details and secrets of a ventriloquist. oh, I'm baby Junebug. Mr ler, we'll introduce you to this Puppeteer who is making history and hoping to inspire a new generation of storytellers. ioud, this is NBC Nightly News Kids edition. welcome back to Nightly News Kids edition. I'm Lester Holt. it's it's great to be with you on a Saturday morning. we have an awesome lineup today: everything from the science behind those sweet Cravings many of us have to a rare birth at one Zoo here in the US. and a little later on we're going to have some fun with Puppeteer and ventriloquist Megan pyus. she'll share some tricks of the trade and you move your hand for each syllable that you're saying. so if you wanted to say basketball, I would say baskball. Bas, did your hand? just take my voice. but let's begin with the weather. parts of the country have been hit by some extreme weather this week- rain, storms, even tornadoes- and one young viewer had this question on his mind. hi, my name is Sam and I'm four years old, and I want to talk about how Wind Blows from the air. all right, Sam, great question. thank you for that. the wind is something all of us experience around the world, no matter where we live. for more on the Wind, we ask our our good friend and meteorologist, Dylan dryer, to explain. wind is air in motion. it's produced by the uneven heating of the Earth's surface by the sun, which drives temperature changes. wind is pretty amazing. it can change the shape of the land, move the clouds, help fly a kite and even cause airplanes to fly faster or slower. wind can also generate clean electricity and help help a sailboat across the ocean. but sometimes the wind can be so strong and scary. let's talk more about it. the sun warms the Earth's surface. the atmosphere warms too. some parts of the Earth receive more direct Rays from the Sun and are usually warmer, such as the equator. other places, like the North and South Poles, receive indirect rays, so the weather there is typically colder. warm air weighs less than cold air and Rises, then cool air moves in and replaces the rising warm air. this movement of air is what makes the wind blow. so what makes winds strong at times and weaker at others? well, it all has to do with air pressure. did you know? we live at the bottom of the atmosphere and the weight of all the air above us is called air pressure? when the air pressure changes, so does the strength of the Wind. wind always blows from high pressure to low press areas to try and create a balance. the greater the difference in pressure, the greater the wind speed, especially when that pressure changes over a short distance. sometimes the wind at the surface can be so strong that it becomes scary. there are many types of weather phenomena that produce high wind, for example hurricanes and tornadoes, or nor easers and severe thunderstorms. these winds can be so strong they can knock down trees and cause damage and sometimes power outages. by the way, did you know that the weather instrument used to measure wind speed is called an anomet? that's a fun word to say, and guess what else? wind can also play an important role in our lives. wind is important and can supply one of the cheapest forms of clean energy in the world. windmills can harness the power of the wind to create electricity and, best of all, the supply of wind is [Music] unlimited. all right, Dylan, great explanation as always. thanks so much. well, some of you might be eating your breakfast right now, or maybe you ate already. I get up early, so by this time of the morning I'm usually in need of a snack. did you know that March 4th is National snack day, from pretzels To Nuts to Something Sweet, who doesn't love a good snack? and it got us thinking just what makes some of of us crave the sweet stuff. our pal, Dr John Torres, takes a look at the science behind a sweet tooth. a sweet tooth, it's not a specific tooth in your mouth. in fact, it has nothing to do with your actual teeth. having a sweet tooth simply means that you're a big fan of sweet foods and often crave them. this is a combination of your body and your brain telling you that you want sugar. and what's even trickier, the more you eat sweets well, the more you end up craving them. a lot of people have a sweet tooth, and that isn't necessarily a bad thing, but you want to be aware of it and not let it make all your decisions. I have a big, big Sweet Tooth I have all my life. so here are some tips that I use that might help you. if I'm craving something sweet, I try reaching for healthier sweet foods like fruits or yogurt instead of candy or ice cream. also, be aware of where sugar hides one sneaky spot? well, drinks like juice and soda. so try to stick with water and milk most of the time and eat and drink slowly. this way you can satisfy that Sweet Craving but consume a bit less sugar. most importantly, moderation is key. this doesn't mean you can never have chocolate or cookies, because where's the fun in that? but you do want to be aware of how much sugar you're eating and make sure you're eating other foods to get the vitamins and proteins you need to stay healthy. on the opposite end of the spectrum, some people crave salty foods like potato chips, and the same tips work here. try to reach for healthier options like peanuts or pretzels, and be mindful of how much salt you're actually eating and remember whether it's sweet or salty. for the most part, it's all okay in moderation, Dr John Torres. thank you all. right time for our Pop Quiz. this week we're talking about geography. the question: New Mexico is one of four states that meet at what is known as the Four Corners. which of the following States is not one of the other three? is it a Nevada, B- Arizona or C- Colorado? I'll give you a few seconds to think about it. okay, time's up. the answer is a Nevada. the Four Corners are New Mexico, Arizona, Utah and Colorado. all of these states are part of a really beautiful part of the country with some amazing scenery. well, turning now to this week's inspiring kids series, one Elementary School in North Carolina is getting a lot of attention for a Serial box chain that went viral, and it was all for a great cause. let's get details from our friend Laura [Applause] Jarrett. this video showing nearly 2800 seral boxes lined up and falling down like dominoes at Clemens elementary school has captured a lot of attention. PTA mom Pharaoh burn recorded and posted the video, and it's gone viral: more than 34 million views so far, 69,000 comments. Farah says she got the idea from a friend. then she went to work mapping out the entire route throughout the school and, with the help of others, the display was built in 5 hours. no practice run needed. it was really fun and it was an experience I'll remember for forever. fourth grader Meritt had the job of starting the chain. I was nervous because I couldn't hear the intercom very well because we were outside, but it was way better because all of my class were like screaming the countdown so I wasn't really nervous. then I was like one box going to fall down and mess the whole thing up and what's going to happen. I knew it would, um, go all the way through- really fun. it was fun cuz after that we had recess. but it wasn't just for fun. there was a purpose behind this massive cereal box chain: to donate to the food pantry to help people who are in need. that's right. students, along with the rest of the Clemens Elementary Community, collected cereal boxes and donated them to the local food pantry. kindergartener Jackson making a direct appeal to his church- I speak on the microphone and tell everybody to donate cereal to the pantry. and everybody did and donated. they did a whopping 400 boxes thanks to Jackson speech alone. the Clemens North Carolina food pantry overcome with joy. 2700 boxes will take us through 3 months. every family that comes for the next 3 months is is guaranteed some breakfast, kids learning some important life lessons. it was fun like, because we get to help our community and have fun at the same time, that giving to people at different places that don't have enough money to like spend on food is very, very helpful. I think all of the children, through their excitement, they're going to remember this and they're going to know what it was like to give back. and in case you're wondering, the school says they're already making plans for the next one. Laura, thanks very much. well, just AE Orange Crush, we're in Oklahoma with DET tals on this rare birth and secrets of a ventriloquist. hey, kids on J, how this Puppeteer found her voice and made history. welcome back to Nightly News Kids edition. I hope you're having a great Saturday. we want to head to Oklahoma now, where the recent birth of a baby monkey is capturing the hearts of America. let's get details from our friend, Erin mcglaughlin. say hello to Farah, one of the newest members of the Oklahoma City Zoo. Farah is the first franois Langer monkey born at the zoo in 26 years to Mom Pam and Dad Ripley strictly on mom's milk at this point, but she does try to eat solid foods. she tries to steal what mom may be eating and she's incredibly strong. she tries to explore, maybe a little more than her mom wants to explore. so we've caught Pam trying to hold on to her. she sat on her tail once in order to kind of keep her close to her. so she's very adventurous already, very brave. so just what makes FR Langer unique? for starters, baby franois lers, like Farah, are born different colors to help them stand out. their babies are born bright, red or orange. mom and dad are black fur with like some white sideburns, and then Farah has a very bright red head. typically their fur changes from reddish orange to Black in 6 months to a year. did you know? in the wild franois lers can be found on cliffs outside of forests and are also known as franois leaf monkeys because of their primary diet they're folivores, which means their diet is made up of mostly leaves, so they have a special stomach that helps them process all those leaves. we give them a lot of brows and a lot of trees here at the zoo to kind of help that. sadly, franois Langer is considered an endangered species in the wild. there's about 2,000 left. about 50% of their population has decreased over the decades. this is due to, like hunting, habitat cat loss. their forests are kind of broken into fragments, which makes it harder to forge and eat and kind of stay together as a troop. thankfully, in some of their natural habitats there are ongoing conservation efforts to help save them- China and Vietnam- and both are actually setting aside special Land, Special Forest, to preserve their home country and then our home range, and then to kind of protect the, the monkeys. as for Farah, she'll continue to test new things while ultimately sticking close to Mom for the next year or so, marking an important milestone for the species and the Oklahoma City Zoo. this is, um the first time that we've actually cared for Fran langers, my team um, so we're we're really excited. I think they're a very understudied primate species, so there's not a lot known about them, so we like learning about them contributing to the species as a whole. a and thanks, what a cutie. well, March marks women's History Month, a time to celebrate the achievements made by females, and there's one young woman who is using her voice and creativity to pave the way for future storytellers, making history and hoping to inspire kids to reach for the stars. [Music]: ioud of me, of me, yay, make you in a world of Make Believe. Megan pyus is bringing her imagination to life. her love of puppetry all started when she was 10. when I was 10 years old. I had just changed to a new elementary school and had to make new friends. I was super shy. I went to a puppetry conference with a few members from my church. I was exposed to women ventriloquist, and I saw myself being able to open up, just like them and- um, make something come alive in that moment. so I went home. I told my parents I wanted to become a ventriloquist. you're the valedictorian, that means you're the Thirsty gold. and guess what she did? just that Tamir and I were working on making a gift for our grandma, Na's birthday in 2021. Megan pus made history becoming sesame Street's first full-time female black Puppeteer. I still don't know what I want to do yet. my goal is just to inspire girls to achieve whatever dream they have, no matter their background, their zip code or no matter the color of their skin. and there's no stopping her achievements. Megan just released a children's album, hoping to inspire all kids to Dream Big Y. I just want to make you proud of me. make you proud of me [Music]. and joining us now is Megan pus. Megan, great to have you on. thank you so much for having me. I didn't catch the name of your friend. oh, I'm baby, June, Mr L year, June bug. I like that name and I like your outfit. by the way, thank you, I was trying to match something. I thought you was going to go here, oh well, yeah, I, mine was in the cleaner, so I just just we your basic black and blue today. but it's great to have you on, Megan, great to have you on. explain to me, you are a puppeteer and a ventriloquist for our kids out there watching right now. can you explain the difference? yeah, me, she a little crazy. no, she got lots of voices. no, so as a puppeteer, I can move puppets, like June bugs, but as a vilis, I can talk without moving my lips. like that, you can talk without moving your Li. that's right. and so when I talk with junbug, I sound like this and Nan's now see like this, and of course, my ey is immediately going toward tune bug. that's right. during this conversation, it brings the character even more so to life because you believe that he's real. yeah, I'm a real boy. yeah, I. I want to get into this how you do it first and to start us off, we've got one of our kid questions, so let's watch here. it is: hi Ma, how do you talk with your mouth closed. how do you talk with your mouth closed? oh yeah, those Nas do it that need you to sit down. I can teach you how. so they're only certain letters of the alphabet that you have to close your mouth for, like B, right, a, you don't have to close your mouth so I can say a on saying a, right now it lips aren moving so you can push out the same amount of air- a, a, and it makes it look like you're not moving your lips. but for B, I replace that letter with another letter of the alphabet that sounds similar like d, b, d, b, d in a sentence. how you do that? so if you wanted to say basketball, replace the B with a d: basketball, basketball, basketball, basketball, kind of that. yep, that's right. yeah, so that. and that applies for basically every letter that we would normally require our lips together. that's right. they rep: we. there's about seven letters that we replace um the letters with. you started this at a really early age. I know you practice a lot. I want to play another question from one of our viewers. okay, hello, my name is Lona and my name is l. we're both from Japan. how do you practice to be a puppeteer. bye, we love Nightly News Kids edition. and this was my point. a lot of work went into where you are today. tell me how much work, what kind of things you have to do. well, I met June buug when I was 12 years old, but I've been a puppeteer since I was 10 years old, so around your age is when I started. you can practice by first taking your own hand. you want to do it with me? GL, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay. so you take your hand and we want to mimic how we move. so open the mouth like this. you don't want to open the entire mouth, cuz then you're hey, Megan and Jun, yeah, like that. so drop your bottom thumb like this. if you move your whole mouth, your your uh puppet will look like this: oh, okay. so it say very slight, just just yeah, slight opening of your bottom thumb, and you move your hand for each syllable that you're saying. so if you wanted to say basketball, I would say basketball, basketball. did your hand? just take my voice. so do that again, because I want to. I want to see the movement of June buug when you. that's get, okay, this is: I like to play desket ball. you like to play Desk desket ball. I'm not very good, but I'm not very good being a FR. tril, as we mentioned earlier, you landed your dream job on Sesame Street. what was that like? I mean, that's got to be the allstar for a puppeteer, ventril. yeah, I never imagined that I would get to Sesame Street. I grew up watching it as a child and I even had a Sesame Street theme birthday party when I was 3 years old, and so I submitted an application to the Jim Henson company in 201- 17. I wasn't expecting to hear back, but in 2020, um- The Producers had time to go through old submissions from the Jim Henson company and one of the producers, Matt Fogle, saw my application and reached out and asked if I would be interested in working with Sesame Street. so I trained um and I learned Muppet style puppetry and joined the cast in 2021. is it a pretty small community of people who do what you do? oh, it's a super SM Community. you think so, J? yeah, it is, but it's a. it's a very supportive community. so, as, immediately after I joined Sesame Street, I was surrounded by the greats who are willing to, to teach me and to learn, and so, also to answer your question. I practice by learning from others, and you just released a new children's album. tell me about that. uh, Mr Lester, I have a question. sure, do you have any snacks, do we have? oh, my goodness, we don't have any snacks. our snack person is off today. June bug, I can get you snacks. okay, why don't you take a break? okay, I'll be back. I'm sorry she didn't feed me before we got here. oh, that's okay. yeah, we'll get you some snacks. I'm sorry, Lester. okay, I should feed him next time. so, so, tell me about this album. so I released a children's music album, um last year. so, uh, Beyond being a puppeteer, I'm a Creator, and so I love creating stories and songs. so I released an album co-produced with uh, Bootsy Collins and Sir the Baptist, and we brought the music to life with puppets. that's true, and the puppet sing as well. that's right, June bug. he's on a song called make you proud, and you obviously have a wonderful singing voice. oh, thank you. yeah, I enjoy singing. so we'll be um doing more music this year. and Jun bug and I are working on an album with um, the Soul Children of Chicago, um, right now, a choir that's been around for over 40 years? sure, yeah, I used to live in Chicago. I remember them and, uh, this is obviously a very important project for you. that's right. it's very important to me to use music and puppets to inspire kids to pursue their wildest and most unique dreams. I'm a fulltime Puppeteer and I know, as I said when you came in here, kids very excited. we got a lot of response to you being here today. we've got one more question, if you will. yeah, here it is. hi, my name is Jon, from Michigan, and my question is: what would you say to black girls like me who are trying to get into, like puppeteering or or getting into the Arts? terrific question. well, first, I'm excited that you're interested in puppetry. it took me many years to find my path. I I knew I always love puppetry, but I found first what made me come alive. and what made me come alive was telling stories and singing songs, and I used puppetry as a mode to do that. but I also tried working, as I was an ad sales intern here at NBC. yes, I, I, I worked in. I worked in public relations, I um worked in dance and musical theater. I did lots of different jobs in the Arts until I found what really made me come alive and what I wanted to do, and I learned that that was: um, making children laugh and smile, um, by doing puppetry. every time, every time, I've been around a puppeteer or ventriloquist- when they walk in the room with a puppet, people smile right away. it's, it's this ultimate, you know, social moment of you know, breaking any tension in the room. what's that like to have that ability? it's like Awakening someone's imagination. it doesn't matter if you're 2 years old or 80 years old. there's a part in your mind that wants to believe that something that doesn't exist right now can happen, and that's the. the Essence of Hope is believing in something can happen that doesn't exist right now, and so when I bring Junebug to life, I'm bringing something inanimate to life, and so it immediately makes, I think, the soul and the heart smile and laugh to see something that's not real. well, you two have certainly brightened our day here at Nightly News Kids edition. Megan, great to have you on. thanks so much. I hope to see you again. yes, thanks, Lester and June bud, I'm still down here. well, so much fun. that's going to do it for us parents. just a reminder: if your child has a question about any Topic in the news. email a video to us at Nightly News kids, nbcunicom. you can also follow us on Instagram at nightly kids. and, just to program note, you can catch a new episode of Nightly News Kids edition every Thursday on nbcnewscom and YouTube and streaming on the weekends on NBC news. now, thanks for watching everyone. remember to take care of yourself and each other. have a great [Music] weekend.",[207]

SO WE WILL SEE WHICH AVENUES RISE TO THE TOP ELECTION DAY IN NOVEMBER, AS THIS WILL BE AN ISSUE, A BIG ISSUE FOR A LOT OF VOTERS MAKING THE DECISION TODAY ON WHO WILL BE PRESIDENT NEXT YEAR, JOE >>>. BOTH PRESIDENT BIDEN AND FORMER, PRESIDENT TRUMP ARE FACING SOME PRETTY STRONG HEADWINDS. WHEN IT COMES TO WINNING OVER, BLACK VOTERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. NBC NEWS SPOKE WITH A FOCUS GROUP OF BLACK VOTERS. THE WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT EXPLAINS WHY, WHEN IT COMES TO THIS YEAR'S LIKELY CHOICES, MANY VOTERS CAN BE DESCRIBED AS DOUBLEHEADERS. >>. Reporter. THE MAJOR WARNING FOR BOTH BIDEN AND TRUMP FROM A DEMOGRAPHIC THAT MAY PROVE CRITICAL IN THE 2024 ELECTION: BLACK VOTERS, A NEW FOCUS GROUP IN NORTH CAROLINA TELLING NBC NEWS. MANY OF THEM WILL NOT VOTE FOR TRUMP BUT THEY ARE NOT THRILLED ABOUT EITHER A POLITICAL PHENOMENON KNOWN AS DOUBLEHEADERS >> THE FIRST THING THAT COMES TO MIND, PRESIDENT BIDEN >> AND CONFIDENT >> I LOOK AT HIM AS KIND OF SMUG AND ENTITLED. >>. Reporter. WHAT IS THE FIRST THING THAT COMES TO MIND WHEN YOU THINK OF DONALD TRUMP? >> THE FOCUS GROUP, COLLABORATION FINDING THAT DESPITE THE BLACK COMMUNITIES, HISTORIC SUPPORT FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN. THESE, FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN, THESE VOTERS HAVE MAJOR RESERVATIONS. THE PANELISTS AT TIMES STRUGGLING TO NAME ANYTHING PRESIDENT BIDEN HAD DONE FOR THE BLACK COMMUNITY. >> WHAT ARE YOU DOING FOR THE BLACK STUDENTS, AND NOT JUST HBCU? >>. Reporter. THE GROUP PENNED HIS EFFORTS TO BROADCAST HIS ACCOMPLISHMENTS. >> I THINK IT IS ALL POLITICAL MUMBO-JUMBO. >>. Reporter. DESPITE THE HARSH WORDS TO PRESIDENT BIDEN MOST SAID THEY WOULD VOTE FOR HIM. SAID THEY WOULD VOTE FOR HIM. THE GROUP LEFT THE MOST BITING CRITICISM TO PRESIDENT TRUMP, ESPECIALLY OVER HIS RECENT REMARKS ABOUT THE BLACK IMMUNITY. >>. I GOT INDICTED FOR A SECOND TIME AND A THIRD TIME AND A FOURTH TIME AND A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID THAT IS BECAUSE THE BLACK PEOPLE HAVE BEEN HURT SO BADLY AND DISCRIMINATED AGAINST >>. IT FEELS LIKE HE THINKS WE ARE ALL CRIMINALS. >>. ARE YOU SERIOUS? THAT IS WHAT YOU THINK OF US. >> WHAT DO ALL OF YOU MAKE OF THE BACKERS OF TRUMP TO SAY TRUMP APPEALS TO BLACK VOTERS? >>. IT IS LIKE A JOKE. >> IT IS LIKE A JOKE. HE DOES NOT TAKE US SERIOUSLY. >>. Reporter. HE PULLED AHEAD OF TRUMP BY NEARLY 60% IN JANUARY'S NBC NEWS POLL BUT COMPARED TO WHERE THOSE NUMBERS SET IN 2020, HE IS HOLD ON. THE BLACK VOTE IS STARTING TO SLIP. NORTH CAROLINA IS IN PLACE FOR 2024 AND COULD BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REELECTION AND THE HISTORIC PRESIDENT. NOW THE RISE OF DOUBLEHEADERS RAISING THE CRITICAL QUESTION: WILL THE BLACK VOTERS SHOW UP FOR HIM ONE MORE TIME IN THIS IMPORTANT ELECTION OF HIS LIFE? >>> VOTERS IN NORTH CAROLINA WILL HEAD TO THE POLLS NEXT WEEK TO VOTE FOR THAT PRIMARY ONE OF MANY TAKEN PLACE ON SUPER TUESDAY. WE WILL HAVE FULL COVERAGE OF SUPER TUESDAY RIGHT HERE ON NBC NEWS NOW, 5:00 PM, EASTERN. >>>. FROM THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL'S OF THE COURTROOM AND THE CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS OF MR TRUMP IN FLORIDA. TODAY THAT JUDGE WILL HEAR ARGUMENTS FROM BOTH SPECIAL COUNSEL JACK SMITH AND TRUMP'S LEGAL TEAM WHEN THAT TRIAL SHOULD START. THE TRIAL WAS SET FOR MAY BUT NEEDS TO BE MOVED BECAUSE OF ALL OF THE OTHER CASES. SMITH IS SUGGESTING A JULY DATE. BUT THE FILING FROM TRAINING -- BUT THE FILING FROM TRAINING -- TEAMS -- TERMS. TEAM SAYS AFTER THE ELECTION. THE JUSTICES WILL HEAR ARGUMENTS ABOUT THAT IN APRIL. TRUMP IS ACCUSED OF MISHANDLING CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS AND HAS DENIED ANY WRONGDOING EXTRACT. THE REPUBLICAN-LED HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE HAS RELEASED THE FULL TRANSCRIPT OF HUNTER BIDEN IS CLOSED DOOR TESTIMONY- THE PRESIDENTS SON TESTIFIED ON WEDNESDAY. IT WAS PART OF THE GOP IMPEACHMENT QUERY INTO HIS FATHER, PRESIDENT BIDEN, ALLEGING THE PRESIDENT WAS INVOLVED IN SOME OF HIS BUSINESS BUILDING -- DEALINGS. SARA FITZPATRICK JOINS US. THE TRANSCRIPT OF THIS TESTIMONY IS MORE THAN 200 PAGES LONG, WITH SOME REDACTION. IN YOUR REPORTING YOU SAY IT UNDERSCORES THE DISCONNECT BETWEEN WHAT HOUSE REPUBLICANS ALLEGE ARE CRIMINAL ACTIONS BY HUNTER BIDEN AND HIS FATHER AND THE TESTIMONY THAT THEY MADE PUBLIC. SO BREAKDOWN WHAT WE ARE LEARNING ABOUT THIS TRANSCRIPT >>. THE TRANSCRIPT IS A FASCINATING DOCUMENT. THE FIRST- THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE'RE ABLE TO SEE ALL OF THE EVIDENCE THAT REPUBLICANS HAVE GATHERED BANK RECORDS, MEMOS, MESSAGES, EMAILS, AND SEE THEM LAID OUT IN MANY CASES. IN ALL CASES, IT APPEARS THAT THE CONCLUSIONS THEY WERE MAKING IN SOME OF THOSE DOCUMENTS WHEN -- WERE EITHER INACCURATE OR MISCHARACTERIZED BUT OVERALL, TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT, AND SO I THINK, OF COURSE IT IS POSSIBLE. THERE IS MORE EVIDENCE TO COME, BUT IT SEEMS UNLIKELY GIVEN THAT REPUBLICANS HAVE TALKED ABOUT HUNTER'S MONEY AS A CRESCENDO IN THIS INVESTIGATION AND HAVE NOT INDICATED WHAT ELSE IS COMING. SECONDLY, I THINK WHAT WE SAW WAS REAL CONFIDENCE OF HUNTER BIDEN. HE WAS VERY AGGRESSIVE IN PUSHING BACK. HE WAS EMPHATIC ABOUT THE FACT THAT HIS FATHER, ABOUT THE FACT THAT HIS FATHER HAD NO -- AT NO POINT- HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH HIS BUSINESS DEALINGS. THERE IS ONE EMAIL THAT HAS POINTED TO REPUBLICANS IN WHICH HUNTER SAID THAT HIS FATHER WAS IN THE ROOM WITH HIM. HUNTER TESTIFIED THAT THAT WAS NOT THE CASE AND BELIEVED HE WAS VERY HIGH IN HIS ADDICTION AT THAT POINT AND NOT SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY OCCURRED. >> WHAT ARE WE HEARING FROM THE CHAIR OF THE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE >>. THE CHAIRMAN AND OTHER HOUSE REPUBLICANS ARE STANDING. FIRM CONGRESS TOLD US LAST NIGHT THAT HUNTRESS TESTIMONY SHOWS THERE WAS EVIDENCE OF SOME OF THE THINGS THEY HAVE BEEN CLAIMING AND THAT THERE WERE INCONSISTENCIES IN HUNTRESS STATEMENTS. I THINK HE SAID THAT THE COMMITTEE IS STILL MOVING FORWARD WITH PLANS TO HOLD THE PUBLIC HEARING. ALTHOUGH WE ARE HEARING FROM REPUBLICANS THAT THEY MAY NOT FULLY SUPPORT THA. IF THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS, WE WILL HAVE TO SEE WHAT THAT ENTAILS AND IF THEY HAVE THE SUPPORT TO MAKE THAT WORK FOR OUT -- WORTHWHILE. >>>. IN TEXAS THE DEADLY WILDFIRE THAT HAS RAVAGED MORE THAN 1 MILLION ACRES IS NOW THE SECOND LARGEST IN UNITED STATES HISTORY. IT IS KNOWN AS THE SMOKEHOUSE CREEK FIRE, THE BIGGEST IN TEXAS HISTORY. THE WILDFIRES HAVE KILLED AT LEAST TWO PEOPLE AND ARE NOW MOVING EAST. MORGAN CHESKY IS IN CANADIAN TEXAS WITH THE LATEST >>. Reporter. A TOUGH WARNING FOR SO MANY IN THE TEXAS PANHANDLE AND IN CANADIAN. THE FLAMES MAY BE OUT, BUT THAT LINGERING SMELL OF SMOKE MARKS SO MUCH LOSS FOR SO MANY IN. SO MUCH LOSS FOR SO MANY IN THIS TEXAS TOWN. THE SMOKEHOUSE CREEK FIRE IS NOW THE LARGEST IN STATE HISTORY. AUTHORITIES SAY IT HAS BURNED 1.1 MILLION ACRES AND IS JUST 3% CONTAINED. THERE ARE OTHER FIRES BURNING ACROSS THE TEXAS PANHANDLE AND THE CONCERN HERE. WHILE WE HAD A BIT OF A BREAK FROM THE WEATHER YESTERDAY EVEN, A SNOWSTORM IN SOME PARTS OF THE STATE. WINDS ARE PICKING BACK UP, AND SO ARE THE TEMPERATURES, AND IT JUST TAKES ONE SPARK TO REIGNITE. AS FOR THE CURRENT DEATH TOLL, AUTHORITIES SAY IT STANDS AT TWO. IN ONE INSTANCE, AN 83-YEAR-OLD WOMAN WAS KILLED WHEN THE FIRE OVERTOOK HER HOME OVER THE LAST 24 HOURS. AUTHORITIES SAY ANOTHER DEATH TOOK PLACE WHEN A WOMAN WAS DRIVING ACROSS THE PANHANDLE AND MEETING A FAST MOVING FIRE THAT OVERTOOK HER TRUCK. AUTHORITIES SAY IT IS IMPERATIVE FOR PEOPLE IN THESE COMMUNITIES TO BE ABSOLUTELY AWARE OF WHERE THE LATEST FRONTS ARE ON THESE MULTIPLE BLAZES. PRESIDENT BIDEN SAYING OVER THE LAST 24 HOURS THAT HE IS DISPATCHING 500 FEDERAL PERSONNEL TO ASSIST IN THIS ONGOING FIGHT, AND THAT INCLUDES 100 FIREFIGHTERS, WHICH WILL NO DOUBT BE WELCOMED BY THE RESOURCES. HERE IN TEXAS, MANY OF THE FIRE DEPARTMENTS ARE VOLUNTEERING AND STRETCHED VERY THIN BECAUSE OF THE VAST EXPANSE THAT THIS WILDFIRE FIGHT COVERS. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT AN AREA THAT IS LARGER THAN FROM NEW YORK TO PHILADELPHIA, AND THAT IS JUST ONE OF THE FOUR FIRES BURNING TODAY. AUTHORITIES SAY THAT, AS THE HUMIDITY DROPS AND THE TEMPERATURE GOES BACK UP. PEOPLE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS FIREFIGHT CAN CHANGE DRASTICALLY RIGHT. NOW. THERE IS NO ONE BREATHING EASY HERE AND THIS PART OF TEXAS ESPECIALLY, WITH THAT WARM WEEKEND FORECAST ON THE WAY. >>> ON THE WEST COAST, A VERY DIFFERENT STORY: MILLIONS WAKING UP TO WINTER ALERTS. WE WILL CHECK IN WITH MICHELLE GROSSMAN. >>. WE ARE TALKING A LOT OF SNOW. WE COULD SEE UP TO 10 FEET OF SNOW IN THE HIGHEST ELEVATION OF THE SIERRAS WHITE OUT CONDITIONS WITH WINDS GUSTING UP TO 55, 60 MILES AN HOUR ALONG THE COAST- REALLY HEAVY RAIN. WE ARE SEEING THE SNOW FALLING AND RAIN FALLING YELLOWS AND REDS. WE ARE SEEING SOME HEAVY RAIN FALLING AND WE WILL SEE UPWARDS OF 10 INCHES OF RAIN ALONG THE COAST. IN TERMS OF THAT RAINFALL, 7 MILLION PEOPLE WAKING UP TO WINTER ALERTS ALSO. SO WINTER STORM WATCH IS NOT ONLY TODAY BUT FOR THE WEEKEND. TODAY WE ARE LOOKING AT THAT EXTREMELY HEAVY SNOW. WE WILL LOOK AT THE WINDS BLASTING AND THAT COULD BRING DOWN SOME POWER LINES. IT IS REALLY COLD IN THE WEST. WE ARE LOOKING AT THE WHITE OUT CONDITIONS AND POSSIBLE TRAVEL BECAUSE OF THAT SNOW FALLING ONE OR TWO INCHES PER HOUR IN ADDITION TO THE WIND REALLY BLOWING AT TIMES, SNOWFALL RATES UP TO 2 TO 4 INCHES PER HOUR AND THAT WILL CONTINUE TO POUR DOWN AND WE WILL GET HEAVY ROUNDS OF RAIN FOR THE COASTAL AREA. WE BEGIN TO TAPER OFF THAT SNOW TO THE SIERRA MOUNTAINS, THAT SNOW LIKELY IN THE CENTRAL ROCKIES. BY SUNDAY THE SNOWFALL FORECAST 5 TO 10 FEET ABOVE 5000 FEET AND LOCALLY HIGHER AMOUNTS AS WE GO A LITTLE BIT HIGHER INTO THE HIGHEST ELEVATIONS OF THE MOUNTAIN. IN TERMS OF THAT RAINFALL, THIS WILL CREATE A MESS. FIVE TO 10 INCHES ALONG THE COAST OF THE CAROLINAS- NOTICE THE BRIGHTER COLORS, DARKER COLORS, WHERE WE ARE EXPECTING HEAVY RAINFALL, ESPECIALLY ALONG THE CAROLINA COAST, INTO THE GULF STATES AS WELL TO THE SOUTHEAST, UP INTO PORTIONS OF THE MID-ATLANTIC BY OVERNIGHT, TONIGHT, THE SOAKER TODAY IN THE SOUTHEAST, A BIT OF WINTRY WEATHER FOR THE APPALACHIANS AS WE GO THROUGHOUT. TOMORROW IT IS GOING TO BE A WET START TO THE WEEKEND, LOOKING TO BE A NICE END TO THE WEEKEND. >>. I AM MAKING INDOOR PLANTS. >>. I AM MAKING INDOOR PLANTS FOR THE WEEKEND >>>. INTERNATIONAL OUTRAGE GROWING AFTER AN INCIDENT THAT LEFT AT LEAST 100 PEOPLE DEAD AND 100 MORE -- HUNDREDS MORE- INJURED WHILE THEY WERE WAITING FOR FOOD IN GAZA CITY. NBC NEWS HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO INDEPENDENTLY VERIFY THAT DEATH TOLL, AND IT IS UNCLEAR HOW MANY PEOPLE DIED FROM THE STAMPEDE OR THE GUNFIRE THAT FOLLOWED. THE UNITED NATIONS ARE CONDEMNING THE INCIDENT, SAYING THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DELIVER AID TO THE REGION IN MORE THAN A WEEK. GAZA IS ON THE BRINK OF A FAMINE, PROMPTING SOME NATIONS TO CONSIDER AIRDROPPING AID TO HELP GAZA ON THE GROUND. THE WHITE HOUSE IS PUSHING FOR. THE WHITE HOUSE IS PUSHING FOR AID IN THE HOSTAGE SITUATION. >>> MOLLY HUNTER JOINED US FROM. >>> MOLLY HUNTER JOINED US FROM LONDON WITH THE LATEST. WHAT ARE WE LEARNING ABOUT THIS INCIDENT? >>. Reporter. I THINK YOU LAID IT OUT REALLY WELL, AND WHAT SHOULD NOT BE LOST IS HOW DESPERATE THE PEOPLE ARE IN THIS AREA IN NORTHERN GAZA, WHICH IS WHY THERE WERE SUCH HUGE CROWDS. MORE THAN 100 PEOPLE WERE KILLED, NEARLY 800 WERE INJURED. WHEN HUGE CROWDS WERE GATHERED AND WAITING FOR WHEN ISRAELI TROOPS OPENED FIRE. ONE PALESTINIAN EYEWITNESS TELLS NBC NEWS REPORTING SPECIFICALLY TO OUR TEAM SAYING: ISRAELI TROOPS OPENED FIRE ON THE CROWDS BEFORE THE TRUCKS ARRIVED. THERE ARE LIMITED HOSPITALS, LIMITED FACILITIES FOR GUNSHOT WOUNDS. THE ISRAELI MILITARY SAID THERE WAS CHAOS AND STAMPEDE, AND MOST OF THE INJURIES HAPPENED IN THAT ISRAELI TROOPS FIRED WARNING SHOTS. AND THEY ALSO SAY THERE WERE TWO INCIDENTS THAT WERE SEPARATE. TAKE A LISTEN TO WHAT THE STATE DEPARTMENT PERSON, MATT MILLER, HAD TO SAY: >> WHEN IT COMES TO ESTABLISHING FACTS ON THE GROUND, WE ARE SEEKING INFORMATION ON WHAT EXACTLY SHOULD PLACE. WE HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT AND UNDERSTAND THAT AN INVESTIGATION IS UNDERWAY. WE WILL BE MONITORING THAT CLOSELY AND PRESSING FOR ANSWERS. >>. I THINK WHAT SHOULD NOT BE LOST. WE HAVE SEEN VIDEOS OF HUGE CROWDS CROWDING AROUND THESE TRUCKS. TRUCKS HAVE REALLY BEEN ABLE TO GET INTO NORTHERN GAZA AND THEY ARE UNDERSCORING THE SERIOUS DESPERATION. >>. SEVERAL NATIONS ARE CONSIDERING AIRDROPPING AID INTO GAZA. WALK US THROUGH. HOW DIRE THE SITUATION IS, AND IS THAT SOMETHING THE UNITED STATES WOULD ALSO CONSIDER? >>. IT IS PRETTY EXTRAORDINARY. BECAUSE OF THE LAND CROSSINGS AND BECAUSE OF THE TRUCK, THEY ARE HAVING SUCH A HARD TIME GETTING TO THE PEOPLE WHO NEED THIS AID. MOST JORDAN RESORTING TO AIRDROP. SOME ARE SUCCESSFUL. SOME ARE MISSING THEIR TARGETS BUT US OFFICIALS HAVE TOLD NBC NEWS THAT THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION IS CONSIDERING AIRDROPS. THIS COMES AS KIND OF THE LOOMING FAMINE THAT IS ARRIVING. THE UN NOW WARNS THAT A QUARTER OF THE POPULATION, JUST OVER 500,000 PEOPLE, ARE >>. Reporter. ONE STEP AWAY FROM FAMINE, YOU CAN SEE HOW DESPERATE PEOPLE ARE FOR FLOWER, ANYTHING THEY CAN FEED THEIR FAMILIES. >>. HOVERING OVER ALL OF THIS IS NEGOTIATIONS. TO TRY TO DISCUSS THE FUTURE OF NEGOTIATIONS WITH HAMAS, THE PRESIDENT SEEMED CONFIDENT EARLIER THIS WEEK. HOW DO THINGS LOOK NOW? >>. Reporter. WE HEARD THE PRESIDENT WHILE HE WAS EATING ICE CREAM THAT HE HOPES THAT WOULD BE A DEAL BY MONDAY. HE IS WALKING THAT BACK SAYING THAT IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THERE WILL BE A DEAL AS EARLY AS MONDAY. BUT WE ACTUALLY HAVE A READOUT FROM THE WHITE HOUSE OF HIS CALLED WITH THE MINISTER. HE TALKS ABOUT, OBVIOUSLY, THE TRAGIC AND ALARMING INCIDENT YESTERDAY, THE LOSS OF CIVILIAN LIVES, AND UNDERSCORE THE URGENCY OF BRINGING NEGOTIATIONS TO A CLOSE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND EXPANDING THE FLOW OF HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE INTO GAZA. CLEARLY, THERE ARE A COUPLE OF THINGS. NOT ONLY DOES THE INCIDENT ERODE TRUST. THAT COMPLICATES NEGOTIATIONS, IF YOU LISTEN TO THE WHITE HOUSE AND LOOK AT THE READOUT, BUT IT ALSO UNDERSCORES THE NEED, A REAL, DESPERATE NEED- FOR A DEAL THAT NOT ONLY RELEASES HOSTAGES AND CALLS FOR A CEASE-FIRE BUT ALSO GETS MUCH-NEEDED AID INTO THE PEOPLE WHO NEED IT, THE MOST. >>>. MUCH MORE TO COME ON MORNING NEWS LATER THIS HOUR. FERTILITY FALLOUT. LAWMAKERS IN ALABAMA ARE WORKING TO PROTECT IVF TREATMENTS, FOLLOWING THAT CONTROVERSIAL EMBRYO RULING >>> RUSSIA DIVIDED >>> RUSSIA DIVIDED >>>. NEWS FOR THE GENERATION OF NOW IS NBC NEWS NOW. >>> A FUNERAL SERVICE FOR ALEXEI NAVALNY TAKING PLACE IN MOSCOW. ALEXEI NAVALNY DIED TWO WEEKS AGO, AFTER YEARS OF BEING PRESIDENT PUTIN'S HIGHEST PROFILE. CRITIC ALLIES ACCUSE PUTIN OF HAVING A HAND IN HIS DEATH. WE KNOW THE SERVICE STARTED EARLIER. WALK US THROUGH WHAT WE HAVE SEEN SO FAR AND WHAT IS EXPECTED >>. Reporter. I THINK IT HAS BEEN A PRETTY INTERESTING MORNING. SO FAR, THE POLICE HAVE BEEN EXPECTING A FUNERAL FOR A FEW DAYS AND HAVE MADE PREPARATIONS BARRICADING THE CHURCH AND THE CEMETERY AND THE PROCESSION PATH BETWEEN THESE TWO PLACES. I THINK WE HAVE SEEN ABOUT 1000 PEOPLE SHOW UP, BUT YOU CAN DEFINITELY SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GATHERED, OR HAVE BEEN GATHERED, OUTSIDE OF THE CHURCH. THIS MORNING, ALEXEI NAVALNY'S BODY- THE WAS CONCERNED THAT AUTHORITIES WERE CONTINUING TO DISRUPT THIS ENTIRE EVENT. TODAY, WITH THE SPOKESPERSON, THEY WERE NOT HANDED THE BODY ON TIME, AS ANTICIPATED, THE BODY IS HEADING OVER TO THE CHURCH. THIS HAS, I THINK, BEEN ALLOWED SO FAR TO MORE OR LESS GO UNHINDERED, WITH EVERYTHING ON THE STREETS GOING ON, GOING ON RIGHT. NOW, ALEXEI NAVALNY'S BODY IS MOVING FROM THE CHURCH TO THE CEMETERY AND, AS I MENTIONED, THERE ARE POLICE ALONG THIS PROCESSION ROUTE. IT IS NOT OVER YET >>. YOU TALK ABOUT PEOPLE SHOWING UP. DESPITE EVERY REASON NOT TO TALK ABOUT THAT AND THE REACTION WE ARE HEARING FROM RUSSIA AND THE ALEXEI NAVALNY SUPPORTERS AND FROM THE KREMLIN >>. THE KREMLIN SENDING DISRESPECTFUL MESSAGES TO THE FAMILY AND SUPPORTERS AND I THINK THE CLEAR MESSAGE THAT ANY FORM WILL NOT BE TOLERATED. WE SAW INDIVIDUALS POPPING UP AFTER ALEXEI NAVALNY'S DEATH WAS ANNOUNCED AND THESE WERE DEALT WITH BY THE RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES. SO THEY WERE VERY CLEARLY TELEGRAPHING HOW THEY MIGHT STILL RESPOND THIS MORNING. UNSANCTIONED GATHERINGS ARE ILLEGAL, ACCORDING TO RUSSIAN LAW. THERE ARE PENALTIES THAT EVERYONE ATTENDING THIS FUNERAL TODAY ARE MORE OR LESS EXPOSING THEMSELVES TO. THEY DO HAVE THE LEGAL OPTION OF TAKING THEM UP TO 15 YEARS IN PRISON. THESE ARE TOOLS THAT THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT HAS TO DEAL WITH IT. HOWEVER THEY DECIDE TO DEAL WITH IT, AT THE END OF THE DAY THERE WILL BE SOME RESIDUAL MOVEMENT LATER IN THE DAY. I THINK THE MAIN MESSAGE IS THAT EVERYONE HERE IS SUPPORTING AN OPPOSITION LEADER WHO APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN MURDERED BY THE GOVERNMENT. HIS WIFE IS NOT ATTENDING THE FUNERAL AND VERY FEW PEOPLE ARE LEFT OUTSIDE OF THE JAIL. A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HOPEFUL UNTIL RECENTLY. THE ELECTION IS COMING UP IN TWO WEEKS. THIS HAS BEEN INTERESTING ON WHERE EVERYTHING IS AT IN RUSSIA. RIGHT NOW, PAICULARLY, THE OPPOSITION >>. YOU MENTIONED THE ELECTION COMING UP. IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION TO VLADIMIR PUTIN? RIGHT NOW, HE OBVIOUSLY EXPECTS TO WIN THE ELECTION >>. IT IS ENGINEERED. THERE IS NO GENUINE CANDIDATE ON THE BALLOT THAT WE ARE AWARE OF. INSTEAD, WE ARE SEEING THE USUAL SUSPECTS: A PHONY OPPOSITION CANDIDATE ON THE COMMUNIST PARTY, ONE FROM A COMMUNIST PARTY, ONE FROM A NATIONALIST PARTY >>>. HERE IN THE STATES ALABAMA, LAWMAKERS ARE ONE STEP CLOSER TO SAFEGUARDING IVF PROCEDURES. BUT QUESTIONS REMAIN. BOTH CHAMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE PASSED REPUBLICAN BACKED BILLS YESTERDAY THAT ARE PROTECTED TO -- DESIGNED TO PROTECT- EMBRYOS ARE CONSIDERED CHILDREN, FORCING SEVERAL IVF PROVIDERS TO BRING TREATMENTS TO A HALT. AND THE HOUSE AND SENATE WILL VOTE ON A UNIFIED VERSION OF THIS BILL BEFORE SENDING IT TO BE SIGNED. LAWMAKERS HAVE SAID THIS IS A QUICK FIX AND THE GOAL IS TO TRY TO GET SERVICES BACK RIGHT AWAY. IS THIS LEGISLATION GOING TO DO THE TRICK TO MAKE SURE PROVIDERS ARE SAFE, PATIENTS ARE SAVED AND THEY WON'T BE PROSECUTED? >>. THIS IS WHAT THIS PROPOSED LEGISLATION ACTUALLY DOES, AND IT IS CALLED A QUICK FIX BECAUSE IT CREATES IMMUNITY AND LIMITED IMMUNITY FOR THE SERVICE PROVIDERS. IT DOESN'T GO TO THE ISSUE OF SAME. THE ALABAMA SUPREME COURT GOT IT WRONG. WE ARE GOING TO TREAT THESE. WE ARE GOING TO TREAT THESE EMBRYOS AS NON-PEOPLE UNDER THE LAW, UNDER ALABAMA LAW, WHICH IS HUNDREDS OF YEARS OLD, PROJECTING EMBRYOS NOW OUTSIDE OF THE WOMB. IT CREATES A NARROW CARVEOUT OF IMMUNITY FOR THESE PROVIDERS, WHICH I THINK IS A GOOD STRATEGIC MOVE FOR REPUBLICANS, BECAUSE THEY CAN CONTINUE TO ARGUE THAT THE RULING WAS CORRECT BUT ALSO CONTINUE TO PROMOTE IVF FERTILIZATION AND NOT PUNISH THOSE PROVIDERS BUT STILL PAVE THE WAY FOR THE NOTION THAT AN EMBRYO FERTILIZED, EXISTING OUTSIDE THE ROOM AS A PERSON >>. THE ALABAMA SUPREME COURT RULING IS STILL THERE. COULD WE SEE MORE LAWSUITS ABOUT THIS? >>. Reporter. EVER SINCE THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO AN ABORTION WAS ERASED BY THE SUPREME COURT, STATES ARE FREE TO DO WHATEVER THEY LIKE. THEY CAN ALLOW ABORTIONS RIGHT OF TWO -- UP TO THE MOMENT OF BIRTH. IT REALLY IS A FUNCTION OF WHOEVER IS IN CONTROL OF THAT STATE LEGISLATOR. THEY COULD HAVE RUSHED TO SAY SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT THAT THE ALABAMA SUPREME COURT GOT THIS DECISION WRONG, WHICH THEY COULD HAVE DONE INSTEAD BY DOING THIS LIMITED IMMUNITY SAYING IVF PROVIDERS, YOU GUYS CAN KEEP DOING YOUR JOB, BUT THE ALABAMA SUPREME COURT RULING? NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT. IT WILL EXIST >>. DOES ANY OF THIS LEGISLATION IMPACT THE CASE THAT PROMPTED THE SUPREME COURT RULING >>. Reporter. THAT CASE HAS ALREADY BEEN DECIDED. THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A RETRO ACT TO FIX AND READ TO YOU, BUT HE IS AN IMPORTANT CONCEPT IN THE LAW. PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED OR MAYBE WRONGFULLY CONVICTED, IS A GOOD EXAMPLE BEFORE THE LAW WAS PASSED. RETROACTIVITY IS A KEY QUESTION. WILL THIS APPLY BACKWARDS IN TIME? IT APPEARS THAT THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION WILL DO SO, BUT THE CARVEOUT, THE IMMUNITY PROVIDED IS REALLY QUITE NARROW. IT IS JUST FOR THESE PROVIDERS AND THE LEGISLATION IS SAYING: THESE EMBRYOS ARE STILL PEOPLE AND THEY ARE STILL TO BE TREATED AS LIVING PERSONS. HOWEVER THE IVF FACILITIES, WE ARE GOING TO CUT YOU A BREAK AND WE WILL MAKE YOU IMMUNE. EVEN THOUGH THE LAW BELIEVES, THESE ARE PEOPLE LIVING OUTSIDE THE WOMB >>> COMING UP, IT IS MORE AFFORDABLE, BUT IS IT SAFE? DOCTORS ARE SIGNING THE ALARM -- SOUNDING THE ALARM ABOUT. I APOLOGIZE FOR THE MANY QUESTIONS >>. MY COMMITMENT TO HALLIE JACKSON NOW WILL NEVER BE QUESTIONED >>>. WEIGHT LOSS DRUGS HAVE BECOME VERY POPULAR, OFFERING HOPES -- HOPE TO THOSE STRUGGLING WITH OBESITY BUT THEY ARE VERY EXPENSIVE, AND HIGH PRICES ARE CAUSING PEOPLE TO FIND CHEAPER VERSIONS, KNOWN AS COMPOUND VERSIONS. THE QUESTION NOW IS. ARE THOSE FAKE? >>. Reporter. THE NEW JERSEY HAIRSTYLIST, MAINTAINING A HEALTHY WEIGHT WAS NEVER AN ISSUE, UNTIL SHE HAD A CHILD. >> I HAD MY SON, AND WE ALL KNOW. AFTER 30, THINGS START TO CHANGE. >>. Reporter. SHE WANTED TO TRY OZEMPIC, WHICH IS ALSO SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE AND POPULAR FOR WEIGHT LOSS. >> THE REALITY IS $800 A MONTH- NOT SOMETHING SUSTAINABLE FOR ME. >>. Reporter. WHEN THERE IS A NATIONWIDE SHORTAGE OF A DRUG, FDA RULES ALLOW FOR WHAT IS KNOWN AS COMPOUNDING- THE ART OF MIXING AND COMPOUNDING MEDICATIONS. SHE WAS ABLE TO GET HER HANDS ON COMPOUNDED SEMAGLUTIDE- $300 A VIAL- AN ONLINE SITE. SHE LOADS THE SYRINGE HERSELF. >> I WAS TOLD TO SANITIZE THE TOP OF IT EACH TIME. >>. Reporter. ROBIN IS A PROFESSOR AT THE UCONN SCHOOL OF PHARMACY AND TEACHES PROPER COMPOUNDING TECHNIQUES. >> WHEN THERE IS A NEED AND THERE IS A PROPHET, PEOPLE WILL GET INVOLVED IN COMPOUNDING. >>. Reporter. DOZENS OF PHARMACIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE MIXING THEIR OWN VERSIONS AND WHILE SOME ARE INFECTED BY THE -- AFFECTED BY THE FDA, THE DRUGS ARE NOT. THE AGENCY HAS ISSUED A WARNING THAT SEMAGLUTIDE MAY CARRY MORE RISKS AND NEGATIVE SIDE EFFECTS. >> THE BIG ISSUE WITH OBTAINING COMPOUNDING SEMAGLUTIDE. I DON'T KNOW WHERE THESE MOLECULES ARE COMING FROM. I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY ARE. WHAT ELSE IS BEING ADDED? >>. Reporter. SOCIAL MEDIA SITES LIKE TIKTOK ARE FLOODED WITH PROMOTIONS FOR VARIOUS COMPOUNDED MEDICATIONS. OUR TEAM WANTED TO SEE HOW EASY IT WAS TO GET COMPOUNDED SEMAGLUTIDE. WE TRIED EIGHT DIFFERENT SITES THAT DID NOT REQUIRE BLOODWORK, USING OUR REAL HEALTH INFORMATION WE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN APPROVED, AND ALL BUT TWO SIDES TURNED US DOWN. ONE AFTER A QUICK CONSULT WITH A DOCTOR: >> I AM QUALIFIED, GREAT. >> THIS NAUSEA KIND OF SUCKS >>. Reporter KELLY HAS POSTED HER REACTION ON TIKTOK. >> WHEN YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE NO OTHER OPTIONS, YOU GO FOR IT AND DO IT. >>. Reporter. FOR HER, THE REWARD OUTWEIGHS THE RISKS. NBC NEWS: >>> WE HAVE THE DOCTOR HERE AND THE MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR TO ANSWER SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS. LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT IS LEADING TO THE SHORTAGE OF WEIGHT LOSS DRUGS. I HAD A FRIEND RECENTLY ON A PRESCRIPTION SAYING I CANNOT FIND THE DRUG, SO I CANNOT DO IT ANYMORE. WHAT IS HAPPENING DRIVING PEOPLE TO THESE ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS? >> THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY SEMAGLUTIDE. THE ACTIVE INGREDIENTS ARE NOT THAT EASY TO MAKE. IT TAKES SEVERAL PROCESSES UNDER STRICT GUIDANCE AND THAT IN TURN TURNS OUT TO USE SUPPLIES OF WHICH WE HAVE A SHORTAGE OF. SEMAGLUTIDE IS THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT AND WHAT IS AT STAKE IS THE COMPOUNDING PHARMACIES ARE LEGAL AND WHERE THERE IS A SHORTAGE OF THE DRUG, THAT IS ALSO LEGAL. BUT WHAT IS NOT APPROVED BY THE FDA IS THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT. SEMAGLUTIDE COULD POTENTIALLY BE SUBSTITUTED FOR AN EASIER AND NOT NECESSARILY ACCURATE INGREDIENT CALLED THE SALT SEMAGLUTIDE. AND IF THAT IS CONFUSING TO YOU AND ME, IMAGINE HOW IT IS TO SOMEONE GETTING MARKETED- QUOTE, GENERIC- SEMAGLUTIDE'S WHICH TECHNICALLY DO NOT EXIST >>. THIS IS A LITTLE BIT OF A GRAY AREA YOU MENTIONED. THE FDA WILL ALLOW COMPOUNDING, BUT IT ISN'T NECESSARILY APPROVED. HELP US UNDERSTAND THAT. AND WHAT ARE THE RISKS INVOLVED? >>. FIRST OF ALL, THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF LEGAL PHARMACIES TO HELP WITH DRUG SHORTAGES AND SPECIAL FORMULATIONS. AND USUALLY, WHEN YOU GET THESE DRUGS- WHICH I HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO PEOPLE- IT IS FASCINATING AND DOES A GREAT JOB- THEY USUALLY GIVE YOU SOMETHING THAT COMES IN THE FORM OF A VIAL THAT YOU NEED TO INJECT, AND THERE ARE SEVERAL PRECAUTIONS. I WOULD SAY WIPING THE TOP OF IT IS PROBABLY NOT GOOD ENOUGH. BUT GETTING TO YOUR QUESTION, THE ACTUAL COMPOUNDING PHARMACIES CAN TECHNICALLY DO THIS, BUT THE MANUFACTURER OF OZEMPIC IS NOT NECESSARILY GIVING OUT THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT. THEY ARE TRYING TO USE IT AND MAKE IT THEMSELVES. THESE ARE PHARMACISTS THAT ARE DOING THE BEST THEY CAN BUT IN SOME CASES THE FDA HAS BEEN WARNING PEOPLE UNFORTUNATELY. THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY THE INGREDIENT THAT THE FAA -- FDA- CAN SAY IS ACCURATE AND REPRESENTS SEMAGLUTIDE. YOU DO NOT NECESSARILY KNOW IF WHAT YOU ARE INJECTING OR WHAT YOU HAVE PURCHASED IS SAFE. THERE IS NOTHING THAT YOU CAN LOOK FOR AND THAT IS WHY YOU HAVE TO LOOK FOR RELIABLE SOURCES COMPOUNDING PHARMACIES THAT ARE FAMILIAR TO YOUR DOCTOR, AND IF YOU HAVE A TELEHEALTH PRESCRIPTION, YOU NEED TO ASK AND DRILL DOWN AND SAY WHICH PHARMACY CAN I USE. WHERE WE KNOW THESE INGREDIENTS ARE AUTHENTIC AND THAT YOU HAVE HAD EXPERIENCE WITH, THAT CAN AT LEAST GET YOU STARTED. THE RISK, THE INFECTION FROM NOT USING A STERILE TECH WEEK IS THE INJECTION ITSELF. BUT IF YOU ARE USING THE COMPOUND FOREIGN OF SALT SEMAGLUTIDE, IT MAY NOT RESULT IN WHAT YOU WANT. WEIGHT LOSS CONTROL MIGHT NOT OCCUR AND SOME OF THE SIDE EFFECTS WE TALKED ABOUT COULD POTENTIALLY BE WORSE. >>. THANK YOU SO MUCH. WE APPRECIATE IT. >>>.

HE ALSO CLAIMS THAT THE COFOUNDER ORIGINALLY APPROACHED TO MAKE A NONPROFIT COMPANY TO DEVELOP AI TECHNOLOGY FOR THE BENEFIT OF HUMANITY. NOW AI, WHICH ISBY MICROSOFT, FOCUSES ON MAKING PROFITS AND FOCUSES ON MAKING PROFITS AND BREAKING THAT AGREEMENT. ONE OF THE THINGS HERE IS THAT IT WAS CALLED OPEN AI BECAUSE THEY WANTED THIS TO BE AN OPEN SOURCE, SO LOTS OF PEOPLE COULD SEE WHAT IS GOING ON AND THE USE OF THE TECHNOLOGY. NOW IT IS NOT AN OPEN SOURCE. PEOPLE DON'T KNOW ALL OF THE THINGS IT IS USING TO TRAIN, CHECK AND AI. >>>. NOW TO ITS SCIENCE MYSTERY. >>> NOW TO ITS SCIENCE MYSTERY. THIS IS CHARLOTTE THE STINGRAY. SHE LIVES IN NORTH CAROLINA AND SHE IS GETTING READY TO GIVE BIRTH AT. HERE IS THE KICKER. SHE HAS NOT HAD CONTACT WITH A MALE FOR MORE THAN EIGHT YEARS. SCIENTISTS ACTUALLY THINK THERE IS NO FATHER AND YET STINGRAY BABIES ARE CALLED PUMPS. THE DOCTOR JOINS US TO SHARE SOME LIGHT ON ALL OF THIS. SHE IS A PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF BALTIMORE COUNTY. EXPERTS SAY THE GENESIS WERE, VIRGIN BIRTH, IS THE ONLY LIKELY CAUSE OF CHARLOTTES PREGNANCY EXPLAINED TO US. WHAT IS THAT? >>. GENESIS IS A FORM OF REPRODUCTION, OR ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION. THAT MEANS X BEING PRODUCED BY THE FEMALE IS DEVELOPING ALL ON ITS OWN AND HAS THE COMPLEMENTS IT NEEDS. ALL IT NEEDS IN ORDER TO ALL. IT NEEDS IN ORDER TO DEVELOP INTO A BABY. DEVELOP INTO A BABY. IN THIS CASE IT IS A POP -- PUP THAT SHE IS PRODUCING TWO TO FOUR. >>. IN 2021, A SHARK CONCEIVED SEVERAL KOMODO DRAGONS ALSO GAVE BIRTH WITHOUT A MATE. WHAT IS IT THAT TRIGGERS THIS? >>. IN MANY CASES, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TRIGGERS SPONTANEOUS GENESIS BUT IN SPECIES THAT HAVE REGULAR ASEXUAL REPRODUCTIVE CYCLES, THAT TRIGGER CAN BE STRESS, OVERCROWDING OR CHEMICAL CHANGES IN THE ENVIRONMENT THAT CAUSE ORGANISMS TO SHIFT FROM SEXUAL REPRODUCTION TO ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION >>. SO THIS HAS BEEN OBSERVED IN EVERY CLASS OF ANIMALS, I UNDERSTAND, EXCEPT FOR MAMMALS. WHY DO WE THINK THAT IS? >>. THERE IS A PRETTY CLEAR, CUT REASON WHY MAMMALS CANNOT PRODUCE ASEXUALLY, AND IT IS CALLED GENOMIC PRINTING. WHAT THAT MEANS IS DURING THE WHAT THAT MEANS IS DURING THE EARLY STAGE DEVELOPMENT. THERE NEEDS TO BE CERTAIN DEVELOPMENTAL GENES THAT HAVE TO COME FROM AND AND WITHOUT THOSE DEVELOPMENTAL GENES FUNCTIONING, THE EGG IS GOING TO REST AND IT WON'T DEVELOP ANY FURTHER. GENOMIC IMPRINTING IS THE REASON I KIND OF CONSIDER MAMMALS ALL IN ON SEXUAL REPRODUCTION. THEY ARE PHYSICALLY INCAPABLE OF REPRODUCING IN THE WAY THAT CHARLOTTE APPEARS TO HAVE DONE. >>. WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? DO WE KNOW HOW CARETAKERS WILL DETERMINE HOW SHE CONCEIVED? DETERMINE HOW SHE CONCEIVED THEM? >>. AFTER A COUPLE OF MONTHS, THE PUPS WILL BE BORN ALIVE. AFTER THAT TIME, THEY WILL BE EXAMINED FOR SIGNS OF HEALTH, GENETICS AND OTHERWISE, BASED ON THE SIX OF THOSE OFFSPRING, WHETHER THEY ARE MALE OR FEMALE, AND THE DEVELOPMENTAL TIMING OF THOSE WILL HOPEFULLY BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHAT PART OF THE PARTHENOGENESIS WAS USED TO PRODUCE THOSE. AND IT IS ALSO INTERESTING THAT THEY MAY HAVE A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER CHANCE OF REPRODUCING SPONTANEOUSLY THROUGH PARTS OF THE PARTHENOGENESIS ITSELF. THIS COULD BE INHERITED AND BE PASSED ON TO ANY OFFSPRING SHE HAS. >>. COULD IT HAVE BEEN THE SHARK? >>. NO, IT IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY IT COULD HAVE BEEN ANY OF THE SHARKS THAT CHARLOTTE WAS IN THE TANK WITH THAT FATHERED HER PUP. THE SHARKS IN THE TANK ARE SO DEEPLY DIVERGED FROM STINGRAYS THAT THERE ARE SO MANY GENETIC DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO THAT IT IS JUST NOT POSSIBLE. ALTHOUGH I CAN UNDERSTAND A LOT OF FOLKS BEING FASCINATED BY THE POSSIBILITY OF HYBRIDIZATION, IT IS PRETTY UNLIKELY. >>. DOCTOR, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US THIS MORNING. >>>.

THE MIDDLE OF THE COUNTRY WARM TEMPERATURES WELL ABOVE NORMAL FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR. WE WILL BREAK RECORDS ONCE AGAIN. TEMPERATURES 10,, 15, 25 DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL GUSTY WINDS, AND THAT WILL CREATE THE FIRE DANGER. RED FLAG WARNINGS THROUGH SATURDAY: IN THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN PLAINS, SNOW CONTINUES TO POUR DOWN SNOWFALL RATES ON SATURDAY: FOUR INCHES. FOR OUR BLIZZARD CONDITIONS- SUNDAY: THE SNOW CONTINUES, THE SIERRA NEVADA- WE WILL SEE THE SNOW TAPERING OFF, THE ROCKIES WILL SEE FEET OF SNOW AND MANY RECORDS WILL BE BROKEN.

277,reU31fxMPcA,Morning News NOW Full Broadcast - Feb. 29,NBC News,2024-02-29 17:06:04+00:00,"TIER ON THIS THURSDAY. I AM FRANCIS RIVERA. SEE YOU BACK HERE ON FRIDAY. >>>. RIGHT NOW ON THE MORNING NEWS HANGING IN THE BALANCE: THE FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP'S ELECTION INTERFERENCE NOW ON ITS WAY TO THE SUPREME COURT. THE JUSTICES WILL HEAR ARGUMENTS ABOUT HIS CLAIM TO PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY. IT COULD IMPACT WHETHER THE CASE EVEN GOES TO TRIAL BEFORE THE NOVEMBER ELECTION. BUT THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL LEAVING BOTH PRESIDENT TRUMP AND PRESIDENT BIDEN AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER MORE ON THEIR DUELING VISIT TO ADDRESS THE GROWING MIGRANT CRISIS. >>> SHUTDOWN, AVERTED. LAWMAKERS ARE SET TO VOTE ON A DEAL. MITCH McCONNELL ANNOUNCES HE IS STEPPING DOWN. HE IS STEPPING DOWN. >>>. I SERVED KENTUCKY AND IS IN IT, AND IT IS TIME FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF LEADERSHIP. >>>. WE WILL BRING YOU THE LATEST FROM THE CAPITOL. >>> HIGH RISK, STARTLING NEW FINDINGS ABOUT A POSSIBLE LINK BETWEEN MARIJUANA USE AND YOUR HEALTH. >>> HISTORY RESTORED. WE WILL TAKE YOU TO PITTSBURGH, TO THE HOME OF AMERICA'S FIRST BLACK OPERA COMPANY. >>> I AM JOE FRYER. SAVANNA IS ON ASSIGNMENT. >>> WE BEGIN WITH THAT DECISION FROM THE SUPREME COURT. THE JUSTICES WILL HEAR ARGUMENTS ABOUT WHETHER DONALD TRUMP CAN CLAIM PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY FROM ELECTION CHARGES THE WEEK OF APRIL 22nd. IT IS UNCLEAR- WHEN THE JUDGES WILL MAKE THEIR FINAL RULING IN THE MAIN TRIAL -- MEANTIME, NO TRIAL CAN TAKE PLACE. THERE IS A VERY GOOD POSSIBILITY. TRUMP COULD FACE BEFORE THIS NOVEMBER'S ELECTION. PROSECUTORS SAY TRUMP CONSPIRED TO OVERTURN LEGITIMATE ELECTION RESULTS. THE FORMER PRESIDENT HAS DENIED ANY WRONGDOING IN A LENGTHY SOCIAL POST. DOUBLING DOWN AND SAYING: ALL PRESIDENTS MUST HAVE COMPLETE AND TOTAL PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY, OR THE AUTHORITY AND DECISIVENESS OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WILL BE STRIPPED AND GONE FOREVER >>>. JOHN ALLEN IS STANDING BY TO HELP US BREAK DOWN WHAT THIS MEANS FOR THE ELECTION. BUT FIRST, LET'S BRING IN RYAN RILEY FOR MORE ON THE SUPREME COURT'S DECISION TO ACTUALLY HEAR THIS CASE. REMIND US WHAT IS AT STAKE AND HOW DID EVEN REVIEWING THIS CLAIM OF PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY? MAKE IT ALL THE WAY TO THE NATIONS HIGHEST COURT. >>. TIMELINE WISE. THE QUESTION IS WHETHER IT GETS TO TRIAL. REALLY, IT HAS ALL THE DUMBEST THING ABOUT THAT TIMELINE LAWYERS. DON'T THINK YOU CAN GET A FAIR TRIAL IN DC, AND THAT IS ONE OF THE MAIN ARGUMENTS. THEY ARE ALSO ARGUING ESSENTIALLY FOR TWO OF THE CHARGES TO BE DROPPED BECAUSE THEY DO NOT BELIEVE. THIS IS THE PROPER FOCUS OF THOSE CHARGES AND THIS IS THE WAY THAT THESE CHARGES WERE INTENDED TO BE USED IN TERMS OF OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE. HUNDREDS OF JANUARY 6th. WRITERS AS WELL BUT THIS IS A BIG WIN FOR DONALD TRUMP, BECAUSE IT RAISES THE POSSIBILITY THAT DESPITE THE GOVERNMENT OVERTURNING THE RESULTS OF A LEGITIMATE ELECTION AND DISENFRANCHISE MILLIONS OF VOTERS. HE MAY NOT FACE LEGAL CONSEQUENCES FOR THAT BEFORE WE GET TO NOVEMBER. WHAT HAPPENED HERE IS THE JUDGE SAID OVERALL THAT SHE WOULD GIVE SEVEN MONTHS FOR DONALD TRUMP TO REPAIR -- PREPARE. ORIGINALLY IT WAS SET TO GO OFF IN MARCH, NEXT WEEK, WHEN THE TRIAL WAS ORIGINALLY SET TO BEGIN. BECAUSE OF THE APPEAL, THERE ARE 80 DAYS LEFT IN THIS PREPARATION WINDOW. IF THE SUPREME COURT GIVES THE GO-AHEAD FOR THIS TRIAL TO PROCEED, WHICH COULD MONTHS FROM NOW? IT COULD COME IN MAY OR JUNE, THAT IS WHEN THAT TIMELINE WOULD BEGIN. THEN THEY START ULTIMATELY. THIS TRIAL WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO BEGIN UNTIL PERHAPS LATE AUGUST, EARLY SEPTEMBER, AND THAT IS QUICKLY GETTING INTO THAT WINDOW WHERE IT OVERLAPS WITH THE ELECTION AND THE TRIAL WOULD NOT BE OVER AND THE VERDICT WOULD NOT BE OUT BEFORE NOVEMBER. >>. WHAT ARE SOME OF THE ARGUMENTS THAT THE JUSTICES WILL HEAR FROM BOTH SIDES? >> I THINK WE CAN >> TO HEAR THAT FUNDAMENTAL DEBATE. TRUMP'S DEFENSE IS GOING TO ARGUE THAT THE DC CIRCUIT COURT ARE ACTUALLY WRONG WHEN THEY RECOGNIZED TOTAL IMMUNITY FOR HIS OFFICIAL ACT AS PRESIDENT, AND HE WILL PROBABLY FRAME THIS AS IT IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE SEPARATION OF POWERS. HE IS GOING TO ARGUE THAT, WITHOUT THAT IMMUNITY, ANY PRESIDENTIAL DECISION COULD BE CRIMINALLY PROSECUTED BY SUBSEQUENT ADMINISTRATION, WHICH REALLY HINDERS PRESIDENTIAL FUNCTION. ANY MONTH-LONG TRIAL, PARTICULARLY DURING THE ELECTION SEASON, WILL SEVERELY DISRUPT HIS CAMPAIGN EFFORTS AND INFRINGE ON AMERICAN VOTERS TO HEAR HIS MESSAGE. AND I THINK HE IS ALSO ARGUING THAT THAT IMPLICATES THE FIRST AMENDMENT. ALSO, HEARING FROM SPECIAL COUNSEL, HE IS GOING TO ARGUE THAT TRUMP'S BROAD CLAIM OF IMMUNITY IS ACCEPTED AND WOULD ACTUALLY BE EXTREMELY DANGEROUS BECAUSE IT WOULD UNDERMINE THE SYSTEM OF JUSTICE AND THE RULE OF LAW, BECAUSE IT WOULD ARGUE THAT NO PRESIDENT- THEY WILL ARGUE THAT NO PRESIDENT SHOULD BE IMMUNE FROM PROSECUTION FOR ACTIONS THAT THREATEN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS ITSELF AND, MORE IMPORTANTLY, THAT NO MAN, INCLUDING THE PRESIDENT, SHOULD BE ABOVE THE LAW. >>. THE LOWER COURT OBJECTED TO THE CLAIMS WHEN IT COMES TO PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY. THERE ARE A LOT OF ANALYST AND IT WAS NEARLY WRITTEN. ARE YOU SURPRISED? THE JUSTICES ARE TAKING THE CASE >>. I AM NOT SURPRISED, GIVEN THE MAKEUP OF OUR COURT, THE LOWER COURT DECISIONS CRITICALLY FRAME THE DEBATE ON THE PRESIDENTIAL POWERS BUT IT IS REALLY CRUCIAL TO REMEMBER THAT THE SUPREME COURT IS NOT BOUND BY THESE RULINGS. INSTEAD, THEY ARE BOUND OR GUIDED BY THEIR OWN PRESIDENTS. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE WAKE OF DECISIONS, THERE IS THAT GROWING SCRUTINY OVER HOW STEADFAST THE COURT WILL ADD TO ANY OF ITS PAST RULINGS. SO I AM NOT SURPRISED. IT IS AN IMPACTFUL RULING AND IMPACT OF POLITICAL RULING, AND IT WILL BE THE MOST IMPACTFUL POLITICAL RULING. STANDS BUSH VERSUS GORE, AND THAT WAS THE RULING THAT DECIDED THE ELECTION RIGHT. NOW ALL EYES WILL BE ON HOW THEY NAVIGATE THE PRESIDENT -- INCIDENTS >>>. LET'S BRING IN JONATHAN ALLEN ON THE POLITICAL IMPACT FROM FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S PERSPECTIVE. HOW BIG OF A WIN IS THIS FOR HIM? >>. IT COULD NOT BE A BIGGER WIN. ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES TO THE ELECTION SO FAR HAS BEEN THE PROCESS THAT HE WOULD HAVE A SPEEDY TRIAL, AS DEFENDANTS ARE USUALLY ENTITLED TO IN THIS COUNTRY, AND THAT HE WOULD BE CONVICTED OF A CRIME. NOW WHAT YOU HAVE GOT IS A TIMELINE THAT MAKES IT CERTAINLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR ALL OF THIS TO BE DECIDED BEFORE THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION STARTS TO GET INTO A FULL TIMELINE. AND THAT THAT POINT THE PARTY WOULD NOT HAVE, PERHAPS, A VIABLE CANDIDATE. IF HE WAS CONVICTED OF A CRIME, I THINK THERE WOULD BE A LOT IN THE COUNTRY THAT WOULD LOOK AT THAT AS UNFAIR EVEN IF THEY ACCEPTED A VERDICT FROM TRUMP. WE ARE GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE THE SUPREME COURT IS GIVING TRUMP A PASS ON THESE, GIVING TRUMP A PASS ON THESE CHARGES. EFFECTIVELY, IF HE GETS ELECTED, HE OF COURSE HAS THE ABILITY TO PARDON HIMSELF. AND YOU CANNOT PROSECUTE A SITTING PRESIDENT. THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT MIGHT WITHDRAW. >>. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE GOP NOMINATION PROCESS. THERE HAS BEEN A CHANCE THAT THE CASE THAT HAPPENED BEFORE ELECTION AND THAT IS LOOKING LESS LIKELY. SO HOW DOES THAT CHANGE? THE CAMPAIGN FOR BOTH TRUMP AND OPPONENT NIKKI HALEY? ONE OF HER SELLING POINTS IS THAT SHE IS A CANDIDATE FREE OF LEGAL PROBLEMS. DID SHE HAVE TO BELISLE OF THE RACE >>? SHE ONLY HAS TO BOW OUT WHEN SHE DOESN'T HAVE MONEY TO FLY HER PLANE ANYMORE OR TO GET ON A PLANE OR HAVE HOTEL ROOMS. BUT THE TRUTH IS THAT THIS RACE HAS BEEN OVER FOR QUITE SOME TIME, WITHOUT SOME SORT OF AN EXTERNAL INTERVENTION IN THIS RACE. DONALD TRUMP BY SUPER TUESDAY OR CERTAINLY FOLLOWING THAT. ONE OF THE REASONS NIKKI HALEY WILL HANG AROUND IS THAT TRUMP BECAME NOT LIABLE FOR TRIAL. TO YOUR POINT THAT POSSIBILITY HAS BEEN REMOVED, THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION WILL HAPPEN BEFORE ANY TRIAL. >>. LET'S LOOK AT CAPITOL HILL, BECAUSE THERE IS TALK THAT DEMOCRATS COULD DO SOMETHING- PRETTY EXTREME IF THE SUPREME COURT RULES IN FAVOR OF TRUMP IN THIS PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY CASE >>. THE DEMOCRATS HAVE TRIED TO PULL OUT ALL OF THE STOPS AND ARE LOOKING AT WAYS OF SHUTTING DOWN THE GOVERNMENT PROCESSES OR STRIPPING THE SUPREME COURT OF ALL KINDS OF MEASURES THEY MIGHT UNDERTAKE. IT IS HARD TO SEE THAT WORKING ESPECIALLY FOR A PARTY THAT THEY ARE, FOR A PARTY THAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT TO SUDDENLY TURN. >>. JOHN ALLEN, GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US >>>. FIRE CREWS IN TEXAS ARE BATTLING AS MANY AS 23 WILDFIRES RAGING ACROSS THE STATE. AT LEAST ONE PERSON HAS DIED AND MORE THAN 1 MILLION ACRES HAVE ALREADY BURNED, WITH DRY CONDITIONS AND HIGH WINDS. ONE OF THE FIRES CALLED THE SMOKEHOUSE CREEK. FIRE HAS SCORCHED 850,000 ACRES SO FAR. THAT IS BIGGER THAN THE STATE OF RHODE ISLAND, MAKING IT THE SECOND BIGGEST IN HISTORY. RESIDENTS OF THE PATH OF THE FIRE HAVE BEEN FORCED TO EVACUATE, ROADWAYS HAVE BEEN SHUT DOWN AND THE GOVERNOR HAS ISSUED A DISASTER FOR 60 COUNTIES. >>>. LET'S GET A CHECK ON YOUR MORNING AND THE WEATHER >>>. WE'VE GOT THE CHILL IN THE AIR FOR SURE ACROSS PORTIONS OF THE COUNTRY THAT HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH SOME MILDER CONDITIONS, NOT THE CASE THIS MORNING. LET'S START WITH THE NORTHEAST. YOU ARE WAKING UP TO TEMPERATURES MUCH CHILLIER THAN YOU PROBABLY WENT TO BED WITH CONDITIONS IN THE UPPER 30s FOR PITTSBURGH, 40s FOR NEW YORK, UPPER 40s FOR WASHINGTON DC, AND THOSE NUMBERS ARE PRETTY CLOSE TO WHERE THEY SHOULD BE. BUT A COUPLE OF SPOTS ARE COOLER THAN NORMAL AND DEFINITELY COOLER THAN WHAT WE WERE SEEING YESTERDAY AND THE DAY BEFORE THAT. AS WE LOOK TO THE WEST, NOTICE ACROSS PORTIONS OF THE MIDWEST, THE GREAT LAKES AND THE PLANES, WE WILL BE RUNNING WARM ONCE AGAIN, WE SAW A BIT OF A DIP IN TEMPERATURES FOR PLACES LIKE CHICAGO AND AS WE GET INTO TOMORROW, FOLKS IN CHICAGO 60s ACROSS KANSAS, MISSOURI AND ST LOUIS EVEN MINNEAPOLIS WILL BE RUNNING WAY ABOVE NORMAL. IT DOES RUN INTO PORTIONS OF THE NORTHEAST AND THE NEW ENGLAND AREA IN THE UPPER 40s AND UPPER 50s ACROSS THAT REGION. LOOK AT THIS ROLLER COASTER RIDE. WE WILL SEE PLACES LIKE CINCINNATI. GET INTO THE 60s ON SATURDAY. WE ARE INTO THE 70s ON SUNDAY. BY MONDAY WE ARE DEALING WITH MID-70s FOR CINCINNATI'S -- CINCINNATI EVEN CHICAGO WILL BE BACK INTO THE 70s, AFTER DEALING WITH THE 20s FOR YOUR HIGH YESTERDAY. IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE WEATHER, JUST WAIT A COUPLE OF DAYS, I SUPPOSE. NEW YORK ENDS INTO THE UPPER 50s FOR SUNDAY AND MONDAY AND WE WILL SEE THIS ROLLER COASTER RIDE CONTINUE. WE GET INTO MARCH TOMORROW- CHECK OUT THE RECORD WARMTH: 92% OF THE LOWER, 48 SO WARMER THAN NORMAL TEMPERATURES FOR THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY, AND DOZENS AND DOZENS OF CITIES SO TEMPERATURES WELL ABOVE NORMAL AND RECORDED THE WARMEST FEBRUARY EVER. ON RECORD YOU HAVE PLACES LIKE MINNEAPOLIS, MILWAUKEE, CHICAGO- ALL INCLUDED IN THAT- AS FAR SOUTH, AS LITTLE ROCK, QUITE WARM, AND PLACES LIKE FARGO, RUNNING 50 DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL FOR THIS TIME OF THE YEAR FOR THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY. WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN MARCH TODAY, PARTS OF THE SOUTHERN PLAINS PICKING UP RAIN, STRETCHING FROM TEXAS TO MISSISSIPPI- SOME MUCH-NEEDED RAIN FOR FOLKS THERE- AND WE RAMP UP THE RAIN ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST TOMORROW, A BIT OF A WINTRY MIX. RAINFALL AMOUNTS ANYWHERE, FROM .5 INCHES TO AN INCH. THE CAROLINAS AND THE COASTAL REGION COULD SEE UP TO TWO INCHES. OUT WEST- A DIFFERENT STORY- WINTER IN FULL EFFECT AND WE COULD BE SEEING THE STRONGEST WINTER STORM OF THE SEASON FOR PARTS OF THE MOUNTAIN REGIONS. WE ARE GOING TO SEE LIZARD CONDITIONS AND WE ARE ALREADY DEALING WITH THE RAIN AND THE SNOW. ACROSS PORTIONS OF WASHINGTON, OREGON AND NORTHERN CALIFORNIA, THE HEAVY SNOW WILL REALLY START TO RAMP UP. BUT IT IS NOT JUST THE SNOW BUT THE WINDS, THE DECREASED VISIBILITY, AND NOT JUST AT THE HIGH ELEVATIONS. WE WILL SEE IMPRESSIVE SNOWFALL RATES. ONE TO TWO INCHES AN HOUR IS LIKELY FOR PARTS OF THE SIERRA RANGE, BUT WE COULD SEE THREE TO FIVE INCHES AN HOUR. THIS IS THE STRONGEST OF THE SEASON AND IT IS GOING TO PACK A PUNCH FOR THE FOLKS THERE. FIVE TO SIX INCHES OF SNOW, BECAUSE WE ARE RUNNING WELL BELOW NORMAL. WE ARE GOING TO NEED TO -- WE WILL NEED THAT ONCE SUMMER COMES AROUND >>>. TODAY, TEXAS WILL BE THE SCENE OF A DIFFERENT KIND OF DUAL: MY DUELING VISITS MADE BY BOTH FORMER, PRESIDENT TRUMP AND PRESIDENT BIDEN. BOTH WILL DISCUSS THE SITUATION AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER. IT IS A CHANCE FOR BOTH TO LAYOUT THEIR POLICY PLANS. JAY GRAY JOINS US NOW FROM TEXAS, WHERE PRESIDENT BIDEN IS EXPECTED TO BE THIS AFTERNOON. WHAT CAN WE? >> FROM HIS VISIT. WHAT IS HIS MESSAGE? >>. Reporter. IT IS THE SECOND VISIT OF PRESIDENT BIDEN TAKING OFFICE. THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS HE WILL MEET WITH BORDER PATROL AGENTS AND GET SOME FEEDBACK ON THE CURRENT SITUATION ALONG THE BORDER. HE IS ALSO HERE TO RATCHET UP MORE PRESSURE ON CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS TO MOVE ON BIPARTISAN BORDER SECURITY MEASURES. THERE HAS BEEN A BACK- AND-FORTH ON CAPITOL HILL AND BETWEEN THE WHITE HOUSE ON GETTING SOMETHING DONE. HE WILL LAY OUT WHAT HE BELIEVES IS THE FASTEST WAY TO EASE TENSION AND PROBLEMS ALONG THE BORDER, AND LOOKING FOR AN AUDIENCE THAT MAY STEP UP A PUSH TO GET SOMETHING DONE IN WASHINGTON >>. TRUMP IS SET TO DELIVER HIS REMARKS IN EAGLE PASS. I ASSUME THAT WILL BE A DIFFERENT VISIT RIGHT >>. Reporter. NO QUESTION, JOE, HE IS 300 MILES OR SO. THE BORDER ISSUE HAS BEEN A PRIMARY PART OF HIS CAMPAIGN, A FOCUS ALONG THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL AND, TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF HOW HE MAY ADDRESS THINGS OVERNIGHT THE CAMPAIGN VIDEO ON SOCIAL MEDIA LINKING THAT MURDER TO PRESIDENT BIDEN AND THE ADMINISTRATION'S OPEN BORDER POLICY. SO HE IS ON FULL ATTACK AS HE COMES HERE TO TEXAS >>. WHILE WE HAVE YOU AND PRESIDENT BIDEN'S ANNUAL PHYSICAL YESTERDAY, HIS AGE AND HEALTH ARE A MAJOR CONCERN AND ISSUE FOR VOTERS. WHAT ARE WE HEARING? >>. Reporter. THE DOCTOR SAYS THAT HE IS FIT FOR DUTY. THE PRESIDENT'S HEALTH HAS BEEN THE PRESIDENT'S HEALTH HAS BEEN AND CONTINUES TO BE. BOTH OF THESE MEN ARE UP IN THEIR YEARS AND THERE ARE A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THEIR ABILITY TO SERVE. THE PHYSICIAN SAYS. THE PRESIDENT SHOWS NO EVIDENCE OF MENTAL OR PHYSICAL ISSUES, HE CAN PURSUE ALL OF HIS RESPONSIBILITIES. >>>. TODAY, ON CAPITOL HILL, THE HOUSE IS SET TO VOTE ON A SHORT- TERM BILL THAT WOULD AVERT A POSSIBLE SHOT DOWN THIS WEEK. THE STOPGAP WOULD FIND FEDERAL AGENCIES INTO MARCH. THE DEAL WOULD BUY LAWMAKERS MORE TIME TO PASS A FUNDING BILL DOWN THE ROAD. THIS COMES. HOURS AFTER, MITCH McCONNELL SHOT THE POLITICAL WORLD ANNOUNCING HE WILL STEP DOWN LATER THIS YEAR. THAT WILL BRING TO AN END. HIS TIME IS THE LONGEST-SERVING LEADER IN SENATE HISTORY. LET'S BRING IN OUR CAPITOL HILL. CORRESPONDENT. CORRESPONDENT. TELL US ABOUT THE STOPGAP >>. Reporter. THIS IS AN EXTENSION OF THE EXTENSION THAT LAWMAKERS GAVE EARLIER THIS YEAR. THE HOPE, ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS, IS THAT THIS WILL BE ENOUGH TIME, WITH ONE ADDITIONAL WEEK TO FUND THE GOVERNMENT AND A COUPLE OF WEEKS AFTER THAT TO FUND THE SECOND HALF, OR LAWMAKERS TO FINISH THESE BILLS FOR THE REST OF THE FISCAL YEAR. ALL OF THE LEADERS ARE ON BOARD WITH THIS CONGRESS AND THE NUMBER OF VOTES IT WOULD TAKE TO GET THIS ACROSS THE FINISH LINE. I THINK WE HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE WHERE THE VOTES ARE. WE ARE NOT GOING TO ACCIDENTALLY WANDER INTO A SHUTDOWN OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. >> THE SURPRISING NEWS OF MITCH McCONNELL STEPPING DOWN AS SENATE LEADER. HE HAS BEEN THE LEADER SINCE 2007.. >> THE LONGEST SERVING LEADER FOR EITHER PARTY. HE HAS BEEN IN THE SENATE LONGER THAN I HAVE BEEN ALIVE FIRST. WE HAVE SEEN BOTH HIS POLITICAL STRENGTH AND HIS PHYSICAL STRENGTH FADING A LITTLE BIT OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. HE HAD THOSE FREEZING INCIDENTS LAST YEAR, AFTER RECOVERING FROM A CONCUSSION, AWAY FROM HIS BRAND OF CONSERVATISM AND MORE TOWARD, THE TRUMP BRAND. SOME OF HIS THINKING ABOUT HIS LEGACY, WHICH HE DISCUSSED ON THE FLOOR YESTERDAY. >>. I ALWAYS IMAGINED A MOMENT WHEN I HAD TOTAL CLARITY AND PEACE ABOUT THE SUNSET OF MY WORK, THE MOMENT WHEN I AM CERTAIN I THE MOMENT WHEN I AM CERTAIN I HAVE HEALTH PRESERVED IDEAS >>. I THINK THE IDEA THAT McCONNELL WILL EVENTUALLY HANG IT UP. HE IS 82 YEARS OLD AND IT IS NOT PARTICULARLY SURPRISING. BUT THE SUDDENNESS OF THIS YESTERDAY CAUGHT EVERYONE OFF GUARD. IT WAS A SHOCKING MOMENT IN THE CHAMBER. >>. YOU TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE PARTY IS MOVING AWAY FROM ITS STYLE. THE QUESTION IS, WHO WILL TAKE OVER? >> THREE FRONT RUNNERS: THE GOP JOHN'S. JOHN FROM SOUTH DAKOTA, WHO IS A CURRENT SENATE MEMBER NUMBER TWO BEFORE HIM, AND JOHN FROM WYOMING, WHO IS THE CURRENT NUMBER THREE BUT PROBABLY THE NUMBER THREE BUT PROBABLY THE CLOSEST TO THE MAGA PARTY. I WILL BE THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION, WITH THE SMALLEST CONSTITUENCY IN YEARS >>>. MUCH MORE TO COME LATER THIS HOUR, BUT IN CONCERNS ABOUT THE LONG-TERM IMPACTS OF SMOKING MARIJUANA, THE NEW STUDY FOUND AND WHAT THE DOCTORS WANT YOU TO KNOW. WE HAVE MORE ON THAT STORY >>>. NOW TURNING TO THE MIDDLE EAST, WHERE THE WAR IN GAZA HAS REACHED A DEVASTATING MILESTONE. MORE THAN 30,000 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED INSIDE GAZA. LOCAL OFFICIALS ON AN ISRAELI ATTACK THAT KILLED DOZENS OF PEOPLE WAITING FOR HUMANITARIAN AID IN GAZA CITY, AND THE LET TERRY IS LOOKING INTO THAT REPORT. THE HUMAN RIGHTS CHIEF CALLED FOR AN INVESTIGATION INTO WAR CRIMES HE SAYS ARE BEING COMMITTED BY ISRAEL AND HAMAS >>. THE WAR IN GAZA MUST END. CLEAR. VIOLATIONS OF THE RIGHTS AND HUMANITARIAN LAWS, INCLUDING WAR CRIMES AND POSSIBLY OTHER CRIMES ON INTERNATIONAL LAW, HAVE BEEN COMMITTED BY ALL PARTIES, AND THERE IS IMMINENT RISK OF FAMINE. ALMOST ALL ARE DRINKING SALTY AND CONTAMINATED WATER IN NORTHERN GAZA. MANY ARE BELIEVED TO BE STARVING >>. LET'S BRING IN JOSH LETTERMAN. LET'S START WITH THAT ATTACK ON A CROWD OF PALESTINIANS WAITING FOR FOOD AID. WHAT ARE WE CARING? -- HEARING >>. Reporter, THAT DEATH TOLL HAS CLIMBED TO 100.. RELEASED OVER THE LAST FEW MINUTES, HAMAS AND GAZA OFFICIALS ARE SAYING THAT THESE PEOPLE WERE SIMPLY SEARCHING FOR FOOD IN ONE OF THE HARDEST HIT PARTS OF THE GAZA STRIP WHEN THEY CAME UNDER ISRAELI FIRE. THE ISRAELI MILITARY HAS SAID THEY WERE ACTUALLY ELUDING AND ENDED UP TRAMPLING EACH OTHER. BUT WE ARE HEARING FROM AN ISRAELI GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL WHO SAYS THAT, IN THE COURSE OF THAT MAYHEM, SOME OF THESE WERE ACTUALLY APPROACHING TROOPS THERE TO SECURE THAT HUMANITARIAN CONVOY IN A WAY THAT HAIL THREAT INTO THE MILITARY AND THE MILITARY RESPONDED WITH LIVE FIRE. THAT DOES SEEM TO BE AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT THAT IT WAS ACKNOWLEDGMENT THAT IT WAS INVOLVING THESE DEATHS- JUST THE LATEST SIGN OF HOW THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IS FUELING MORE VIOLENCE WITHIN THE GAZA STRIP >>. LET'S TALK MORE ABOUT THAT. WHEN IT COMES TO FOOD AGENCIES SOUNDING THE ALARM ABOUT FOOD IN GAZA, SIX CHILDREN RECENTLY DIED OF MALNUTRITION AND DEHYDRATION. WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THAT? >>. Reporter. A HUGE FOCUS OF THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN THE NORTHERN GAZA STRIP IS AN AREA THAT IS REAL, URGED ALL CIVILIANS TO FLEE MONTHS AGO. THOSE WHO ARE STILL THERE ARE CUT OFF FROM THE REST OF GAZA AND, IN LARGE PART, FROM HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE, HEARING FROM A DOCTOR AND ONE OF THE HOSPITALS ON THE GAZA STRIP SPOKE TO ALBERT -- TO OUR TEAM. >> WE ARE HUNGRY AND WE ARE >>. WE ARE HUNGRY AND WE ARE HAVING A DIFFICULT LIFE. WE LOST ABOUT FOUR CHILDREN TO STARVATION AND DEHYDRATION >>. Reporter. THE UNITED NATIONS SAYS AID INTO THE GAZA STRIP FELL 50% COMPARED TO WHAT IT WAS LAST MONTH WHEN IT WAS ALREADY INSUFFICIENT. OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS WE HAVE SEEN A SHIFT IN STRATEGY. FOUR NATIONS HAVE STARTED TO AIRDROP INTO THE GAZA STRIP, INCLUDING JORDAN, CANADA, THE UK PROVIDING AID DROPPED BY AIRCRAFT AT THE GAZA STRIP. CLEARLY ALL COMPANIES -- COUNTRIES- ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET FOOD INTO THE GAZA STRIP. >>. WHERE DO WE STAND IN THE HOSTAGE TALKS? >>. Reporter. WE HAVE NOT SEEN ANY SIGNS OF OPTIMISM SINCE THOSE COMMENTS FROM PRESIDENT BIDEN. WE HAVE HEARD FROM HAMAS SAYING: THERE IS NO BREAKTHROUGH AND THEY ARE STANDING FIRM BEHIND THEIR DECISION. WE KNOW THAT. TALKS CONTINUE TO GO ON AND COUNTRIES ARE HEAVILY INVOLVED, TRYING TO BROKER A DEAL. THEY ARE TALKING TO ISRAEL AND THE UNITED STATES. THERE IS NO DEAL. >>>. HUNTER BIDEN IS CALLING THE GOP IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY INTO HIS FATHER A CHARADE BASED ON MOTIVATED CONSPIRACIES. THE YOUNGER BIDEN, FINALLY TESTIFIED BEFORE THE TWO COMMITTEES, AREN'T TRYING TO IMPEACH PRESIDENT BIDEN. REPUBLICANS CLAIM THE FUNDS USED THE REPUBLICAN BRAND BUT HAVE NOT OFFERED ANY CONCRETE. NOT OFFERED ANY CONCRETE EVIDENCE TO BACK IT UP. >>. THEY HAVE PRODUCED NO EVIDENCE TO DO WITH ANY FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING HUNTER WITH HIS FATHER PERIOD >>. SARA FITZPATRICK, GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. IT WAS A CLOSED DOOR SESSION BUT WE ARE LEARNING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED. WALK US THROUGH THE DEPOSITION >>. THE DEPOSITION LASTED OVER SIX HOURS AND IN THAT TIME THEY GOT VERY HEATED KERFUFFLE OVER LINES OF QUESTIONING AND PARTICULARLY IN THE FIRST HOUR, TO FOCUS ON HUNTER'S BUSINESS DEALINGS. IN HUNTER'S OPENING STATEMENTS WE ARE TOLD BY HIS ATTORNEY THROUGHOUT TESTIMONY THAT HE WAS VERY CLEAR, THAT AT NO TIME WAS HIS FATHER INVOLVED IN ANY OF HIS BUSINESSES. HIS ATTORNEY TOLD US LAST NIGHT THAT ATTORNEYS PROVIDED NOT ONE SHRED OF EVIDENCE. I WAS STRESSED BY THE CERTAINTY HUNTER'S LEGAL TEAM HAD, BECAUSE ANYTHING HUNTER SAID UNDER OATH COULD BE USED IN THE TWO FEDERAL CRIMINAL TRIALS HE IS FACING. >>. SOURCES PREVIOUSLY SAID THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN'S TESTIMONY WOULD BE THE CHRIS IN OF THE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY. IS THAT STILL THE CASE? STILL THE CASE. WHAT ARE YOU HEARING? >>. THEY HAVE MADE CLAIMS BUT WHEN THEY CAME OUT OF THE DEPOSITION YESTERDAY THE HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN SAYING THE DEPOSITION >> Reporter PROVED SEVERAL BITS OF EVIDENCE. HE COULD ONLY POINT TO QUOTE INCONSISTENCIES. LISTEN TO THOSE WORDS, INCONSISTENCIES. THOSE ARE NOT THE WORDS OF A SMOKING GUN. AND WHAT THEY WOULD NEED FOR GROUNDS OF IMPEACHMENT >>. WHAT COMES NEXT >>. THE COMMITTEE HAS TOLD US THAT THE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY IS ONGOING. THEY >> A REPORT ON ALL OF THE FINDINGS TO BE READY SOMETIME THIS SPRING. WE HEARD FOR THE FIRST TIME YESTERDAY THAT THEY ARE GOING TO MOVE INTO A NEW PHASE INCLUDING A PUBLIC HEARING. EXACTLY WHAT THAT WILL IMPEL AND WHO WILL BE THERE REMAINS TO BE SEEN. BUT A PUBLIC HEARING WHERE THE AMERICAN CAN HEAR -- AMERICANS CAN HEAR DIRECTLY. AMERICANS CAN HEAR DIRECTLY FROM HUNTER BIDEN >>> AND EXECUTION STOPPED. WE COME BACK ON WHAT HAPPENED AND RENEWING CONCERNS ABOUT CAPITOL PUNISHMENT >>>. CONCERN ABOUT THE LONG-TERM. YOU'VE GOT TO SEE THIS. STAY TUNED ON NBC NEWS NOW >>>. THE EXECUTION OF ONE OF THE NATIONS LONGEST-SERVING DEATH ROW, INMATES, WAS DELAYED IN IDAHO YESTERDAY. THAT IS RAISING QUESTIONS ABOUT LETHAL INJECTION >>. Reporter. THE EXECUTION OF THE LONGEST-SERVING DEATH ROW IN EIGHT HALTED AFTER SEVERAL FAILED ATTEMPTS TO ADMINISTER A LETHAL INJECTION. >>. IT WASN'T A DIFFICULT DECISION. IT WAS THE RIGHT DECISION. >>. Reporter. HE WAS SENT TO BE EXECUTED NEAR BOISE PRISON. OFFICIALS SAY THE MEDICAL TEAM MADE EIGHT ATTEMPTS IN MULTIPLE AREAS TO ESTABLISH AN IV LINE. BEFORE ESTABLISH AN IV LINE, BEFORE PAUSING THE EXECUTION. MEDIA WITNESSES DESCRIBE HOW THE 73-YEAR-OLD LADY STRAPPED ON THE EXECUTION TABLE FOR MORE THAN 45 MINUTES AT TIMES LOOKING OVER AND WAVING AT HIS FAMILY. HE WAS CONVICTED OF FIVE MURDERS AND HAS BEEN IN PRISON SINCE 1974.. HIS FAILED EXECUTION COMING WEEKS AFTER. ALABAMA EXECUTED A MAN USING NITROGEN GAS FOR THE FIRST TIME AFTER ATTEMPTING TO USE AN IV, WHICH ALSO DID NOT WORK. IN IDAHO, THERE IS A DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVE: >> IDAHO OFFERS EXECUTION BY LETHAL INJECTION. ORDER FIRING SQUAD NOW. >>. Reporter, ANOTHER CONVICTED MURDERER IS SET FOR EXECUTION IN TEXAS. HE SAYS HE IS INNOCENT AND HIS SUPPORTERS ARE TRYING TO STOP IT. ALL OF THIS CONTINUING TO RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT CAPITOL PUNISHMENT AND THE MOST HUMANE WAY TO CARRY OUT AN EXECUTION. >>. THEY ARE LETTING THE DEATH WARRANT EXPIRE AS THEY WORK TO FIGURE OUT THE NEXT STEPS. >>>. A NEW STUDY FINDS THAT USING MARIJUANA AS LITTLE AS ONCE A MONTH IS LINKED TO A GREATER RISK OF HEART ATTACK AND STROKE. RESEARCHERS AT GENERAL MASS LOOKED AT DATA FROM NEARLY 500,000 PATIENTS- ONE OF THE LARGEST STUDIES- TO MAKE THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE DRUG AND THESE HEALTH ISSUES. THEY ALSO FIND THESE RISKS GROW SHARPLY THE MORE FREQUENTLY MERRILL 18 IS USED -- MARIJUANA IS USED. DO THE RESEARCHERS A DIRECT LINK? WHO SHOULD BE MOST CONCERNED? >>. THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE FIRST STUDIES WHERE WE HAVE THIS COMPREHENSIVE DATA LOOKING AT FOUR YEARS, 27 STATES, ALL ADULTS- WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING ON YOUTH OR ADOLESCENT- BASICALLY 418 AND OVER OVER THE LAST 30 DAYS THEY ASKED IF THERE WAS ANY MARIJUANA USE. WHATSOEVER, PRIMARILY SMOKING IS WHERE WE SEE AN EFFECT AND WHAT THEY FOUND IS THAT PEOPLE WITH DAILY USE OF MARIJUANA LARGELY FOR SMOKING HAD A 42% INCREASE OF RISK OF STROKE OR HEART ATTACK. THAT WAS SIGNIFICANT. ALSO, THAT IS INDEPENDENT FROM SMOKING TOBACCO PEOPLE SAY MARIJUANA SMOKE IS. PEOPLE SAY MARIJUANA SMOKE IS NOT AS BAD AS TOBACCO SMOKING. EVEN PEOPLE THAT USE IT WEEKLY HAVE AN ELEVATED RISK. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT MARIJUANA, ESPECIALLY IN THE FORM OF SMOKING, CAN POSE SIGNIFICANT HEALTH HAZARDS. >>. THE NATIONAL SURVEY FINDS ONE OUT OF FIVE PEOPLE OVER THE AGE OF 12 NOW REPORTS USING IT IN THE LAST YEAR, ESPECIALLY THE YOUNGER PEOPLE OVER THE AGE OF 12.. WHAT ARE SOME OF THE HEALTH RISKS? >> SOME INCREDIBLE HEALTH RISK. WE NEED TO STUDY ADOLESCENCE MORE CLOSELY, ESPECIALLY AS WE SEE A RISE IN OBESITY- HIGH CHOLESTEROL FOR THAT POPULATION THINKING ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OR MATURITY OF LUNGS. YOU CAN GET MATURITY OF LUNGS. YOU CAN GET AN UNFORTUNATE EXPOSURE WITH A VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF SMOKING. I THINK THIS IS EXACTLY WHERE RESEARCHERS ARE POINTING, AND WE SHOULD POINT OUT THAT IN MANY STATES IT IS LEGAL AND I THINK THERE HAS BEEN A PERCEPTION THAT THERE IS NO HARM WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR PHYSICAL- NO MATTER WHAT AGE YOU ARE- AND THE DOCTORS AND HEALTH PROFESSIONALS LISTENING. THIS SHOULD BE ADDED IN WITH YOUR TOBACCO SMOKE SCREENING, ASKING SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT MARIJUANA USE >>. HOW, ABOUT VAPING OR USING EDIBLES, ARE THOSE CONSIDERED SIMILAR? HOW DOES THAT MAKE THE PICTURE MORE COMPLICATED? >>. IT IS MUCH MORE COMPLICATED BECAUSE VAPING, WHICH WAS THOUGHT TO BE A SAFER ALTERNATIVE, ACTUALLY TURNS OUT THAT YOU EXPOSE LUNGS TO SOME OF THESE TOXINS, PARTICULARLY WHEN THE PRODUCTS ARE LABELED IN A MANNER WHERE IT IS NOT CLEAR WHAT THAT EXPOSURE IS BOTTOM LINE. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR SAFER ALTERNATIVES, LOOK TO PRODUCTS THAT DON'T HAVE THAT TO THE COMPONENT. THE MORE TOXIC COMPONENT TEND TO LOOK FOR PRODUCTS WITH CANNABINOIDS. CBD IS PROBABLY THE MOST FAMILIAR PRODUCT WHICH DOESN'T HAVE AS MUCH OF THAT PSYCHEDELIC EFFECT BUT FOR ME IT IS VERY CLEAR THAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE AN INCREDIBLE CONVERSATION, NOT JUST ABOUT MARIJUANA USE, BUT TO YOUR POINT, NOT JUST SMOKING BUT ACCESS TO THESE TALKS AND AND OTHER PRODUCTS. JULIE, WE HAVE NOT STUDIED ENOUGH AND THERE ARE MORE PRODUCTS DEVELOPED THAN WE EVEN UNDERSTAND. THIS STUDY FROM THE ATIONAL HEART AND BLOOD INSTITUTE POINTS TO THE EFFECTS OF SMOKING MARIJUANA AND THERE ARE CLUES TO OTHER FORMS >>. I CANNOT PRONOUNCE THAT WORD EITHER. >> CBD >>> COMING UP FIGHTING BACK AGAINST GIFT CARDS- THE FIRST OF ITS KIND BILL MEANT TO KEEP VIDEO. DOWNLOAD THE NBC NEWS APP NOW >>> WELCOME BACK.

THE CARDS ARE CREATED BASED ON WHAT WE HAVE DONE -- >>. Reporter, YOU ARE SAYING IT COULD BE AN INSIDE JOB? >> ABSOLUTELY. RESEARCH TELLS US THE NUMBER ON THE BACK OF THE CARD. THEY ARE ENTERING THAT INTO A PROGRAM AND THAT PROGRAM CONSTANTLY CHECKS IT TO SEE WHEN IT IS ACTIVATED. AS SOON AS IT IS ACT ABATED, IT PUTS MONEY ON AN ACCOUNT FOR SOMEONE. >>. Reporter KROGER ALLEGING THE COMPANY FAILED TO TAKE MEASURES TO PROTECT THE GIFT CARDS AGAINST UNAUTHORIZED TAMPERING. KROGER DID NOT REPLY BUT OFFERED TO REPLACE THE GIFT CARDS.

YO DON'T HAVE A PRESIDENCY. >>. THE STAKES SKY HIGH FOR THE FORMER PRESIDENT, WHO HAS CAS THE PROSECUTION ITSELF, A ELECTION INTERFERENCE AND JACK SMITH'S TEAM, WHICH HA ACCUSED TRUMP OF DEFRAUDING TH GOVERNMENT. HE ONCE LED. >>.

THE JUSTICES CURRENTLY WEIGHIN COLORADO'S MOVE TO BAN TRUMP FROM THE BALLOT VOTERS THERE SET TO GO TO TH POLLS NEXT WEEK. ON SUPER TUESDAY AND LATE WEDNESDAY, ILLINOIS BECAME THE THIRD STATE TO FIND THE FORMER PRESIDENT INELIGIBL TO SERVE UNDER THE CONSTITUTION'S INSURECTION CLAUSE OF THE 14th AMENDMENT. I LIGHT OF HIS ROLE. IN JANUARY 6th, AN APPEALS COURT JUDGE IN NE YORK REJECTED TRUMP'S EFFORT T AVOID PAYING THE MASSIVE CIVIL FRAUD JUDGMENT FOR MORE THAN $450 MILLION. AS HE TRIES T APPEAL THE DECISION, HIS ATTORNEYS SAYING IN A LEGA FILING: HE MAY NEED TO SELL OF SOME OF THE PROPERTIES TO COVE IT IF HE CAN'T GET A BOND BACK TO YOU >>. THANK YOU SO MUCH. LET'S BRING IN LEGAL ANALYST ANGELA CENEDELLA WITH MORE O THIS. OBVIOUSLY LEGAL EXPERTS AR WEIGHING IN ON THIS, AND SO ARE POLITICIANS. NO SURPRISE: NANCY PELOSI IS SAYING THAT TH SUPREME COURT IS PLACING ITSEL ON TRIAL. IT IS ALWAYS TRICKY WHEN THE SUPREME COURT HAS TO GET INT THESE POLITICALLY CHARGED ISSUE. WHEN THEY DO GET INVOLVED, WHA IS THE IMPACT ON PUBLIC TRUS FOR THE INSTITUTION? >>. SO YOU CAN, UNDERSTAND THA PUBLIC TRUST IN THIS CASE WOUL BE WANING. IRONICALLY, WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE SUPREME COURT WILL EN UP RULING IN TRUMP'S FAVOR. THERE IS ALMOST RULE. THA PRESIDENTS WILL NEVER BE LIABL FOR ANY CRIMINAL ACT WHATSOEVE IN THE OFFICIAL DUTIES OF TH PRESIDENCY. GIVEN THAT IT APPEARS THA TRUMP WILL NOT BE LET OFF TH HOOK. BUT THE SUPREME COURT, BEHIND CLOSED DOORS, DON'T SEE THEM AS POLITICAL. THEY SEE THEM AS CONSERVATIV AND LIBERAL BUT THEY DO NOT. THEY MAY ALMOST BE ARGUING THA IF THEY WERE TO NOT TO TAKE ON THIS CASE BECAUSE THEN IT COULD AFFECT THE ELECTION IN A DIFFERENT WAY. THAT THAT ITSELF IS TOO POLITICAL. SO, FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE, THE ARE SAYING: THEY STAND THE TEST OF TIME AND REASONING WILL G FOR GENERATIONS >>. WE HAVE NEVER SEEN PRESIDENT FACE CRIMINAL CHARGE LIKE THIS. BUT ISSUES AROUND TH PRESIDENCY DO MAKE IT TO THE COURT ALL THE TIME. HOW COMMON IS IT TO SEE TH SUPREME COURT HAVE T CONTINUALLY ADDRESS THESE ISSUES AROUND PRESIDENTS AND AROUND ELECTIONS >>. IT MAKES SENSE. THEY WOULD. WHO ELSE IS GOING TO? THESE ARE MOMENTOUS ISSUES AND AFFECT EVERYONE IN THE COUNTRY. THE SUPREME COURT HAS INTERVENED BUT THEY DO IT AS LITTLE A POSSIBLE. THERE ARE BANS HERE AND BANS THERE. I BELIEVE THE SUPREME COURT WILL CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THEY WIL STAND THE TEST OF TIME >>. SO THE SUPREME COURT IS LOOKING AT ONE SPECIFIC CASE HERE. THAT IS THE FEDERAL ELECTIONS CASE. THE FORMER PRESIDENT FACES CHARGES IN THREE OTHER CASES RIGHT NOW. WILL THE DECISION HERE BY TH SUPREME COURT- IF THEY SAY YES, HE HAS PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY, DOES THAT AFFECT ALL OF TH CRIMINAL CASES? >>. THIS IS RELEVANT, NOT IN NEW YORK. HE DIDN'T RAISE THE DEFENSE OF CRIMINAL IMMUNITY BECAUSE THOS ACTS WERE NOT INVOLVED IN HI PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE TERMS. IN TERMS OF GEORGIA AND FLORIDA, YES, IF HE WERE TO BE GIVEN PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY, THE WOULD APPLY ACROSS THE BOARD. THIS HAS BEEN TRUMP'S FAVORITE ARGUMENT TO RAISE, BECAUSE I WAS PRESIDENT, NONE OF THE CHARGES SHOULD APPLY. IN GEORGIA, WE SAW ALL OF TH DELAYS WITH FANI WILLIS, AN WHETHER OR NOT. SHE WAS DATIN HER FELLOW PROSECUTOR >>. WE HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU FOR HELPING US ANSWERING SOME OF THEM. >>>.

THIS IS NOT JUST A TODAY PROBLEM. IT WILL LAST WELL INTO THE WEEKEND. THE HEAVY RAIN HAS STARTED T INCH CLOSER TO THE COAST. WE HAVE SNOW FALLING IN TH PACIFIC NORTHWEST AND PLENTY O WINTER ALERTS IN EFFECT RIGH. NOW WE HAVE BLIZZARD WARNING ALREADY IN EFFECT ACROSS PARTS OF THE SIERRA RANGE. THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE SEEING. I PURPLE THE WATCHES. WARNINGS AN ADVISORIES ARE UP AS WELL. THIS IS THE REASON WE WILL HAV TO DEAL WITH SOME HEAVY SNOW, HEAVY RAIN, STRONG WINDS AND DETERIORATING CONDITIONS OVE THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. HERE'S HOW IT PLAYS OUT. TODAY WE WILL SEE HEAVIER SNOW REACHING PORTIONS OF NORTHER CALIFORNIA. THE RAIN WILL ALSO BE AN ISSUE IN PORTIONS OF THE COASTAL AREAS. WE WILL SEE LIKELY LOW VISIBILITY AND SOME OF THOSE STRONG WINDS THAT I MENTIONED. THAT IS ALL ON THE TABLE TODAY. IT CONTINUES FOR TOMORROW. WE SEE ANOTHER SYSTEM GETS CLOSER TO THE COAST. THIS WILL RAMP THINGS UP. FOR US IT IS NOT JUST A TODAY PROBLEM. WE WILL SEE IT GET A LOT WORSE BEFORE IT GETS BETTER. WE WILL SEE RAIN CLES TO THE COAST AND THE SNOWFALL RATES WILL BE 1 TO 2 INCHES PER HOUR. WE COULD SEE THEM HIGHER THA THAT. THIS IS 72 HOURS STRAIGHT FOR THREE DAYS. THESE ARE TH CONDITIONS WE WILL BE DEALIN WITH ESPECIALLY ACROSS TH SIERRA RANGE. WE WILL SEE HEAVY RAIN I PORTIONS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNI ON SATURDAY. IT WILL BE A LITTLE SOGGY FO FOLKS THERE. WE WILL STILL BE DEALING WIT SNOW AS WE GET THROUGH SATURDA AND EARLY SUNDAY. SPEAKING ABOUT THE SNOW, I MENTIONED THE BLIZZARD WARNING, AND THAT IS BECAUSE WE HAVE NO JUST THE HEAVY SNOW BUT WE ARE TALKING STRONG WINDS: 60 TO 10 MILES PER HOUR IN SPOTS. THE VISIBILITY WILL BE ZERO. WE WILL SEE DIFFICULT TRAVEL. THE ROADS WILL BE DANGEROUS. THIS WILL BE SOMETHING THA LOWERS BECAUSE OF HOW COLD IT IS. AS WELL, WE WILL SEE THE LOWER SNOW LEVELS TOO PARTS OF THE SIERRA. FOOTHILL COULD SEE INCREDIBLE AMOUNTS O SNOW AS WELL. IT IS NOT JUST THE HIGHE ELEVATIONS LIKE WE SAW BEFOR THIS SEASON, THEY ARE GEARING UP FOR HEAV SNOW AT THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS DAWNER PASS 7 TO 10 FEET. 4 TO 7 FEET POSSIBLE AT 4700 FEET FOR BLUE CANYON. UP AND DOWN I-80, EVEN AS LOW AS COLFAX'S ELEVATION. YOU WILL STILL SEE UP TO 8 INCHES, SO I-80, 50 WILL BE DIFFICULT TO TRAVEL. THIS IS IN AND AROUND THE SIERRA RANGE, SO PREPARE FOR THAT. YOU WILL DEAL WITH THAT THROUG THE WEEKEND. TODAY, ELSEWHERE WE HAVE SUNSHINE. ON THE EAST COAST WE HAVE COLDER CONDITION, THOUGH DON'T BE FOOLED BY THE BLU SKIES- WE HAVE CHILLY CONDITIONS THAT HAVE TAKEN SHAPE BY TOMORROW. RAIN IN THE SOUTHEAST STILL DEALING WIT SUNSHINE. IN THE WEST, TEMPERATURES WILL WARM UP TOUCH ACROSS THE MIDWEST GREA LAKES, NORTHERN PLAINS AND SOUTHERN PLAINS. WHERE YOU AR NOT DEALING WITH RAIN, TEMPERATURES WILL BE MILD OUT WEST OF COURSE IT IS TH SIERRA STORM THAT WE WILL KEEP TRACK OF THROUGH THE WEEKEND. WE FINISH THE WORK WEEK AND HEAD TO THE WEEKEND, WITH THE RAIN WORKING UP THE EAST COAST, THE SYSTEM WILL BE MOVING EAST AS WE GET THROUGH SATURDAY AND THEN RECORD HIGHS, JUST AS WE EXPECTED. JUST LIKE WE DEALT WITH EARLIE IN THE WEEK, WE WILL SEE TEMPERATURES BACK TO ABNORMAL LEVELS- 70 DEGREES FOR THE MIDDLE OF THE COUNTRY THIS TIME OF YEAR AS W GET INTO EARLY MARCH. THAT'S WHAT WE WILL GET. IT WILL FEEL LIKE SPRING AND LASTS.

YOUR POINT ABOUT HAMAS IS REALLY TROUBLING. THIS IS THE GENERATION THAT WE SAW A FEW MONTHS AGO. WAS SPREADING THE OSAMA BEEN LADEN LETTER AND THINKING THAT WAS SAGE COUNSEL FROM THE MASTER MIND. SO MAYBE WE SHOULD NOT B SURPRISED BUT LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT WHA HAMAS IS. IT IS A TERROR ORGANIZATION. THEIR CHARTER COMMITS THEM NOT TO ACHIEVING PEACE FOR PALESTINIANS BUT TO LITERALL COMMITTING GENOCIDE AGAINST TH JEWS. THAT'S WHAT IT SAID IN THE CHARTER KILLING JEWS. WHEREVER THEY ARE >>. YOU TALK ABOUT SOCIAL MEDIA, TIKTOK. SOME OF THAT INCLUDE CONSPIRACY THEORIES >> ABSOLUTELY. >>. WHAT ARE SOME OF THE THINGS YOU HAVE SEEN THAT ARE MOS CONCERNING? >>. THEY ARE CALLIN ANTI-SEMITISM, THE OLDEST HATRED. IT IS A CONSPORACY THEORY ABOU HOW THE WORLD WORKS. IN TODAY'S WORLD. WITH THE MEDI LANDSCAPE, CONSPIRACIES ARE TH POINT OF REALM.

WE ARE A FEW HOURS AWAY FROM POLLS CLOSING IN MICHIGAN, WHERE WE WILL GET OUR FIRST PREVIEW HOW VOTERS ARE FEELING IN WHAT COULD BE THE KEY SWING STATE IN NOVEMBER. PRESIDENT BIDEN FACING DOWN A PROTEST VOTE DEMOCRATS UPSET HOW HE HANDLED THE ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR, HOW THEY ARE DECIDING TO VOTE UNCOMMITTED. >>. WE VOTED UNCOMMITTED IT TO PUT THE PRESSURE ON THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION TO CALL FOR A CEASEFIRE SO THAT WE CAN SEE PEACE >>. I AM HOPING THAT IT WILL TELL THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY THAT THEY ARE MAKING TERRIBLE DECISIONS. >> THE POLICY SHOULD BE CHANGED 100%. >>. YOU HEARD FROM DEMOCRATS. THERE ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE, FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP TRYING TO KEEP UP HIS WINNING STREAK AGAINST WINLESS NIKKI HALEY BOTH CANDIDATES NOT BOTHERING TO TRAVEL TO MICHIGAN FOR PRIMARY NIGHT- TRUMP EXPECTED TO CRUISE THROUGH ANOTHER EASY VICTORY THERE. I WANT TO GET IN WITH SHAQUILLE BREWSTER. THE INTERESTING PART OF TONIGHT IS SO THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE, NOT THE REPUBLICAN SIDE. LET ME START THERE RIGHT. >>. THE THREAT TO BIDEN: THOUSANDS OF MAYBE TENS, OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE VOTING UNCOMMITTED. THIS IS A MESSAGING VOTE, TO BE CLEAR, RIGHT. NO REAL RISK THAT JOE BIDEN LOSES THE PRIMARY THERE. BUT IT IS A MESSAGE AS IT RELATES TO PARTYUNECASION. AS THEY HEAD INTO NOVEMBER, TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE EXPECTATIONS SETTING UP HERE >>. Reporter- YES. LET'S START WITH THE LISTEN TO MICHIGAN GROUP, THE GROUP THAT IS ORGANIZING TO GET PEOPLE TO VOTE UNCOMMITTED. THEY WANT THE GOAL TO HAVE 10,000 PEOPLE. DO THAT. WHEN YOU TALK TO OFFICIALS WITH THAT GROUP, THEY SAY THEY ARE TRYING TO SEND A MESSAGE CLEARLY THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE, MEMBERS OF HIS BASE, WHO HELPED HIM WIN AND HELPED HIM FLIP THE STATE BACK IN 2020, WHO ARE NO LONGER WITH HIM. THE NUMBER THAT THEY PUT ON THAT IT IS 10,000.. NOW YOU CAN TELL THAT THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN AT LEAST HAS BEEN WATCHING AND AT LEAST PAYING ATTENTION TO THIS. THERE ARE COUNTERMESSAGING COMING FROM THE CAMPAIGN. THEY ARE SAYING: WHEN YOU PUT IT IN FULL CONTEXT, THAT GOAL OF 10,000, IT IS NOT AS HIGH AND NOT AS SIGNIFICANT AS IT MIGHT APPEAR ON FIRST BLUSH. LOOK AT THE NUMBERS- THE PAST THREE CYCLES, THEY POINT OUT THEY HAVE HAD ABOUT 20,000 VOTERS VOTE UNCOMMITTED. THERE IS AN EXCEPTION: WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT PARTY DYNAMICS, THEY ARE AYING EVEN, THE GOAL EVEN, IF IT DOES HAPPEN, IT IS NOT AS IMPRESSIVE AS IT MAY APPEAR ON THE SURFACE. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE POLLING OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO SAY THEY ARE GOING TO BE VOTING UNCOMMITTED IN TODAY'S PRIMARY, WHEN THEY ARE ASKED WHO WILL THEY SUPPORT IN NOVEMBER IF IT COMES DOWN TO DONALD TRUMP AND JOE BIDEN, THEY HAVE A MAJORITY OF THEM SAYING THEY ARE GOING BACK TO BIDEN, A GOOD CHUNK OF THEM SAYING THEY WILL SUPPORT TRUMP AND THEN MANY OF THEM WHO ARE UNDECIDED. THEY ARE TRYING TO SET OFF WARNING FLAGS, SAYING WE ARE NOT HAPPY WITH YOUR CURRENT POLICY AND THAT YOU SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON GETTING OUR SUPPORT BACK >>. THAT IS GOING TO BE THE INTERESTING THING TO WATCH TONIGHT. WHAT IS THAT NUMBER OF UNCOMMITTED? WHAT DO THEY HIT? 10,000? 20,000? MORE? WHAT IS THE RESPONSE ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE INTERESTING EXPECTATION GAME AFOOT WHEN IT RELATES TO NIKKI HALEY, WHO IS PROMISING TO FIGHT ON THROUGH SUPER TUESDAY IN EARLY MARCH. HERE HER CAMPAIGN IS SUGGEST THAT PERHAPS EVEN 10% OF THE REPUBLICAN VOTE FOR NIKKI HALEY COULD BE A SIGNIFICANT WIN. HELP US UNDERSTAND THAT ON A LOT OF PLANETS. IT IS NOT A WIN. IT WOULD BE A DEFEAT IF IT WERE TO COME TO BE BE >>. AND YOU ADD INTO THE FACTOR THAT IN THE GOP PRIMARY, THE RULES BENEFIT SIGNIFICANTLY THE PERSON, THE CANDIDATE, WHO GETS MORE THAN 50%. THEY GET THE LARGEST SHARE OF VOTES. NOW THE RULES HERE IN MICHIGAN, OR DELEGATES I SHOULD SAY THEY GET MORE COMPLICATED. THERE IS DEFINITELY A MESSAGING BATTLE GOING ON AS WELL. NIKKI HALEY IS NOT IN THE STATE TODAY, AS YOU MENTIONED. SHE IS GOING AHEAD AND LOOKING FORWARD TO THE SUPER TUESDAY STATE. SHE STARTS A NINE DAY OR NINE STATE SWING INTO SUPER TUESDAY. I WANT YOU TO LISTEN TO SOME OF THE VOTERS THAT I HAVE BEEN TALKING TO. NIKKI HALEY WAS HERE YESTERDAY AND SOME OF THAT MESSAGING THAT SHE HAS BEEN ARTICULATING, HAS BEEN SEEPING DOWN TO THOSE CASTING THEIR BALLOTS. LISTEN HERE >>. I THINK SHE REPRESENTS A MORE REASONED VOICE, TIRED OF ALL OF THE NASTINESS HAVING TWO SOLID CANDIDATES IN THE FALL. I THINK IT IS MUCH BETTER THAN HAVING SOMEONE FACING THE CRIMINAL CHARGES. >>. Reporter THAT LAST GENTLEMAN SAID HE WOULD SUPPORT JOE BIDEN IN THE GENERAL ELECTION, BUT HE VOTED FOR NIKKI HALEY IN THE PRIMARY AS A WAY TO STOP TRUMP'S MOMENTUM. >>. WATCHING ALL OF THIS THERE, WE WILL CHECK BACK IN WITH YOU, SHAQ, THANK YOU. >>>. TO WASHINGTON NOW. A WORD TONIGHT. WE DON'T HEAR A LOT OF THESE DAYS WHEN IT COMES TO CONGRESS, GETTING STUFF DONE. OPTIMISM, YES, OPTIMISM, THAT IS THE WORD FOR NOW. PRESIDENT BIDEN, ALONGSIDE THE TOP 4 LEADERS, ONE CALLING AN INTENSE MEETING. THEY ALL SEEM TO AGREE. NO ONE WANTS A PARTIAL SHUTDOWN. THAT COULD START MIDNIGHT ON FRIDAY. >>. SHUTDOWN: DAMAGE THE ECONOMY SIGNIFICANTLY AND I THINK WE ALL AGREE TO THAT AND WE NEED BIPARTISAN SOLUTION >>. SO WHAT HAPPENS IN THERE WERE TO BE A PARTIAL GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN THIS WEEKEND. IT HITS FIRST THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY, THE VA HUD MARCH 8th NEXT WEEK. DEFENSE DEPARTMENTS, STATE DEPARTMENT ET CETERA. THEIR WORKERS AND THOUSANDS OF OTHERS FURLOUGHED THEY WOULD NOT GET PAID, BUT SOME OF THEM STILL HAVE TO COME TO WORK. CHUCK SCHUMER SAID THINGS GOT FEISTY WHEN MONEY FOR UKRAINE CAME UP WITH HOUSE SPEAKER JOHNSON >>. THE MEETING ON UKRAINE WAS ONE OF THE MOST INTENSE I HAVE EVER ENCOUNTERED IN MY MANY MEETINGS IN THE OVAL OFFICE. >>. LISTEN, HE HAD A LOT OF MEETINGS IN THE OVAL OFFICE. NOW LET'S START WITH THE SHUTDOWN. AT THE END OF THE DAY, NOBODY WANTS TO SHUTDOWN. HELP, HELP PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHAT THE HOLD UP IS TO PREVENT A SHUTDOWN THEN >>. Reporter HALLIE, IF IT FEELS LIKE DEJA VU, IT IS. WE ARE HAVE BEEN ON THE BRINK OF SHUTDOWN. SOME OF THE CASES NARROWLY AVOIDED AT THE LAST MINUTE. THAT IS WHY THE WHITE HOUSE WANTED TO CALL THE LEADERS HERE TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION, TO HOPEFULLY AVOID THIS AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN. BUT THERE IS SOMETIMES LITTLE AGREEMENT ON HOW EXACTLY TO GET FROM POINT A TO POINT B. IF EVERYONE AGREES, WE WANT TO GET TO POINT B AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THERE IS NO SHUTDOWN. THE WHITE HOUSE N TERMS OF THEIR READING. THEY SAID IT WOULD BE UNACCEPTABLE TO BE. HAVE ANY KIND OF A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN BECAUSE OF THE RAMIFICATIONS THAT YOU WERE LAYING OUT THERE IN THIS 2 TIERED PROCESS: PARTIAL ON FRIDAY AT MIDNIGHT IF IT HAPPENS BUT THEN IT WILL BE FULL A WEEK LATER. IN THE MIDDLE OF ALL OF THAT IS THE PRESIDENT'S STATE OF THE UNION. THERE IS A BIG TOPIC THAT IS LOOMING OVER A LOT OF THIS THAT WE ARE GOING TO SEE A LOT OF ATTENTION ON THIS WEEK. THAT IS FUNDING FOR THE SOUTHERN BORDER. PRESIDENT BIDEN WILL BE TRAVELING THERE. WE KNOW IT IS SOMETHING THAT THE HOUSE SPEAKER, MIKE JOHNSON, RAISED REPORTEDLY AS BEING CONNECTED TO SOME OF THESE PRIORITIES AND OTHER FUNDING DEADLINES THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO JUGGLE. EVERYONE HAS THEIR AGENDA TO WHAT THEY WANT TO ACCOMPLISH. THEY SAY THEY HAVE A SHARED GOAL. WE WILL SEE IF WE CAN GET THERE IN THE END >>>. THE OPTICS OF THIS ASIDE, SHOWING SOME OF THE VIDEO, IT IS INTERESTING HERE TO SEE HOUSE SPEAKER JOHNSON IN THE ROOM THERE WITH THE PRESIDENT, THE VICE PRESIDENT, THE LEADERS, AND YOU HEARD THE TOP SENATE DEMOCRAT COME OUT AND SAY: YEAH, IT WAS INTENSE WHEN IT CAME TO FUNDING FOR UKRAINE ADDITIONAL MONEY FROM THE US TO UKRAINE. JOHNSON MADE THAT A NONISSUE. DO WE KNOW ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT WHY THINGS GOT SO INTENSE IF THERE WERE FIREWORKS, WHAT IT WAS ABOUT >>. Reporter. WE HAVE A LITTLE WINDOW INTO IT. THAT IS PARTIALLY BECAUSE THE CIA DIRECTOR WAS IN THE MEETING AND HE GAVE A PRESENTATION ON THE IMPLICATIONS HERE. WITH LONG STORY, SHORT MEANS IN UKRAINE DOES NOT GET THIS PROPER FUNDING. THEY WILL LOSE THIS WAR. THAT WAS THE BOTTOM LINE. THAT IS WHY SENATOR SCHUMER SAID IT IS SOMETHING. THAT IS SO DIRE. IT NEEDS TO HAPPEN IN A MATTER OF WEEKS, OR THE CONSEQUENCES COULD BE DIRE HALLIE. >>. OUTSIDE OF THE WHITE HOUSE, THANKS >>> TO GEORGIA. TONIGHT DRAMATIC, TENSE, NEW TESTIMONY ON A KEY QUESTION RELATED TO THE INVESTIGATION AGAINST FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP. WHEN DID THE FULTON COUNTY DA DATING THE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR? YOU GOT THE JUDGE CALLING BRADLEY BACK TO THE STAND TRYING TO GET CLARITY HERE. THE EX-DIVORCE LAWYER FOR THAT EXPROSECUTOR, WHO WAS IN THE COURTROOM, THE LAWYER FOR ONE OF TRUMP'S CO-DEFENDANTS ASKING REPORTED QUESTIONS- THIS WENT ON FOR HOURS TO TRY TO FILL IN THIS TIME LINE HERE, RIGHT. WHEN DID THEY START DATING? BUT THE ATTORNEY BRADLEY SAID HE JUST CAN NOT SAY WATCH. >>. THERE WAS NOT A SPECIFIC DATE, THERE WAS NOT A FOOTBALL GAME, THERE WAS NOTHING THAT I CAN ATTRIBUTE TO HIM TELLING ME WHEREVER AT THIS TIME. I AM TELLING YOU THAT I DO NOT HAVE THE DATE. >>. OKAY, REMEMBER WHY THIS MATTERS. THE JUDGE HERE COULD KICK THE DA WILLOWS OFF OF THIS CASE OVER THE ALLEGATIONS FOR THE TRUMP TEAM SHE MAY OF BENEFITED FINANCIALLY AND INAPPROPRIATELY. THE TRUMP TEAM SAYS IT IS ALL ABOUT THE TIME LINE. THEY SAY THEY STARTED DATING IN EARLY 2022. AFTER SHE HIRED HIM, ONE EVER- THE FORMER FRIENDS SAID NO, IT STARTED BACK IN 2019.. WHAT WE ARE STILL NOT GETTING HERE, WHAT WE HAVE NOT SEEN TOUCHED, IS ANY DIRECT EVIDENCE THAT THE DA FINANCIALLY BENEFITED FROM THIS RELATIONSHIP, WHICH IS THE CRUX OF THE ALLEGATION AGAINST IT FAIR >>. IT IS NOT ONLY FAIR BUT I AM GLAD YOU ARE BRINGING IT UP. IT REALLY SHOULD BE THE REASON WHY A DISQUALIFICATION SHOULD HAPPEN. IF THERE IS A CONFLICT OF INTEREST BECAUSE SHE INITIALLY PUT WADE IN THE JOB HER THEN BOYFRIEND, THEY ARE NOT DATING ANY MORE. SHE IS NOT CONTINUING TO GET A FINANCIAL BENEFIT BUT IF SHE DID IT TO GET THIS PERSONAL BENEFIT, THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE RIGHT. YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE A PROSECUTOR TRYING TO DO A MONEY GRAB BECAUSE HER BOYFRIEND HAS THIS JOB. BUT THIS HEARING VEERED OFF COURSE AND ENTERED INTO A SIDESHOW WHEN THEY BEGAN DATING. BUT I AM NOT GOING TO BE FLIPPANT ABOUT IT. IT IS RELEVANT IF PERJURY HAS BEEN COMMITTED. DID THEY LIE ABOUT WHEN THAT RELATIONSHIP BEGAN? THEN THAT DOES SPEAK TO THE DEFENSE'S THEORY THAT WILLIS MADE OF HAD MOTIVATION TO PUT HER BOYFRIEND INTO A CUSH JOB. REMEMBER, BRADLEY WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE STAR WITNESS FOR THE DEFENSE. WHEN HE TOOK THE STAND TWO WEEKS AGO, HE OFFERED LIMITED TESTIMONY. TODAY WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A HUGE BLOCKBUSTER EVENT AND TAKE A QUICK LISTEN AS TO SPECIFICALLY WHAT HE HAD TO SAY ABOUT WHY HE SHARED ANY INFORMATION ABOUT HIS FORMER CLIENT WITH THE LAWYER. >> NO ONE TOLD ME I WAS SPECULATING. >> NO ONE TOLD YOU THAT. >> NO ONE TOLD ME THAT. >> WAS IT SPECULATION? WHEN YOU TOLD ME THAT, WAS IT BASED ON THINGS THAT HAD BEEN TOLD TO YOU? >> I NEVER WITNESSED ANYTHING. >> SPECULATION. I NEVER WITNESSED ANYTHING. HALLIE, THAT IS NOT EVIDENCE. IN THE ABSENCE OF EVIDENCE, THE JUDGE MAY NOT HAVE ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO DISQUALIFY WILLIS. >>. WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THIS HAS BEEN. WE HAVE SEEN SOME REAL INTENSE MOMENTS THROUGH THE COURSE OF THE WHOLE DISCUSSION. YOU KNOW THESE QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS RELATIONSHIP. WILLIS REMEMBER WHEN SHE TOOK THE STAND. LET ME REMIND PEOPLE WHAT THAT MOMENT WAS LIKE. >>. THESE PEOPLE ARE ON TRIAL FOR TRYING TO STEAL AN ELECTION IN 2020.. I AM NOT ON TRIAL, NO, MATTER HOW HARD YOU TRY TO PUT ME ON TRIAL. WHAT YOU ARE REALLY ASKING ABOUT? I THINK HE LIED. RIGHT HERE, RIGHT HERE, NO, NO, THERE IS THE TRUTH. RIGHT HERE. THEY LIE. >> FIRED UP ABOUT THIS AND PART OF THIS. SHE LAID IT OUT. HERE ARE THE STAKES OF WHAT IS AT PLAY: THIS ELECTION INTERFERENCE CASE AGAINST FORMER TRUMP- BIG PICTURE HERE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE WATCHING THAT ARE NOT TUNED INTO THE INS AND OUTS. HERE IS WHAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW RELATED TO THIS RELATIONSHIP THAT SHE HAD COULD IT DERAIL THE ENTIRE CASE. >>. YES, BECAUSE IN THE STATE OF GEORGIA, IF A PROSECUTOR IS DISQUALIFIED, THE ENTIRE OFFICE OF THAT IS DISQUALIFIED AND THE CASE GETS KICKED OFF TO A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR WHO WILL DECIDE WHAT NEW OFFICE WILL TAKE IT, WHAT NEW OFFICE GETS IT, BECAUSE IT COULD TAKE A LONG TIME, THE NEW OFFICE COULD DECIDE NOT TO PURSUE ALL OF THE CHARGES THAT FANI WILLIS OBTAINED FROM A GRAND JURY WHO KNOWS WHAT COULD HAPPEN TO THAT HUGE RICO COULDN'T THAT TRUMP IS FACING BUT ALL OF THE OTHER REMAINING DEFENDANTS. >>. ANY TIME LINE WHEN WE WILL KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS, WHEN THE JUDGE WILL MAKE THIS DECISION. >>. QUICKLY, SUMMATIONS ARE ON FRIDAY AT 1:00,. WE SHOULD GET A WRITTEN ORDER WITHIN THE NEXT 7-, 10 DAYS. >>. WOW, LOTS TO WATCH OVER THE COURSE OF THIS MONTH. KATIE PHANG, APPRECIATE YOU BEING WITH US. >>>. HAMAS, ISRAEL BOTH POURING COLD WATER ON THE SURPRISE COMMENTS FROM PRESIDENT BIDEN SUGGESTING A CEASEFIRE COULD HAPPEN AS SOON AS MONDAY REMEMBER, WHEN HE SAID THAT, AT THE ICE CREAM SHOP WITH SETH MEYERS, WE BROUGHT IT TO YOU AS BREAKING NEWS 24 HOURS. NOW IT DOES NOT SEEM LIKE. ISRAELI IS SO THE SAME PAGE, THEY SAID. THEY DID NOT KNOW. PRESIDENT BIDEN WAS GOING TO SAY THAT HAMAS IS GIVING THE SAME MESSAGE HERE TOO >>. NOW WE ARE LIVE IN TEL AVIV. WHAT IS UP WITH THIS WHIPLASH? THE PRESIDENT CAME OUT, YOU KNOW, IN THIS CASUAL SETTING, SAYING YEAH, MAYBE THIS WEEKEND, BY NEXT MONDAY, I AM HOPEFUL- COME OVER SEAS, BOTH SIDES- ISRAEL, HAMAS, DISMISSIVE QUICKLY. WHERE DO THINGS STAND? >>. ISRAEL AND HAMAS DON'T AGREE ON VERY MUCH. THEY SEEM TO BE ON THE SAME PAGE ON THIS MONDAY DEADLINE THAT THE PRESIDENT MENTIONED IN THE ICE CREAM SHOP IN NEW YORK CITY. IT IS NEWS TO THEM. ISRAELI OFFICIALS WERE SURPRISED. THEY DID NOT GET ANY HEAD'S UP FROM THE WHITE HOUSE THAT THIS WAS A DEADLINE, A GOAL, AN ASPIRATION THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN WAS GOING TO BE SETTING. WE DID HEAR A STATEMENT FROM PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: EARLIER, TONIGHT, HE MADE ABSOLUTELY NO MENTION OF A DEAL AND INSTEAD. HE SAYS HE BELIEVES HE HAS ENOUGH SUPPORT TO CONTINUE HIS MILITARY CAMPAIGN INSIDE OF GAZA. FROM HAMAS'S PERSPECTIVE. HAMAS'S PERSPECTIVE. THEY HAMAS PERSPECTIVE. THEY ARE CALLING HIM A HYPOCRITE. THEY ARE SAYING: AT THIS POINT, ANY TALK OF A DEAL IS PREMATURE. WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT THE NEGOTIATIONS, AT THIS POINT, ARE FOCUSED ON A PROPOSAL LAID OUT BY CIA DIRECTOR BILL BURNES. IT INVOLVES A PAUSE IN RIGHTING UP TO SIX WEEKS THUNDER DEAL. HAMAS WOULD RELEASE 40 HOSTAGES, INCLUDING WOMEN WHO WERE SUPPOSED TO COME OUT IN THE LAST DEAL BACK IN NOVEMBER. IN RETURN, ISRAEL EXPECTED TO RELEASE HUNDREDS OF PALESTINIAN PRISONERS, POTENTIALLY INCLUDING SOME WHO ARE SERVING LONG JAIL SENTENCES FOR MURDER, FOR TERRORISM, FOR OTHER SERIOUS OFFENSES BUT BOTH SIDES ARE SAYING: THERE ARE MAJOR CAPS STILL OUTSTANDING ONE OF THE BIG QUESTIONS. WHAT ONE OF THE BIG QUESTIONS? WHAT, EXACTLY, IS THE RATIO OF PRISONER? EXACTLY, IS THE RATIO OF PRISONER, PRISONERS AND HOSTAGES? WITH THEY WITHDRAWAL, THEY ARE SAYING: THAT IS A NONSTARTER. >> THANK YOU. >>> COMING UP. WHY PRINCE WILLIAM SUDDENLY PULLED OUT OF A SERVICE FOR HIS GOD FATHER. AND WHAT THE PALACE IS SAYING ALL ABOUT THE KATE MIDDLETON HEALTH RUMORS. >>> GOOGLE'S PLAN TO BRING BACK THE AI GENERATOR. AFTER IT, >> WHAT WAS IT LIKE GETTING THAT? >> STREAMING NOW. >>> LATE TODAY, A NEW BILL HAS BEGUN WORKING ITS WAY THROUGH ALABAMA THAT PROTECTS IVF10 DAYS. AFTER THAT COURT RULING THERE SAYING FROZEN EMBRYOS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED. PEOPLE F? IT SEEMS LIKE THINGS HAVE BEEN HAPPENING IN LIGHTNING SPEED IN ALABAMA. THIS IS NOT ON THE STATE HOUSE RADAR A WEEK AGO. LOOK AT THIS: THE COURT RULING. THEY CAME DOWN, COMES DOWN. FEBRUARY 16th, WITH THE FIRST CLINIC SUSPENDING IVF TREATMENT ON FEBRUARY 21st, TWO MORE FOLLOWED. LAST FRIDAY DEMOCRATS INTRODUCED A BILL TO PROTECT IVF. OVER THE WEEKEND, THE EXPLOSIVE DETONATED AT THE AG'S OFFICE. ALABAMA LAW ENFORCEMENT IS INVESTIGATING THAT. TWO BILLS INTRODUCED IN THE SENATE, BOTH BY REPUBLICANS. ALL OF THIS HAPPENING AS THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION HEALTH OFFICIAL IS MEETING TODAY WITH FAMILIES AND DOCTORS IN ALABAMA WHO SAY THEIR LIVES AND PRACTICES HAVE BEEN THROWN INTO CHAOS BY THIS COURT RULING. ALL OF THIS HIGHLIGHTS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ISSUE OF REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS IN A PRESIDENTIAL YEAR >>. WE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WHAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO DO, TO TRY TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF PEOPLE WHO WANT TO ACCESS THEIR HEALTH CARE RIGHTS. WHEN ROE WENT DOWN AND TOOK AWAY HEALTH CARE RIGHTS, TOOK AWAY HEALTH CARE RIGHTS AND ACCESS IT, DID IT TO MORE THAN JUST ABORTION CARE >>. KATHY, IT SHOWS THE WAY. THIS IS SUCH A BIG DEAL, NOT JUST IN ALABAMA BUT NATIONALLY AS WELL, I KNOW YOU HAVE BEEN TALKING TO FAMILIES TODAY. WALK US THROUGH WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN HEARING >>. HEY THERE, HALLIE, THAT IS RIGHT. IT HAS BEEN A ROLLER COASTER OF AN EMOTION FOR THEM TACKLING IVF AND THEN POTENTIAL EMBRYO TRANSFER. AND THEN THEY TELL ME IT REALLY HAS BEEN A GUT PUNCH WHEN THE RULING CAME DOWN. THE RIPPLE EFFECT HAS BEEN PRETTY QUICK AND THE BACKLASH AS BEEN QUICK, AS BEEN QUICK. WE SAW MOVEMENT. TODAY, AS YOU MENTIONED, TWO REPUBLICANS HAVE INTRODUCED LEGISLATION TO PRESERVE IVF AND LAST WEEK WE HAD A SIMILAR BILL. THAT WAS INTRODUCED BY THE DEMOCRATIC HOUSE MINORITY LEADER, ANTHONY DANIELS. BUT REALLY, HALLIE, IVF. I WAS TOLD TIME AND TIME AGAIN: TIMING IS EVERYTHING AND HAVING TO DEAL WITH THIS ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE HAS BEEN EXTREMELY CHALLENGING. YOU MENTIONED THE TOP HEALTH OFFICIAL WAS IN TOWN HERE IN BIRMINGHAM HAVING A ROUND TABLE WITH IVF PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS GOING THROUGH THEIR STORIES, THEIR STRUGGLES. AND JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO, ACTUALLY A MOMENT AGO, WE SPOKE TO HANNAH MILES AND SHE IS ALSO AN IVF PATIENT AND HAS AN EMBRYO TRANSFER HAPPENING IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS. SHE SAYS: EVERYTHING IS UP IN THE AIR AT THIS POINT. TAKE A LISTEN. >>. WE, MORE THAN ANYONE, KNOW THAT AN EMBRYO DOES NOT EQUAL A CHILD, BECAUSE IF IT DID, I WOULD BE PREGNANT. >>. THE EMBRYO THAT WE WANT TO BE DESPERATELY TO BE A CHILD [CRYING] >>. IT NEVER WILL BE. >>. Reporter HALLIE, TO ADD TO THE CONVERSATION THAT I JUST HAD: SHE SAID THE FINANCIAL TOLL HAS BEEN GREAT. SHE SPENT $40,000 OUT-OF-POCKET AND THIS TRANSFER THAT IS COMING UP. SHE DOES NOT KNOW IF IT IS GOING TO MOVE FORWARD F, IT DOES. SHE DOES NOT KNOW IF IT WILL STICK A GAMBLE. SHE IS TAKING ONE OF THOUSANDS HERE IN THE STATE DEALING WITH THE SAME THING. TOMORROW WE WILL BE HEARING THEIR COLLECTIVE VOICES AT THE STATE CAPITOL IN GON, MONTGOMERY, ALABAMA. THEY PLAN ON SPENDING A MESSAGE THAT SOMETHING HAS TO CHANGE. THEY ARE HELD HOSTAGE AND THEY ARE SAYING: THIS RULING IS DOING THE SAME THING. >>. THANK YOU FOR BEING THERE AND BRINGING US THAT REPORTING. APPRECIATE IT. >>>. LET'S GET YOU OVER TO THE FIVE THINGS OUR TEAM THINKS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT TONIGHT NUMBER ONE. TWO MEN CONVICTED IN THE MURDER- CONVICTED OF MURDER- RATHER OF JAM MASTER J FROM RUN DMC. THEY KILLED HIM IN A DRUG DEAL IN 2002.. >>>. BUSINESS HEADLINES: SONY IS LAYING OFF PEOPLE. MACY'S IS CLOSING 150 STORES OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS, INCLUDING THE FLAGSHIP IN SAN FRANCISCO. ACCORDING TO CNBC, THEY WILL FOCUS ON THE BLOOMINGDALE AND FOUR EYE OINTMENTS ARE BEING RECALLED. THIS IS AFTER THOSE EYE DROP RECALLS THAT MADE SO MANY HEADLINES FOR MAKING SOME PEOPLE BLIND. NOW OINTMENT TOO. THE FDA SAYS IT IS WORRIED HOW STERILE THINGS ARE IN THE FACILITY. PEOPLE CAN END UP WITH EYE INFECTIONS. THE COMPANY HAS NOT HEARD OF PROBLEMS SO FAR. >>>. PRINCE WILLIAM PULLED OUT OF THE MEMORIAL SERVICE FOR HIS GOD FATHER, WHY? THE PALACE SAYS IT IS A PERSONAL MATTER. DID NOT SAY MUCH ELSE ON WHAT THAT PERSONAL MATTER WAS. PRINCESS KATE IS STILL DOING WELL AS SHE RECOVERS AFTER RUMORS OF HER BEING ON A COMA. THE PALACE PUSHED BACK ON THAT, CALLING IT LUDICROUS. A BOX OF HOCKEY CARDS WENT FOR $3.4 MILLION. 48 PACKS OF HOCKEY CARDS, POTENTIALLY WAYNE GET GRETZI. THE BOX IS MORE RARE THAN THE CARDS. HOW ABOUT THIS ONE FLEX PRICING FOR A FROSTY SURGE PRICING LIKE UBER BUT AT THE DRIVE-THRU, WENDYS WILL BE CHANGING PRICES. HOW DEMAND? THEY ARE THE TIMING. THE WEATHER COULD PLAY A PART IN IT. WE HAVE MORE ON THIS. WENDYS IS CALLING THIS EXPERIMENT WITH AI SUGGESTIVE SELLING. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS, DO YOU? >> THEY WILL UP SELL WHEREVER THEY CAN. CONSUMERS ARE USED TO THIS FROM TICKET MASTER AND UBER FOR PRODUCTS IN HIGH DEMAND FAST FOOD. THERE ARE OTHER CHOICES BUT WENDY'S IS SEEING WHAT OTHER INDUSTRIES AND COMPANIES WITHIN THE FAST FOOD SPACE THAT ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. WHEN THEY CAN UP SELL ITEMS, RAISE THE PRICE ON THINGS AND LOWER PRICES ON SOME THINGS THAT ARE NOT SELLING WELL, THAT SUGGESTIVE SELLING WE ARE USED TO WITH OTHER INDUSTRIES. WE WILL HAVE TO GET USED TO IT IN FAST FOOD. IT IS AN EXPERIMENT THEY ARE GOING TO DO IN 2025.. YOU WILL EXPECT OTHERS TO FOLLOW TOO. >> CAN WE? I WONDER ABOUT SHOPPER BACKLASH. IT IS NOT AS THOUGH. THEY HAVE A LOCK ON THE FAST FOOD MARKET. FOLKS HAVE A LOT OF CHOICES >> THEY DO. IF YOU ARE A BACONATOR FAN OR FROSTY, YOU WILL STICK WITH IT. BUT ONE THING TO CONSIDER IS WENDY'S LIKE A LOT OF OTHER CHAINS RELIES ON THE FRANCHISES. THEY HAVE 6800 RESTAURANTS, 86% OF OWNED BY SMALL BUSINESSES. THEY WILL HAVE TO FOLLOW SUIT. THEY CAN FACE THE BACKLASH AS WELL. FOOD PRICES HAVE BEEN HIGH. DINING OUT, ESPECIALLY FAST FOOD. IT HAS GONE UP 20% SINCE PREPANDEMIC. HIGHER PRICES WILL HANG ON CONSUMERS. YOU ARE RIGHT. THEY HAVE CHOICES AND THEY ARE ABOUT 20-30 FEET AWAY AT ANOTHER RESTAURANT. >> WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE IN PRICING: A BURGER IS $3.69.. WHATEVER ARE WE SAYING IT CAN GO UP TO. THAT IS THE AVERAGE PRICE. FRENCH FRIES: $1.79.. WOULD WE SEE A $10 FROSTY OR 10 CENT FROSTY? WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR THE DOLLARS AND CENTS? >>. IT DEPENDS TIME OF DAY, LUNCHTIME, CROWD. YOU CAN SEE THEM SURGE FOR THAT DAVE'S DOUBLE TO $1 OR $2 MORE. THEY ARE NOT BEING SPECIFIC BUT THE POINT IS TO USE AI DIGITAL MENUS TO SEE WHERE THE DEMAND IS. THIS IS COMMON WITH McDONALD'S. WENDY'S IS TRYING TO GET INTO IT AS WELL TO MANAGE THEIR INVENTORY BETTER UP, SELL THE THINGS NOT SELLING WELL AND CHARGE MORE FOR THE THINGS THAT ARE CONSUMERS. THIS WILL NOT FEEL GOOD. FOLKS THAT ARE SHOPPING AND EATING AT WENDY'S. THEY ARE ON A BUDGET >>. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT. WE WILL SEE, WE WILL SEE >>>. TONIGHT, GOOGLE SAYS THEY WILL RELAUNCH THE GEMENI AI AFTER CRITICISM. IT WAS TOO WOKE PUTTING IN PROMPTS FOR SOUNDING FATHERS, IMAGES OF PEOPLE OF COLOR LIKE THERE BLOWING UP ON LINE. YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE RESPONSES. WHO HAS DONE MORE HARM? LIBERTARIAN OR STOLAN? >>. IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY WHICH IDEOLOGY HAS DONE MORE HARM. GOOGLE, ALREADY APOLOGIZED, SAYING THEY MISSED THE MARK ON THIS. THEY ARE GOING TO RELAUNCH IT. THEY ARE GOING TO RELAUNCH IT. TALK ABOUT WHAT THIS COST GOOGLE, THIS CONTROVERSY >>.

THE AI MODEL BY GOOGLE IS REFLECTING WHAT HE CALLED THE CULTURAL ORTHODOX THAT PRO VADES SILICONE VALLEY, A LOT OF POLITICS BUT IT IS COSTING GOOGLE BILLIONS. YESTERDAY THE STOCK WAS DOWN: 4% A COUPLE, ALMOST A TRILLION, THE RISK A BIG NUMBER. IT IS A TOUGH WEEK FOR THIS COMPANY >>. WELL, THEY ARE FINDING THEMSELVES IN A PLACE THAT A LOT OF BUSINESSES POTENTIALLY FIND UNCOMFORTABLE. WE HAVE SEEN IT IN THE PAST. THAT IS IN THE CROSS HAIRS OF THE CULTURAL WARS. MORE BROODILY >>. ABSOLUTELY, ABSOLUTELY, ESPECIALLY FOR SILICONE VALLEY. AI ENGINEERS DON'T WANT TO GET CAUGHT UP IN THIS DISCUSSION AND POLITICAL DEBATE. AI AND ENGINEERING TALENT- IT IS SO HARD TO COME BY RIGHT NOW. THAT IS POTENTIAL IMPLICATION GOING FORWARD WILL. THEY HAVE TROUBLE RECRUITING PEOPLE IF THEY ARE SEEING BIAS, IN SOME WAY THEY DISABLED THE IMAGE GENERATION TOOL. THEY ARE SAYING WE MISSED THE MARK INACCURATE IT CALLS INTO QUESTION HOW IT HAPPENS?

THE DRUG GANGS HAVE BEEN DRIVING TERRORISTS. SECURITY FORCES- PRETTY MUCH DO. WHATEVER THEY WANT, SWARMING THROUGH APARTMENT BLOCKS, FORCING THEIR WA INSIDE FOR SOME. IT IS CLEARLY TERRIFYING A PLAN AND HIS CHILDREN COWER ON THE FLOOR AS THEY ARE STORMING IN TELLING THEM TO STAY WHERE THEY ARE. THEY HAVE DONE NOTHING WRONG, INDEED. NOBODY WAS ARRESTED IN THIS SWEEP >>. THE POLICE ARE GOING HOUSE TO HOUSE, DOOR TO DOOR, BANGING INTO APARTMENTS BUT PEOPLE ARE VERY UNHAPPY ABOUT WHAT THEY FEEL: INVASION OF THEIR PRIVACY. THEY SAY THEY GOT TO LOOK FOR DRUGS AND GANG MEMBERS WHEREVER THEY WANT TO. PEOPLE OUTSIDE ARE UNHAPPY. PEOPLE IN HERE ARE UNHAPPY TOO TOO >>. OUTSIDE, YOUNG MEN ARE HELD WITH HANDS ABOVE THEIR HEAD. THEIR FAMILIES START OBJECTING. IT IS TENSE. THE POLICE ARE UNCOMPROMISED. >>. WE ALL HAVE MOTHERS. THEY ARE MY CHILDREN. THEY ARE FAMILY. ALL OF THEM, NO ONE HERE IS.

APPRECIATE YOU BEING WITH US. >>> COMING UP HERE ON THE SHOW WHY AGENTS WANT NFL PROSPECTS TO SKIP ONE OF THE THINGS THEY USE TO CHECK THEM OUT FOR THE DRAFT: THE BIG STAR SAYING IT IS NOT WORTH IT. THE MIND GAMES COMING UP: >>>. WE KNOW THE SUPER BOWL JUST. >>>. WE KNOW THE SUPER BOWL JUST HAPPENED BUT ALREADY THE NEXT SEASON IS IN SWING BY NOW. WHY? BECAUSE OF THE NFL COMBINE. THAT IS WHEN THE GUYS THAT WANT. THAT IS WHEN THE GUYS THAT WANT TO BE DRAFTED AT THE END OF APRIL. >>> TWO BIG NAMED AGENTS TELLING THE PLAYERS DO NOT TAKE THE COGNATIVE TEST. THE COGNATIVE TEST: A SCORE WAS LEAKED LAST YEAR, WINNING THE LEAGUE'S AWARD, LEADING THE TEAM TO TH PLAYOFFS. THE NFL HAS DONE THIS TEST, THIS TEST FOR YEARS. NOW ACCUSATIONS- THEY HAVE A RACIAL BIAS- THESE TESTS. IS THIS NEW ONE SUPPOSED TO CUT IT OUT? YOU NOW HAVE AGAIN A BLACK ATHLETE WITH WHISPERS ABOUT HOW SMART HE IS. >>. EXPERTS HAVE SAID A LOT OF THINGS ABOUT THE TEST. THE OLD TEST THAT EXISTED AS ONE THAT IS USED WIDELY, NOT JUST FOR FOOTBALL PLAYERS BUT ALSO FOR COMPANIES TO TRY TO EVALUATE THABILITY. THIS IS A TEST USED FOR A LONG TIME. SO THE NEW TEST THAT IS BEING -- EVALUATE THAT ABILITY? THIS IS A TEST USED FOR A LONG TIME. SO THE NEW TEST THIS IS BEING USED. IT IS A SPECIFIC TEST: REACTION TIME, SPEED, HOW THEY REACT UNDER STRESS. THESE THINGS ARE DIFFERENT. THAT IS WHY THEY HAVE BEEN REPLACING THE TEST WITH THE F2 TEST, THE OLD ONES NOT USED BY THE NFL. SO THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS THAT ARE BEING LOOKED AT AND HOW THEY DO THE TEST. THE FIRST TEST IS A TEST THAT TAKES 12 MINUTES, A SERIES OF QUESTION THAT HAVE TO BE ANSWERED. IT LOOKED AT MATH AND VOCABULARY. THAT WAS THE OLD ONE. THE NEW ONE USES TECHNOLOGY FOR PLAYERS TO KEEP TRACK OF OBJECTS FOR A QUARTERBACK. IT CAN TEST THEIR ABILITY THAT THE QUARTERBACK CAN LOOK AT AN OBJECT OR A FEW OBJECTS. THAT IS SOMETHING THEY DO WHEN THEY ARE DOING ON THE FIELD, THE PLAYERS COMING AGAINST THEM AND THROWING THE BALL TO THESE ARE THE ARGUMENT THAT HAVE BEEN MADE BY THOSE THAT CREATED THE TEST, AND THAT IS WHY HALF OF THE TEAMS IN THE NFL ARE USING THAT TEST TO EVALUATE THE QUARTERBACK REMEMBER. THESE ARE TEAMS HALLIE INVESTING A LOT OF MONEY WHEN THEY DRAFT A PLAYER. THAT IS WHY THEY BROUGHT IN THE SECOND TEST, THE F2, THAT IS WHY IT IS SO POPULAR. >>. OKAY, BUT SO YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE RATIONAL. TO USE IT FOR QUARTERBACKS, RIGHT. YOU GOT OTHERS LIKE. FOR EXAMPLE, SOME OF THE AGENCIES SAYING IT IS NOT RIGHT FOR APTITUDE TO BE PART OF RIDICULE. NO OTHER JOB INTERVIEW CARRIES THAT SCRUTINY. WHAT IF MY TEST SCORES LEAKED? AND HOW WOULD I FEEL ABOUT THAT? STROUD STILL A GREAT PLAYER? >>. Reporter. CORRECT ATHLETES FIRST. THE AGENCY THAT IS ADVISING THEM NOT TO TAKE THE TEST BROUGHT IT UP. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE QUARTERBACK, WHAT HAPPENED WHEN LAST YEAR OR TWO YEARS AGO, STROUD TOOK THE TEST? ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH HIS TEST IS THAT THE INFORMATION WAS LEAKED. THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE PRIVATE INFORMATION. THE COMPANY DOES THE TEST AND THAT INFORMATION IS DELIVERED TO THE TEAMS. BUT THE INFORMATION WAS LEAKED, THEN THAT, OF COURSE, EFFECTED THE PLAYER. FOR NOW WE HAVE THESE AGENTS WHO ARE ADVISING THE PLAYERS NOT TO TAKE THOSE COGNITIVE TESTS. THEN YOU LOOK AT THE OTHER SIDE, OTHER QUARTERBACKS LIKE BROCK, PURDY, PATRICK MAHOMES- SOME OF THE BEST QUARTERBACKS IN THE NFL THAT TESTED VERY WELL IN THE TEST. NOW HERE IS WHAT IS DIFFICULT, BECAUSE WE CAN NOT GO ON A SERVER AND SEE HOW EVERYONE SCORED. BUT SOME INFORMATION HAS BEEN LEAKED WHERE WE KNOW WHICH QUARTERBACKS DID WELL AND SOME THAT DID NOT. THERE IS SAN ARGUMENT FOR THOSE THAT TESTED VERY WELL, WHO ARE NOW DOING WELL IN THE LEAGUE. I THINK WHAT WE SHOULD LOOK AT HERE, MOVING FORWARD HALLIE. THIS IS A TEST THAT WORKED FOR SOME TEAMS, BUT THE STROUD INCIDENT SAYING SOMEONE THAT DOES NOT TEST WELL, HE CAN CLEARLY HAVE A GOOD YEAR. LIKE HE DID >>. HE DEFINITELY DID. >>>. IN THE LAST COUPLE OF MINUTES, ONE OF THE BIGGEST CITIES IN THE COUNTRY FORMALLY: >> ALL RIGHT >>, LOVE THIS >>>. SO, IN THE LAST COUPLE MINUTES, TONIGHT, THE SAN FRANCISCO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS VOTED TO FORMALLY A APOLOGIZE TO THE BLACK RESIDENTS AND THEIR DESCENDANTS FOR DECADES OF RACIST LAWS AND POLICIES BY THE CITY LISTEN >> THE NAMES ON THE ROSTER: THIS RESOLUTION IS APPROVED. SAME HOUSE, SAME CALL. THE RESOLUTION IS ADOPTED UNANIMOUSLY >>. SAN FRANCISCO IS NOW ONE OF THE FIRST BIG CITIES TO DO THIS. THEY ARE CONSIDERING PROVIDING REPARATIONS. WHILE SOME SAY IT SAY MAJOR STEP, OTHERS ARGUE AN APOLOGY ALONE IS SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH. WE HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THIS STORY JOINING US NOW, TALK US THROUGH THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE APOLOGY AND CRITICISMS WHAT IS NEXT? >>. Reporter. THIS APOLOGY IS THE FIRST STEP. AFTER ABOUT 100 PROPOSALS IN SAN FRANCISCO AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE ARE CELEBRATING AS A GREAT FIRST STEP. THERE IS A LOT OF PUSH BACK FROM THE BLACK COMPLEUN NIT, SAN FRANCISCO: 46,000 PEOPLE IN THAT POPULATION. FIRST, I WANT YOU TO HEAR SOME OF THE REACTION FROM ONE OF THE SUPERVISORS, AS THE VOTE JUST PASSED: >> WE HAVE MUCH MORE WORK TO DO AND THIS IS A FIRST STEP >>. SO SAN FRANCISCO IS APOLOGIZING AND MAKING A PROMISE AND A COMMITMENT TO NEVER REPEAT THE RACIST LAWS AGAIN, WHILE WORKING TOWARDS, SOLVING AND IMPROVING STEMMATIC RACISM. THE CRITICISM IS COMING FROM SOME IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY SAYING IT IS COTTON, CANDY, RHETORIC, AND THEY PROPOSED, AND HAVE OVER THE LAST YEAR, PROPOSED, ALTERNATE REPARATIONS, AS THEY PROPOSED EVERY ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A $5,000 LUMP SUM CASH PAYMENT. THERE IS PUSH BACK FROM THE MAYOR OF SAN FRANCISCO. THE MAYOR OF SAN FRANCISCO. WHO THE MAYOR OF SAN FRANCISCO, WHO HERSELF IS BLACK. SHE BELIEVES THAT SHOULD BE HANDLED AT A NATIONAL LEVEL, ALSO BECAUSE OF A BUDGET CRUNC- $4 MILLION IN THEIR BUDGET THEY HAD PUT TOGETHER THIS VOTE JUST HAPPENED. WE WILL SEE MORE REACTION COMING IN BROADLY. THE CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATURE -- IT WOULD KIND OF TACKLE SOME PROPERTY ISSUES. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD. THAT IS IT FOR THIS AREA. WE GOT MORE COVERAGE PICKING UP RIGHT NOW. RIGHT NOW. SAW MATT -- â™ª â™ª. >>>. TONIGHT, A REAL RISK FOR DANGEROUS MAYBE, EVEN DEADLY WEATHER, FOR MILLIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. A DOZEN FEET OF SNOW PREDICTED FOR ONE AREA, WITH TORNADOES AND HAIL HEADING FOR ANOTHER. WE WALK YOU THROUGH ALL OF THAT FOR JUST A SECOND. IN MICHIGAN, WHERE POLLS ARE SET TO BEGIN IN JUST A COUPLE OF HOURS, THE PROCESS VOTE IN THE WAR IN GAZA. IT COULD BE TROUBLE AHEAD FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN WHEN VOTERS ARE SAYING ABOUT WHERE THIS GOES. IN NOVEMBER >>> MORE DRAMATIC TESTIMONY IN GEORGIA: THE TIMELINE OF WHEN THE DA STARTED DATING THE PROSECUTOR SHE PICKED TO HELP LEAD THE CASE AGAINST FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. WHAT A KEY WITNESS. IS NOW SANK IN COURT >>> WHY ISRAEL AND HAMAS ARE PUMPING THE BRAKES. THE CEASE- FIRE COULD COME IN LESS THAN A WEEK -- GOOGLE IS TRYING TO FIX WHEN IT MAY BE READY TO BE USED AGAIN. HEY THERE I AM HAILLE. WE ARE ON HIGH ALERT FOR INTENSE WEATHER ACROSS THE MIDWEST SEVERAL STATES UNDER AN ACTIVE TORNADO WATCH. AS WE SPEAK, THIS IS NEW COMING IN THE LAST 60 MINUTES. THIS IS ALL PART OF THE WEATHER WHIPLASH WE'VE BEEN TELLING YOU ABOUT. IN TEXAS YOU CAN SEE THE SMOKE IN THE SKY FROM FIRES BURNING THROUGH HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ACRES. IT IS NOT AT ALL CONTAINED A DISASTER DECLARATION IN DOZENS OF COUNTIES ISSUED BY THE GOVERNOR LATE TONIGHT IN NEW YORK. THESE ARE THE HAZY SKIES TODAY FROM WILDFIRE SMOKE DOWNTOWN LOOK AT THAT BARELY ANY VISIBILITY. IT CAUSED THE GROUND STOP OUT WEST WHAT COULD BE THE BIGGEST SNOWSTORM OF THE SEASON: 12 FEET OF SNOW FORECASTED FOR SOME SPOTS, FOR MORE THAN 12 MILLION PEOPLE, THE POTENTIAL OF HAIL, ATTENTIVE WIND AND MAYBE EVEN TORNADOES. IT IS ESPECIALLY DANGEROUS GETTING CLOSE TO THOSE NIGHTTIME HOURS WHEN WE NOTE TWISTERS ARE DANGEROUS. THEY ARE NOT NORMAL FOR THIS TIME OF THE YEAR. THIS FAR NORTH, IN THE COUNTRY LOOK, ALABAMA, MISSISSIPPI, THEY GET HUNDREDS. NOT THE CASE FOR ILLINOIS AND INDIANA. THAT IS WHY WE ARE KEEPING AN EYE ON THIS SO CLOSELY. THIS IS NOT NORMAL FOR THIS TIME OF THE YEAR. IT FEELS MORE LIKE SUMMER THAN WINTER. HIGHS IN A LOT OF PLACES 5-30 DEGREES ABOVE AVERAGE. MORE THAN 100 RECORDS HAVE BEEN SAID IN THE LAST 24 HOURS. IN KANSAS, PEOPLE WERE LITERALLY OUT SHOPPING FOR FLOWERS IN THEIR GARDENS- DON'T PUT THE JACKETS AWAY. TOO EARLY TOMORROW MORNING, THE WHIPLASH METEOROLOGIST BILL KARINS IS COVERING ALL OF THAT- THE POTENTIAL FOR THIS WEATHER TO WRAP UP ANY MINUTE. NOW IT HAS BEEN SO WARM, THE TEMPERATURES WILL DROP AND THAT WILL CREATE A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY. >>. WILL TALK TO YOU AN HOUR AGO. SINCE THEN WE CAN TELL THE WIND IS PICKING UP. THE BIG CONCERN IN THESE EARLY EVENING HOURS, HAIL, THAT IS ACCORDING TO THE METEOROLOGIST AT THE NATIONAL WEATHER CENTER. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HAIL THAT COULD BE THE SIZE OF A GOLF BALL. NOT ONLY ARE THEY TALKING ABOUT THIS HEAVY HAIL, WE COULD SEE THE TEMPERATURES DROPPED FROM 50-60 DEGREES. THAT IS OVER A 24 HOUR PERIOD. NOT ONLY DO YOU HAVE A THREAD OF HAIL PLUMMETING TEMPERATURES AND WITH THAT, WHEN THAT COLD FRONT MOVES IN, YOU SEE THE CREATION OF POSSIBLE TORNADOES HAPPENING OVERNIGHT. AS YOU SAID, HAILLE, THE ELEMENT OF DANGER, INCREASES THERE HOURS EARLIER, WE SAW PEOPLE OUT WALKING ALONG THE STREETS HERE IN DOWNTOWN, CHICAGO. WE EVEN SAW PEOPLE SWIMMING AT THE LAKE. THEY WERE TAKING IT ALL IN, BUT THEY NO CHANGES COMING SOON HAILLE >>. WE CAN SEE THAT WIND PICKING UP EVEN WHERE YOU ARE. LET'S BRING IN METEOROLOGIST BILL KARINS. WE ARE SEEING THIS TORNADO WATCH. WHAT IS THE TIMING ON THAT? >>. IT WILL BE ABOUT 7:00 TO ROUGHLY 10:00 PM, AND THEN ALONG OHIO RIVER AS WE GO THROUGHOUT THE OVERNIGHT HOURS. LET'S FIRST FOCUS ON THE AREA TO THE NORTH. THAT MEANS THEY NOW THINK THERE IS AT LEAST A CHANCE OF NOT JUST A TORNADO BUT A STRONG TORNADO. THAT WOULD BE SOUTH OF CHICAGO. THEN YOU HAD THAT HUGE AREA WITH AT LEAST A CHANCE. WHY DO WE CARE ABOUT THAT? THEY ARE TYPICALLY MORE DEADLY. THAT IS WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO SPECIFY: WHAT AREAS GET A CHANCE OF SEEING THAT. HERE IS THE FIRST TORNADO WATCH. WE WANTED TO INCLUDE THE SOUTH. WE WANTED TO INCLUDE THE SOUTH AREA, AND IF YOU NOTICE IN THE CORNER YOU SEE A LOT OF THESE LITTLE RED DOTS POPPING UP. THESE ARE RAPIDLY DEVELOPING THUNDERSTORMS. NO WARNINGS WITH THESE YET, BUT JUST HOW QUICK THEY REALLY PROPPED UP. THESE HAVE BEEN POPPING IN EVENTUALLY HERE TOWARD THE CHICAGO AREA, OVER THE NEXT COUPLE HOURS, AS FAR AS THE OHIO RIVER YEAR AREA. GO TO CINCINNATI, ALL THE BRIGHT RED HERE INTO WESTERN KENTUCKY. THESE ARE ALL POTENTIALLY STRONG THUNDERSTORMS. THEY LOOK LIKE. THEY TYPICALLY PRODUCE THE LARGEST HAIL AND TORNADOES. IT WILL BE ALONG THAT LINE. IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT THE SEVERE WEATHER THREAT DIMINISHES, THEN A LOT OF SOAKING RAIN THROUGH THE REGION, INCLUDING WASHINGTON ALONG WITH IT. GUSTY WINDS ALREADY. A DIFFICULT TRAVEL DAY AND AT THE AIRPORT BY 6:00 PM. THAT SQUALL LINE ALL THE WAY DOWN APPROACHING RALEIGH AND, IF YOU HAVE ANY FLIGHTS TOMORROW, A LOT OF DELAYS. ROCHESTER WITH 73 TODAY, ST LOUIS AT 85 DEGREES. CHICAGO, JUST SHY OF YOUR RECORD AT 73.. THE TWO BIGGEST ONES HERE'S INTERSTATE 40. THAT IS ONE OF THE BIGGER BLAZES BURNING RIGHT. NOW WE HAVE A WARNING FOR THOSE BLAZES AS THEY CONTINUE. HOPEFULLY WE WILL GET LUCKY. HOPEFULLY IT WILL MISS US AND NOT HIT >>. THANK YOU FOR KEEPING AN EYE ON ALL OF THAT. WE APPRECIATE IT >>>. WE ARE COUPLE OF HOURS AWAY FROM POLLS CLOSING THEIR. HOW VOTERS ARE FEELING. THIS COULD BE THE KEY SWINGS. THEY COME NOVEMBER. SOME DEMOCRATS ARE STILL UPSET OVER HOW HE HANDLED HE ISRAEL- HAMAS WAR LISTEN WHY SOME ARE VOTING UNCOMMITTED MET. WE VOTED UNCOMMITTED AGAIN TO PUT THAT PRESSURE ON THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION SO WE CAN SEE PEACE >>. I'M HOPING THAT IT WILL TELL THE PARTY THAT THEY ARE MAKING THE PARTY THAT THEY ARE MAKING TERRIBLE DECISIONS >>. SO THERE IS A QUESTION ABOUT HOW MANY VOTERS WILL N FACT PICK UNCOMMITTED INSTEAD OF PRESIDENT BIDEN. ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE, FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP TRYING TO KEEP UP HIS WINNING STREAK. NEITHER OF THEM ARE EVEN BOTHERING TO TRAVEL TO MICHIGAN. I WANT TO GET INTO EMBASSY. SHAQ BREWSTER LISTEN. LET'S START ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE. THAT IS WHERE SOME OF THE SUSPENSE IS TONIGHT. IT WOULD NOT HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE OUTCOME OF THIS PRIMARY RIGHT. HOW CONCERNED IS TEAM BIDEN ABOUT THIS ISSUE RIGHT? IT SIGNALS A MESSAGE ABOUT DISPLEASURE WITH HIS HANDLING WITH THE WAR IN GAZA. HOW CONCERNED ABOUT THIS BEING A PROBLEM? >>. YEAH HAILLE, THIS COULD BE A SOURCE OF EMBARRASSMENT FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN. WHEN YOU TALK TO THE GROUPS THAT ARE TRYING TO ORGANIZE PEOPLE TO VOTE UNCOMMITTED, THEY SAY THEY ARE TRYING TO GET TO ABOUT 10,000 VOTERS TO VOTE UNCOMMITTED INSTEAD OF VOTING FOR JOE BIDEN. MANY OF THEM SAID THEY SUPPORTED JOE BIDEN BACK IN 2020.. YOU ASKED ABOUT HOW CONCERN -- THEY HAVE BEEN POINTING TO SOME CONTEXT WHICH IS IMPORTANT HERE? 10,000, THAT GOAL YOU ARE HEARING FROM THIS GROUP. IT IS ABOUT HOW MANY PEOPLE VOTED UNCOMMITTED IN PREVIOUS ELECTION CYCLES, AT LEAST THE PAST THREE ELECTION CYCLE BACK IN THOSE. YOU HAD ABOUT 20,000 VOTERS SELECTING UNCOMMITTED. THAT WAS WITHOUT ANY BIG UNORGANIZED EFFORT. THEY ARE DEFINITELY PAYING ATTENTION TO THIS. YOU HAVE GROUPS SAYING THEY ARE TRYING TO SEND A CLEAR MESSAGE. PEOPLE WHO WERE WITH HIS BASE ARE NO LONGER WITH HIM. THEY WANT TO SEE A CHANGE OF POLICY FROM THE PRESIDENT. >>. THERE IS ALSO SOME CLARITY. FINALLY, I JUST WANT TO REMIND PEOPLE WE EXPLAINED THIS DRAMA WITH THE GOP. MOST OF THEIR DELEGATES WILL GET ASIDE SATURDAY. THERE'S ACTUALLY TWO CONVECTION -- CONVICTIONS. WHO RUNS THE PARTY? DOES ANYBODY HAVE AN ANSWER? >> RIGHT THE JUDGE SAYING THAT IT IS NOT THE PREVIOUS COMMITTEE CHAIR. REPUBLICAN PARTY CHRISTINA KAMMERER, WHO HAS BEEN TRYING TO HANG ONTO POWER, DESPITE THE FACT SHE WAS VOTED OUT LAST MONTH. SHE WILL HAVE TO RELINQUISH CONTROL OVER THE GOP WEBSITE HERE, PLANNING TO HOST THE CONVENTION THIS WEEKEND. THERE IS ONE CHAIR- THE CHAIR THAT WAS ELECTED LAST MONTH- WHAT HAPPENS TONIGHT WITH PRIMARY THAT WILL DETERMINE WHAT HAPPENS TO ABOUT 16 OF MICHIGAN'S 55 DELEGATES. THE REST WILL BE ALLOCATED AT THAT CONVENTION. THAT WILL TAKE PLACE THIS WEEKEND. THERE WILL BE ONE CONVENTION WITH WHAT THE JUDGE IS SAYING, THE RIGHTFULLY APPOINTED CHAIR THAT WILL BE TAKING PLACE HERE IN GRAND RAPIDS HAILLE. >> SHAQ BREWSTER, LOT TO FOLLOW THERE. THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US. >>> AWAY, AND WE DON'T HEAR A LOT OF THESE DAYS WHEN IT COMES TO CONGRESS GETTING STUFF DONE. OPTIMISM, HOW ABOUT THAT? THAT IS THE WORD FOR NOW. PRESIDENT BIDEN LOOK AT THIS ALONGSIDE THE TOP FOUR LEADERS FOR WHAT ONE OF THOSE CALLS AN INTENSE MEETING. THEY ALL SEEM TO AGREE NOBODY WANTS HIS PARTIAL GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN. THE COULD START AT MIDNIGHT ON FRIDAY. >>. THIS WOULD DAMAGE THE ECONOMY SIGNIFICANTLY. WE NEED A BIPARTISAN SOLUTION >> OKAY. SO WHAT HAPPENS IF THE GOVERNMENT DOES SHUTDOWN ON SATURDAY, ESSENTIALLY AS OF THE STROKE OF MIDNIGHT? THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY TRANSPORTATION, THEY WOULD POTENTIALLY COME UP THERE MARCH 8th WORKERS AND THOUSANDS OF OTHERS FOR -- THEY ALL WON'T GET PAID BUT SOME WILL STILL HAVE TO COME TO WORK. CHUCK SCHUMER SAYS THINGS GOT IN HIS WORDS. FEISTY WIN MONEY FOR UKRAINE CAME UP WITH HOUSE SPEAKER MIKE JOHNSON. >> THE MEETING WITH UKRAINE WAS ONE OF THE MOST INTENSE I'VE EVER ENCOUNTERED IN MY MANY MEETINGS IN THE OVAL OFFICE. >> INTENSE. HE SAYS: WE WILL GET IN THAT IN JUST A SECOND. WE WILL START IN JUST A SECOND HERE. HERE I REMEMBER A TIME. THAT IS MAYBE NOT OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER A TIME. GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWNS WERE BAD POLITICS RIGHT. THAT WAS A REAL CONCERN FOR LEADERS IN OFFICE. WE ARE ENTERING AN ERA WHERE WE'VE SEEN A BUNCH OF THIS TALK US THROUGH THE THINKING FROM THE WHITE HOUSE ON THIS ULTIMATELY. IT IS AN ACT OF CONGRESS. CONGRESS HAS TO DO IT. IT IS REALLY NOT US >>. EXACTLY HAILLE. WE'VE GOTTEN WAY TOO USED TO THIS, THIS OPTIMISM. THE AGENCIES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT WOULD HAPPEN. THEY WOULD HAVE TO PREPARE FOR THIS ACTUALLY TAKING PLACE. THEY SENT OUT ALL OF THOSE GUIDANCE LAST WEEK, GIVING A HEADS UP: HEY, THIS ACTUALLY MIGHT HAPPEN. YOU NEED TO BE READY IN CASE. HERE'S WHAT OUR PLAN WOULD BE. WE KNOW SOME OF THE AGENCIES THAT WILL BE AFFECTED IN THE INITIAL ROUND OF THE SHUTDOWN AT THE END OF THIS WEEK. THEY REALLY DO HAVE REAL-WORLD IMPLICATIONS FOR PEOPLE IN TERMS OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS LIKE THE HOUSING AUTHORITY, THE HOUSING SUBSIDIES FOR LOW INCOME HOUSING. ALSO. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION, SOMETHING WE COVER A TON OF IN YOUR SHOW: THE AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS THAT HAVE BEEN A RESULT OF THIS GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN. THERE ARE ALSO SERIOUS IMPLICATIONS FOR THINGS LIKE VETERAN AFFAIRS, THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE, AGAIN. THAT IS JUST PART ONE OF THIS. IF THERE IS AN AN AGREEMENT BEYOND THAT THERE COULD BE A FULL GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN. WE DO REMEMBER THOSE HAVE A LOT OF PINPOINTS. THERE ARE MILLIONS AFFECTED BY THAT HAILLE >> TOTALLY SEPARATE. COME MONICA RIGHT ON UKRAINE, THAT ALSO CAME UP IN THIS MEETING. WHAT IS INTERESTING? THE VERY DIVERGENT OPINIONS OF PEOPLE INSIDE THAT ROOM AS IT RELATES TO WHETHER OR NOT. THE US SHOULD SEND MORE MONEY OVER TO UKRAINE TO HELP AFTER RUSSIA INVADED TWO YEARS AGO. SO WHY DID THINGS GET SO QUOTE, UNQUOTE, INTENSE, AS CHUCK SCHUMER PUT IT MET. FOR A LONG TIME THERE HAS BEEN BIPARTISAN SUPPORT OF SENDING MORE MILITARY AID TO UKRAINE. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE PRESIDENT THOUGHT: HEY, IF I LUMPED THIS TOGETHER WITH OTHER PRIORITIES, AKA ANOTHER GOVERNMENT FUNDING REQUEST, WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET ACROSS THE FINISH LINE. THERE HAS BEEN SUCH A DEEP DIVISION WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. THIS IS INCLUDING HOUSE SPEAKER MIKE JOHNSON. THIS IS BEEN A REAL, REAL ISSUE. IF YOU DO NOT PROVIDE THE FUNDING FOR UKRAINE, IT WILL LOSE THE WAR AGAINST RUSSIA. THERE ARE CERTAIN AIR DEFENSE CAPABILITIES. EMMA WAS RUNNING SO LOW. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT WEEKS HERE AND NOT MONTHS. THAT COULD HAPPEN. THEY ARE HOPING THEY HAVE TO GET OVER THIS GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH THAT REQUEST MAY BE AS EARLY AS NEXT WEEK HAILLE. ALL OF THIS HAPPENING IN A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION YEAR. MONICA ALBA, THANK YOU SO MUCH. >>>. TO JORDAN -- GEORGIA. NOW THAT ELECTION INTERFERENCE CASE AGAINST DONALD TRUMP. WHEN EXACT WAY THAT THE FULTON COUNTY DA START DATING THE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR SHE PICKED TO LEAD THIS CASE, LOOKING FOR SOME ANSWERS. THE JUDGE IS CALLING BACK TERRENCE BRADLEY TO THE STAND. HE IS THE X DIVORCE ATTORNEY FOR NATHAN WADE. THE LAWYER FOR MR TERMS CO- DEFENDANT, WAS ASKING QUESTIONS FOR HOURS AND HOURS TO FILL IN THE TIMELINE. WHEN DID THEY START DATING? >>. THERE WASN'T SOMETHING I COULD ATTRIBUTE TO HIM TELLING ME WHATEVER AT THIS TIME. I'M TELLING YOU THAT I DO NOT HAVE THE DATE. >> REMEMBER WHY THIS MATTERS? THE JUDGE COULD PICK THE DA FANI WILLIS OFF THIS CASE. SHE MAY HAVE HAD BENEFITED FINANCIALLY FROM THIS. THEY SAID IT IS ALL ABOUT THE TIMELINE. WILLIS AND WADE SAID THEY STARTED DATING IN 2022. AFTER SHE HIRED HIM, ONE OF HIS FORMER FRIENDS SAID: OH NO, THE RELATIONSHIP STARTED. OH NO, THE RELATIONSHIP STARTED YEARS BEFORE, BACK IN 2019.. THE REASON WHY THIS IS A BIG DEAL IS BECAUSE OF THIS QUESTION OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST. RIGHT CLICK, THIS MEANS ESSENTIALLY, THE CASE COULD FALL APART. WHAT DOES THE JUDGE NEED TO HEAR TO TRIGGER A RULING ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. >>. THE LAW IN ORDER TO DISQUALIFY A PROSECUTOR, THERE HAS TO BE THE EXISTENCE OF AN ACTUAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST. THAT'S BEEN DEFINED AS A PROSECUTOR HAVING A FINANCIAL INTEREST IN THE CONVICTION OF A DEFENDANT. IF YOU WERE TO KEEP WITHIN THE GUARDRAILS OF THAT, YOU WOULD SAY WHERE. SO FAR WE HAVEN'T HEARD ANY EVIDENCE. AND THEN FROM THE BOYFRIEND NATHAN WADE. SO FAR THE TWO OF THEM BROKE UP. THIS WAS IN JUNE OF 2023.. IT IS NOT LIKE SHE IS STILL DATING HIM AND HE IS STILL LEARNING MONEY ON THIS CASE, OR SHE IS RECEIVING BENEFITS AT SOME POINT IN TIME. THIS CASE TOOK A DETOUR. IS THERE PERJURY BEING COMMITTED? HAVE THEY LIED TO THE COURT WHEN THEY SAID THEIR RELATIONSHIP AGAIN? AFTER, NATHAN WADE WAS APPOINTED SPECIAL PROSECUTOR IN ORDER TO FURTHER EXPLORE THAT THE JUDGE ALLOWED THE FORMER DIVORCE LAWYER TO TAKE THE STAND FOR THE SECOND TIME IN ORDER TO TESTIFY AFTER THAT PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NATHAN WADE, HIS FORMER CLIENT, AND FANI WILLIS. WE WEREN'T SURE IF WE WOULD HEAR FROM THEM >> YEAH >>. IT DIDN'T EXIST. INSTEAD WHAT MR BRADLEY HAD TO SAY, I HAVE NO PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE THE WAY THAT I HAVE INTERPRETED IT HAILLE YET. HE HAS NO EVIDENCE AS TO WHEN THAT RELATIONSHIP STARTED >> WOULD -- WHEN WOULD? WE KNOW ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. WHAT DO WE THINK? >> THIS COMING FRIDAY, IN JUST TWO DAYS, MAYBE THREE DAYS- WE WILL HAVE THE CLOSING ARGUMENT AND PROBABLY, WITHIN 7-10 DAYS, WE SHOULD HAVE A WRITTEN ORDER. >> IT IS ONLY UP TO THE JUDGE. THERE IS NO JURY, JUST THE JUDGE. >> JUST THE JUDGE. IF THE CASE DOES GET DISQUALIFIED, THE ENTIRE OFFICE IS OFF. THIS CASE, ANOTHER, DAS OFFICE WOULD BE APPOINTED. THAT IS THE BIG QUESTION. WITH THE OFFICE CONTINUE TO PURSUE ALL THE CHARGES. >>. KATIE, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING THERE AND BRICK AND THAT ALL DOWN. WE APPRECIATE IT. >>>. A NEW BILL HAS BEGAN WORKING ITS WAY THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE THAT WOULD PROTECT, LEGISLATURE THAT WOULD PROTECT IVF. IN THAT STATE SEEMS LIKE THINGS HAVE BEEN HAPPENING AT LIGHTNING SPEED, BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN THIS ISSUE WASN'T EVEN ON THE RADAR LIKE A WEEK AGO. THE COURT RULING WAS ON FEBRUARY 16th. THE FIRST CLINICS -- TWO MORE FOLLOWED. THEY CAME UP WITH A BILL TO PROTECT IVF OVER THE BEGIN, SAYING AN EXPLOSIVE DETONATED AT HIS OFFICE. LAW ENFORCEMENT'S ARE INVESTIGATING THAT BOTH -- REPUBLICAN. THIS IS ALL HAPPENING IS THE BIDEN TOP OFFICIAL IS MEETING TODAY WITH FAMILIES AND DOCTORS IN ALABAMA WHO SAY THEIR LIVES AND PRACTICES HAVE BEEN THROWN INTO CHAOS BY THIS COURT RULING AND HIGHLIGHTING THE SIGNIFICANCE IN REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS IN THE ELECTION YEAR >>. WE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WHAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO DO, TRYING TO BE SUPPORTIVE TO PEOPLE WHO WANT TO ACCESS THEIR ACCESS RIGHTS. WHEN ROE V WADE WENT DOWN TAKING AWAY ACCESS AND HEALTHCARE RIGHTS, IT DID IT TO MORE THAN JUST ABORTION CARE. >>. KATHY PARK'S LIFE FOR US IN BIRMINGHAM AND JOINING US NOW. WHAT DO WE KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING. WE KNOW THERE HAS BEEN INTENSE PUSHBACK AFTER THE COURT RULING, INCLUDING FROM REPUBLICANS ON THE NATIONAL LEVEL, EVEN FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP WHO SAID: WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING TO PROTECT IVF. WHAT DOES THE LANDSCAPE LOOK LIKE TO DO JUST THAT? >>. Reporter. YEAH, YOU KIND OF PICK THROUGH EVERYTHING. THERE HAS CERTAINLY BEEN A LOT OF MOVEMENT. TODAY IT IS NO EXCEPTION. ALABAMA REPUBLICANS ACTUALLY PRESENTED TWO PIECES OF LEGISLATION AND PROTECTING PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS FROM ANY CIVIL OR CRIMINAL PENALTIES, AND LAST WEEK PRESENTING A SIMILAR PIECE OF LEGISLATION. THE GOVERNOR OF ALABAMA SEEMS TO SUGGEST THAT SHE WILL GET A BILL RELATIVELY SOON, POTENTIALLY IN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS. I WILL BE WATCHING THAT CLOSELY IN THE MEANTIME HAILLE. THINGS ARE STILL VERY MUCH IN LIMBO FOR THE IVF PATIENTS. YOU HEARD THE SECRETARY THERE HERE AT BIRMINGHAM A FEW HOURS AGO, AT A ROUNDTABLE WITH IVF PATIENTS AS WELL AS THEIR PROVIDERS, HEARING SOME GUN WRENCHING -- GUT WRENCHING STORIES. THEY CAME DOWN FEBRUARY 16th, JUST A MOMENT AGO, WE SPOKE WITH HANNAH. SHE WAS TELLING US HOW DIFFICULT THE IVF PROCESS HAS BEEN FOR HER. TAKE A LISTEN >>. WE, MORE THAN ANYONE, KNOW THAT AN EMBRYO DOESN'T EQUAL A CHILD. IF IT DID, WE WOULD BE PREGNANT >> [ CRYING ] >>. WE WANTED IT DESPERATELY TO BE A CHILD. IT NEVER WILL BE. >>. Reporter HAILLE: THE FALLOUT HAS BEEN FLIPPED HERE. YOU HAVE AT LEAST THREE FERTILITY CLINICS THAT HAVE CAUSED TREATMENTS AND IN AT LEAST TWO EMBRYO SHIPPING FACILITIES. THAT HAS PAUSED HERE A LOT OF QUESTIONS THAT ARE BEING RAISED ALONG WITH HER BEING RAISED ALONG WITH HER INSURANCE -- HUNDREDS IN MONTGOMERY, ALABAMA, HOLDING A RALLY. THEY SAY WHAT THEY HAVE A DAY. THEY SAY WHAT THEY HAVE A DAY OF URGENCY. IT WOULD JUST BE AN INTERESTING DAY TOMORROW. WE WILL LIKELY SEE SOME FIREWORKS AMONG THESE PATIENTS >>. NO KIDDING, I'M GLAD HE WILL BE THERE. MORE REPORTING ON THAT IN THE HOURS AND DAYS TO COME. >>> OVERSEAS WITH HAMAS AND ISRAEL TONIGHT, BOTH POURING COLD WATER ON THOSE SURPRISE COMMENTS FROM PRESIDENT BIDEN. THE PRESIDENT SAID WHILE HOLDING AN ICE CREAM CONE IN NEW YORK 24 HOURS DOESN'T SEEM LIKE. ISRAEL IS ON THE SAME PAGE, THEY SAY THEY DIDN'T KNOW. THE PRESIDENT WAS GOING TO SAY THAT IN THE FIRST RACE, HAMAS GIVEN THE SAME MESSAGE. HERE TOO, LET'S BRING IN RAF SANCHEZ. SO WHAT'S UP WITH THIS WHIPLASH? THE PRESIDENT CAME OUT IN THIS VERY CASUAL SAYING YEAH, I'M HOPEFUL. THEN HE IS OVERSEAS. BOTH SIDES WERE PRETTY DISMISSIVE, PRETTY QUICK. WHERE DO THINGS STAND? >>. Reporter HAILLE. ISRAEL AND HAMAS DON'T AGREE ON VERY MUCH. THEY DO SEEM TO BE ON THE SAME PAGE WITH THIS MONDAY DEADLINE. ISRAELI OFFICIALS ARE SAYING THEY WERE SURPRISED. THEY DID NOT GET ANY HEADS UP FROM THE WHITE HOUSE THAT THIS WAS A DEADLINE, A GOAL AND ASPIRATION THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN WAS GOING TO BE SETTING. WE DID HEAR A STATEMENT FROM PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU TONIGHT. HE MADE NO MENTION OF A DEAL INSTEAD. HE SAYS HE BELIEVES HE HAS ENOUGH AMERICAN SUPPORT TO CONTINUE HIS CAMPAIGN INSIDE OF GAZA. FROM HAMAS' PERSPECTIVE, THEY HAVE BEEN CALLING HIM A POLITICAL HYPOCRITE FOR SAYING THAT HE WANTS TO SEE A CEASE FIRE, AT THE SAME TIME SUPPLYING MORE WEAPONS TO ISRAEL. ANY TALK OF DEAL IS PREMATURE, WHAT WE KNOW. NEGOTIATIONS AT THIS POINT ARE FOCUSED ON A PROPOSAL LAID OUT BY BILL BURNS. IT INVOLVES A PAUSE IN THE FIGHTING FOR UP TO SIX WEEKS. HAMAS HAS RELEASED AROUND 40 HOSTAGES, INCLUDING THOSE WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO COME OUT IN THE LAST DEAL. ISRAEL IS EXPECTED TO RELEASE HUNDREDS OF PALESTINIAN PRISONERS, INCLUDING SOME WHO WERE SERVING LONG JAIL SENTENCES FOR OTHER SERIOUS OFFENSES. BOTH SIDES ARE SAYING THERE IS MAJOR STILL OUTSTANDING WHAT EXACTLY IS THE RATIO OF PRISONERS TO HOSTAGES AND IF THEY WILL WITHDRAW FROM PALESTINIAN CITIES INSIDE OF GAZA. HAMAS SAYS THEY WANT THEM OUT OF THE STRIP. ALTOGETHER HAILLE >>. PRESS IN TEL AVIV: THANK YOU. LOTS MORE TO GET HERE TO >>>.

THEY WILL USE AI TO FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH YOUR FOOD WILL CAUSE AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT. CALEB SILVER IS JOINING US NOW. THEY ARE CALLING THIS SUGGESTIVE SELLING. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS, DO YOU? >>. I THINK IT MEANS THEY WILL UPSELL, WHENEVER THEY CAN, SURGING THE PRICES OF PRODUCTS IN DEMAND IN FAST FOOD. THERE ARE OTHER CHOICES. WENDY'S IS JUST FOLLOWING SUIT WITH OTHER COUNTRIES THAT ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. WHEN THEY CAN UPSELL ITEMS, RAISE THE PRICE ON THINGS AND ALSO LOWER THE PRICES ON THINGS THAT AREN'T SELLING. WELL, WE WILL HAVE TO GET USED TO IT. IN THE FAST FOOD INDUSTRY, THIS IS AN EXPERIMENT THEY INTEND TO BRING OUT IN 2025.. IF IT WORKS, YOU CAN EXPECT OTHERS TO FOLLOW SUIT. >>. CAN WE? I WONDER ABOUT THE POTENTIAL SHOPPER BACKLASH TO THIS. FOLKS HAVE A LOT OF CHOICES. >>. THEY DO. IF YOU ARE A BACON EATER FAN OR FROSTY FAN, YOU WILL STICK WITH THIS. THE ONE THING TO CONSIDER WENDY'S RELIES ON ITS FRANCHISES. FRANCHISES IT'S GOT ABOUT 60,000, ABOUT 80% OF THOSE ARE OWNED BY FRANCHISES- SMALL BUSINESSES. FOOD PRICES IN GENERAL HAVE BEEN VERY HIGH. IT HAS GONE UP ABOUT 20% SINCE PER PANDEMIC. YOU ARE RIGHT. IN THE FAST FOOD INDUSTRY, THOSE CHOICES ARE ABOUT 20-30 FEET AWAY. >>. TALK ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE IN PRICING. ARE WE SAYING IT COULD GO LIKELY? AVERAGE PRICE WOULD WE SEE A SEVEN DOLLARS FROSTY OR A $.10 FROSTY? HOW MUCH IS THE SWING? WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR WHAT I'M SPENDING >>. IT DEPENDS ON THE TIME OF DAY. WITH THE LUNCH TIME CROWD YOU CAN SEE THE PRICES SURGE. THEY HAVEN'T BEEN VERY SPECIFIC ABOUT IT. THE WHOLE POINT IS TO USE AI FOR DIGITAL MENUS. WENDY'S IS TRYING TO GET INTO THIS AS WELL SO THEY CAN MANAGE THEIR INVENTORY BETTER. UPSELL THINGS THAT ARE SELLING WELL FOLKS THAT ARE EATING AT WENDY'S. THEY ARE ON A BUDGET >>.

AI TALENT AND ENGINEERING TALENT IS SO HARD TO COME BY RIGHT NOW THEY ARE HAVING TROUBLE RECRUITING PEOPLE. THEY DID DISABLE THE TOOL. THEY ARE SAYING WE MISSED THE MARK. IT IS INACCURATE.

EVERY NIGHT, YOUR NEWS PLAYLIST TOP STORY WITH TOM LLAMAS STREAMING WEEKNIGHTS AT 7:00 ON NBC NEWS NOW >>>. WE KNOW THE SUPER BOWL JUST HAPPENED. THE NEXT SEASON IS BEING TALKED ABOUT NOW. WHY? BECAUSE OF THE NFL COMBINE. THERE IS ONE TOOL THEY DON'T WANT THEIR PLAYERS GRADED ON TELLING. PLAYERS DO NOT TAKE THE COGNITIVE TEST- A BIG REASON LACK OF TRUST. CJ STROUD HAS HIS GOURLEY. LAST YEAR IT HAD TEAMS DOUBTING THEIR INTELLIGENCE. HE STILL WON TOP OFFENSIVE ROOKIE, BECOMING MAYBE THE BIGGEST YOUNG STAR IN THE LEAGUE. THE NFL HAS DONE THIS INTELLIGENCE TEST FOR YEARS. THERE ARE ACCUSATIONS NOW THAT THEY HAVE A RACIAL BIAS THESE TESTS. IS THIS NEW ONE SUPPOSED TO CUT THIS OUT? WE AGAIN HAVE ISSUES OF A BLACK ATHLETE AND ISSUES AND WHISPERS OF HOW SMART HE IS. >>. Reporter TELLS US THAT EXISTED IS ONE USED WIDELY, NOT JUST FOR FOOTBALL PLAYERS BUT FOR COMPANIES TO EVALUATE THE COGNITIVE ABILITY- THE NEW TEST- THAT IS BEING DISCUSSED. LOOK FOR DIFFERENT THINGS. THAT ARE MORE SPECIFIC PERHAPS. WHEN YOU THINK OF WHAT FOOTBALL PLAYERS HAVE TO DO ON THE FIELD, IT WILL TEST THE PROCESSING, SPEED, REACTION, TIME, HOW THEY REACT UNDER STRESS. THEY ARE DIFFERENT RIGHT. THE OLD ONE IS NOT REALLY BEING USED BY THE NFL. THERE ARE TWO THINGS BEING LOOKED AT. IT IS A SERIES OF QUESTIONS THAT HAVE TO BE ANSWERED. LOOKING AT MATH AND VOCABULARY, ACTUALLY USING TECHNOLOGY FOR PLAYERS TO KEEP TRACK OF OBJECTS FOR A QUARTERBACK. IT CAN TEST THE ABILITY WHERE A QUARTERBACK AND LOOK AT AN OBJECT -- A FEW DIFFERENT OBJECTS. THAT IS SOMETHING THEY DO ON THE FIELD. RIGHT, THEY HAVE TO LOOK AT DIFFERENT PLAYERS: PLAYERS COMING AGAINST HIM AND WHO HE IS THROWING THE BALL TO. THAT IS ALSO WHY HALF THE TEAMS IN THE NFL ARE USING THAT TO EVALUATE THE QUARTERBACKS. THESE ARE TEAMS THAT INVEST A LOT OF MONEY WHEN THEY MAKE A DECISION AND DRAFT A PLAYER. THAT IS WHY THEY BROUGHT IN THE SECOND TEST AND WHY IT HAS BECOME SO POPULAR. >>. OKAY, YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT USING IT FOR QUARTERBACKS. RIGHT, YOU GOT OTHERS, ONE AGENCY- SAYING IT IS NOT RIGHT FOR A PLAYER'S MENTAL TO BE DISCUSSED BY THE PUBLIC. IT SEEMS LIKE TO THE AVERAGE PERSON GOING WAIT A SECOND. WHAT IF MY TEST SCORES LEAK? CJ WAS STILL GOOD. HE WAS STILL NUMBER TWO IN LAST YEAR'S DRAFT AND STILL A GREAT PLAYER >>. Reporter: CORRECT HAILLE. THE AGENCY ADVISING THE ATHLETES NOT TO TAKE THIS TEST BROUGHT THIS UP. WHAT HAPPENED TWO YEARS AGO? CJ STROUD TOOK THIS TEST. ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WAS THAT THE INFORMATION WAS LEAKED. THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE PRIVATE INFORMATION. THAT INFORMATION IS DELIVERED TO THE TEENS AND THEN THAT OF COURSE AFFECTED THE PLAYER. FOR NOW WE HAVE AGENTS ADVISING THE PLAYERS NOT TO TAKE THOSE COGNITIVE TESTS. THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER QUARTERBACKS, LIKE BROCK PURDY, PATRICK HARMS -- PATRICK MAHOMES, JOE BURROW. THEY TESTED VERY WELL IN THE TEST. WE CAN GO ON THE SERVER AND SEE HOW EVERYONE SCORED. SOME INFORMATION HAS BEEN LEAKED. WE KNOW WHO DID WELL AND WHO DIDN'T. THERE IS AN ARGUMENT FOR THOSE WHO TESTED WELL AND IS DOING WELL IN THE LEAGUE MOVING FORWARD. IT HAS WORKED FOR SOME TEAMS. THE CJ STROUD INCIDENT WILL ALSO HELP. IF SOMEONE DOESN'T TEST WELL, THEY CAN STILL HAVE A VERY GREAT YEAR, LIKE HE DID. >>. WE APPRECIATE THAT. >>> ONE OF THE BIGGEST CITIES IN THE COUNTRY. FORMALLY >>, KRISTEN WALKER HOSTS MEET THE PRESS EVERY SUNDAY ON NBC. >>>. IN JUST THE LAST COUPLE OF MINUTES TONIGHT, THE SAN FRANCISCO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS HAS VOTED TO ONLY APOLOGIZE TO BLACK RESIDENTS FOR DECADES OF RACIST LAWS. MAKE YOU SEE THE NAMES ON THE ROSTER. THIS RESOLUTION IS APPROVED. THE RESOLUTION IS ABOUT THAT UNANIMOUSLY. >>. SAN FRANCISCO IS NOW ONE OF THE FIRST BIG CITIES TO DO THIS. THEY ARE ALSO CONSIDERING. THEY ARE ALSO CONSIDERING REPARATIONS. OUR LAURA BARRETT, FOLLOWING THE STORY NOW TALK YESTERDAY: SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS APOLOGY. WHAT COMES NEXT? >>. THIS IS THE FIRST STEP THAT COMES TO FRUITION AFTER MORE THAN 100 PUZZLES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE ARE CELEBRATING AS A GREAT FIRST STEP. THERE IS A LOT OF PUSHBACK FROM THE BLACK COMMUNITY: 46,000 PEOPLE IN THAT POPULATION. FIRST, THE REACTION AS THE VOTERS PASSED >>. WE HAVE MUCH MORE WORK TO DO. THIS IS MOST CERTAINLY AN IMPORTANT STEP: OVER 100 RECOMMENDATIONS MAY. >>. SAN FRANCISCO WAS APOLOGIZING AND ALSO MAKING A PROMISE AND COMMITMENT TO NEVER REPEAT. ALSO WORKING, TOWARD, SOLVING AND IMPROVING CYST TO MAKE RACISM COMING FROM SOMETHING IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY. THAT THIS IS QUOTE: COTTON CANDY, RHETORIC REPARATIONS. THAT THE COMMITTEE -- RECEIVING A $5 MILLION LUMP SUM CASH PAYMENT TO REMEDY SAN FRANCISCO'S QUOTE: THE RACIAL WEALTH GAP. SHE BELIEVES THAT REPARATION SHOULD BE HANDLED AT A NATIONAL LEVEL. ACTUALLY, BECAUSE OF A BUDGET CRUNCH- $4 MILLION IN THEIR REPLETION ADVISORY, WE WILL SEE MORE REACTION COMING IN BROADLY. THE LAWMAKERS HAVE INTRODUCED ANOTHER REPARATION BILL THAT WILL TACKLE SOME PROPERTY ISSUES. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO FOLLOW.",[52]

HERE IS TOM LLAMAS. >>> THAT EVENING, WELCOME TO A SPECIAL EDITION OF TOP STORY. BREAKING NEWS: AN NBC NEWS ELECTION ALERT POSTED HAVE JUST COME ACROSS MICHIGAN. WE HAVE A CALL. NBC NEWS CAN PROJECT THAT FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP HAS WON THE MICHIGAN PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY. DEFEATING FORMER UN AMBASSADOR NIKKI HALEY GOING 5 FOR 5 IN THE FOREST. -- FIRST RACES OF THE 2024 RACE. NBC NEWS CAN PREDICT PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN HAS WON THE MICHIGAN DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY. HOW MANY DEMOCRATS WOULD VOTE UNCOMMITTED. LET'S TAKE A MOMENT TO LOOK AT THIS. WITH 10% OF THE VOTE IN, YOU HAVE 60% UNCOMMITTED. ABOUT 17,000 THEIR VOTING UNCOMMITTED. JOE BIDEN, THE CLEAR WINNER. AT 78% OF THE VOTE, WE HAVE COMPLETE TEAM COVERAGE TONIGHT. TONIGHT, MIKE AND EMILY SAID BREWSTER JOINING US HERE GABE. THE BIG HEADLINES TODAY WILL BE WHAT ARE THE TOTALS WHEN IT COMES TO THAT VOTE VERSUS JOE BIDEN. HAVE YOU HEARD YET FROM THE BIDEN-HARRIS RE-ELECTION TEAM AND IS IT OVER PERFORMING OR IS IT WHAT PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE? >>. HI THERE, TOM. WE HAVE HEARD FROM THE CAMPAIGN. BEFORE WE GET TO THAT, I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT WE ARE SEEING. MORE THAN 16% AT THIS POINT. IT IS STILL EARLY 10% OR SO OF THE VOTE IS IN. 50% IS ALREADY HIGHER. THIS IS THE THRESHOLD THEY HAVE SET. TOM, ORGANIZERS SAY THAT THEY WANT MORE THAN 10,000 UNCOMMITTED VOTES. WE ARE UP AT 17,000.. THEY CROSSED THE THRESHOLD SIGNIFICANTLY. HOWEVER, THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN HAS PORTED OUT -- POINTED OUT- THAT INCLUDING THIS ELECTION UNCOMMITTED WAS ACTUALLY PRETTY WELL IN THE MICHIGAN PRIMARIES, BECAUSE THEY HAD AROUND 20,000 VOTES. STILL, THESE NUMBERS ARE SIGNIFICANT. WE ARE HEARING FROM THE BIDEN- KARIS -- IDEN-HARRIS CAMPAIGN: DEMOCRATS WILL BE WATCHING THIS TOM. YOU WILL SEE HOW THIS GOES IF IT PERHAPS GOES ABOVE 100,000.. THE ORGANIZERS OF THIS GROUP SAY THAT WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT. USE MESSAGE FOR THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN OF COURSE, THIS HUGE POPULATION. WE'VE BEEN SPEAKING WITH VOTERS TODAY WHO ARE VERY FRUSTRATED WITH THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION'S HANDLING OF THE ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR. THEY DECIDED TO VOTE UNCOMMITTED TO SEND A CLEAR MESSAGE. TOM, WE WILL SEE WHERE THOSE NUMBERS GO. YOU HAVE 10%. WE ARE AT 17,000 FOR UNCOMMITTED- AGAIN A LOT OF VOTES ELLIPTICALLY COUNTY. I DO WANT TO ASK YOU, FROM YOUR CONVERSATION THEY WERE GOING TO VOTE FOR UNCOMMITTED? WHAT PERCENTAGE WOULD YOU SAY HAD TO DO WITH THE GAZA WAR AND HOW MUCH WERE OTHER DEMOCRATS JUST SORT OF UNSATISFIED WITH PRESIDENT BIDEN? >>. Reporter. WE'VE BEEN SPEAKING WITH SEVERAL VOTERS HERE ACTUALLY AT THIS LOCATION AT DEARBORN HIGH SCHOOL. HERE WE SPOKE WITH SEVERAL PEOPLE FRUSTRATED WITH THE WHOLE PROCESS. THEY CAME HERE AND ACTUALLY VOTED FOR NIKKI HALEY BECAUSE THEY WERE FRUSTRATED THAT THE TWO FRONT RUNNERS OF THE PARTIES -- THEY CITED AGE CONCERNS. WE ARE SEEING RIGHT NOW FROM THESE EARLY RESULTS THAT, ONCE AGAIN, FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO HAVE A HUGE VICTORY HERE IN MICHIGAN. HE HAS NOW WON THESE FIVE CONTESTS IN TERMS OF THE DEMOCRATIC VOTERS WHO CAME OUT TO VOTE. SOME OF THEM CAME HERE AND SAID THAT THEY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THEY WOULD EVENTUALLY VOTE FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN IN NOVEMBER BUT THEY THOUGHT WAS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO SEND THAT MESSAGE RIGHT NOW. SOME OTHER VOTERS WE SPOKE WITH. HE SAID HE WAS EVEN CONSIDERING CHANGING AND VOTING FOR FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP EVEN THOUGH. HE IS A LIFELONG DEMOCRAT. THE BIGGEST CONCERN AMONG DEMOCRATS IS WHETHER, OR NOT THESE UNCOMMITTED VOTERS, WHATEVER THEY VOTE IN NOVEMBER. THE BIGGEST CONCERN IS WHAT IF THEY STAY HOME? MICHIGAN IN 2016, WHEN FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP HAD JUST 10,000 VOTES, PRESIDENT BIDEN WON THE STATE BY JUST 155 VOTES IN 2020.. IF THEY STAY HOME, IT COULD BE HUGE FOR THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN COME NOVEMBER. TOM >>. YOU TALK ABOUT REPUBLICANS. NOW THE RESULTS WE HAVE THERE. THE HALEY CAMPAIGN SET THE BAR INCREDIBLY LOW. RIGHT. RIGHT. NOW, WHERE WE ARE AT WITH NIKKI HALEY: ONLY 9% OF THE VOTE HAS BEEN COUNTED. A LOT OF THE VOTE IS STILL LEFT TO BE COUNTED OUT THERE IN MICHIGAN. RIGHT NOW, SHE WASN'T EVEN IN MICHIGAN TODAY. RIGHT, ESSENTIALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THE SUPER TUESDAY STATES. THIS IS EXPECTED TO BE A BLOWOUT FOR THE FORMER PRESIDENT. >>. YEAH, THAT IS RIGHT, TOM. SHE WILL BE IN UTAH TOMORROW. NIKKI HALEY IS ALREADY MOVING ON TO THE UTAH STATE. >>. Reporter. SHE HAS NOT COMMITTED ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. IT IS CLEAR THAT HER CAMPAIGN HAS SO MUCH RIDING OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS. SHE IS STILL TRYING TO MAKE THAT CASE. THEY NEED SOME ALTERNATIVE TO FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. ACTUALLY, WE ARE EXPECTING TO HEAR FROM THE FORMER PRESIDENT POTENTIALLY CALLING INTO THE GOP WATCH PARTY HERE IN MICHIGAN. THAT COULD HAPPEN AT ANY MOMENT. THE CAMPAIGN THERE IS NOT EVEN MENTION OF NIKKI HALEY. THERE THEY ARE SETTING THEIR SIGHTS SQUARELY ON THE ELECTION AND FOCUSING ON PRESIDENT BIDEN AT THIS POINT. TOM >> WE APPRECIATE ALL OF YOUR REPORTING NOT ENOUGH TO PREVENT PRESIDENT BIDEN FROM CLINCHING A VICTORY. I WANT TO SPEAK NOW WITH NBC WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT. HE JOINS US FROM DEARBORN MICHIGAN. THIS IS KIND OF CRAZY. I WANTED TO TELL VOTERS EXACTLY WHERE YOU ARE IN YOUR CAREER AS A POLITICAL REPORTER. >>. Reporter- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT, TOM. THIS IS THE FIFTH POLITICAL ELECTION CYCLE I'VE HAD THE FORTUNE TO COVER. THIS IS NOT A PRIMARY NIGHT FOR CANDIDATE OR EVEN A PARTY. IT IS FOR UNCOMMITTED. IT IS ACTUALLY QUITE A PARTY. WE'VE ALREADY BEEN HEARING FROM A NUMBER OF SPEAKERS- THIS IS THE LISTEN TO MICHIGAN CAMPAIGN, WHICH I'VE BEEN TRYING TO REALLY ORGANIZE. THIS EFFORT. IT IS REALLY FASCINATING. GABE MENTIONED THAT THEY WERE SETTING INITIAL PROJECTIONS OF ABOUT 10,000.. ONE DEMOCRATIC SOURCE, NOT AFFILIATED, SAID IT COULD GET AS HIGH AS 100. >>. MIKE, HOW MUCH DID YOU PUT ON THAT RIGHT. MAYBE THE UNCOMMITTED SAID IT WAS VERY LOW. MAYBE OTHER DEMOCRATS WERE SETTING IT PRETTY HIGH. DO YOU GET A SENSE? >>. I THINK WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS LOOK AT SOME OF THE COUNTIES THAT WE ARE ALREADY SEEING SIGNIFICANT VOTING. SO FAR, THIS IS A COUNTY DIVIDING TEAM -- A COUNTY THE BOUNCY TEAM HAS BEEN LOOKING AT. LOOKING AT A COUNTY LIKE ANN ARBOR. THAT IS A COLLEGE TOWN, THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN. THE NUMBER FOR UNCOMMITTED THERE WAS OVER 25% AT. THAT KIND OF NUMBER CONTINUES THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT. WE HAVEN'T EVEN SEEN YET, WHERE THE HEART OF THE CAMPAIGN REALLY RESTS. TOM. I WAS TALKING TO VOTERS ALL DAY. IT TOOK A LONG TIME BEFORE I WAS ABLE TO TALK TO SOMEBODY THAT HAD NOTED THIS. IN THE PRIMARY BASED ON THEIR MODELING, THEY SAID 100,000, EVEN THE MINIMUM. I FORGOT TO MENTION PART OF THAT NUMBER. IT REFLECTS THE FACT THAT THE TURNOUT IN THIS DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY WILL BE MUCH BIGGER THAN IT USUALLY IS. THAT REFLECTS THE ORGANIZING EFFORTS ON THE PART OF THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN, ESPECIALLY WITH THIS PROCESS, ESPECIALLY WITH THIS PROCESS: VOTE >>. YEAH, THAT IS A GREAT POINT TO MAKE. I DO WANT TO ASK YOU: FROM YOUR CONVERSATIONS WITH THOSE UNCOMMITTED VOTERS, WE CAN HEAR THE BACKGROUND OF THE PARTY YOU ARE AT. WE ARE HEARING PALESTINE, ISRAEL. WE CAN KIND OF MAKE THAT OUT IN THE SPEECH IS BEHIND YOU. DO YOU THINK THESE VOTERS WERE SO UNHAPPY WITH PRESIDENT BIDEN? THIS IS THE KEY QUESTION. RIGHT THAT THEY WON'T SHOW UP IN NOVEMBER, OR ALSO THAT THEY WILL REMEMBER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S POLICIES? YOU HAD TO MOVE THE CAPITOL TO JERUSALEM? WILL THEY FORGET THOSE AND ONLY REMEMBER WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH PRESIDENT BIDEN: THE ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR >>. Reporter. YOU CAN HEAR IT NOW. THEY CERTAINLY WANT TO SEE IF THIS VOICE HAS REALLY BEEN GIVEN. THE PLATFORM IS INFLUENCING THE WHITE HOUSE. ONE OF THE ORGANIZERS SAID, WHEN THEY HEARD PRESIDENT BIDEN YESTERDAY HOLDING THAT ICE CREAM CONE TALKING ABOUT WANTING A CEASE-FIRE AS EARLY AS NEXT WEEK, THEY THINK THAT WAS A RESULT. SOME OF THE VOTERS I TALKED TO THEY SAID LISTEN. I SUPPORTED PRESIDENT BIDEN IN 2020.. IF WE DON'T SEE A CHANGE IN DIRECTION UNQUALIFIED FOR THE DIRECTION UNQUALIFIED FOR THE -- THEY WILL VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP. OTHER VOTERS I TALKED TO SAID LISTEN. TRUMP IS SUCH A THREAT FOR THIS COUNTRY. THE DEATH OF OUR DEMOCRACY, JOE. THE DEATH OF OUR DEMOCRACY. JOE BIDEN REPRESENTS THE DEATH OF OUR PALESTINIAN FRIENDS AND FAMILY. POWERFUL STATEMENT >> MIKE EARLIER. IN THE NIGHT I WAS SPEAKING WITH OUR POLITICAL PROS HERE AT NBC NEWS ABOUT HOW PRIMARIES MAKE CANDIDATES BETTER. RIGHT EVEN THOUGH. HE IS THE INCUMBENT. HE IS RUNNING ON --. THERE IS NO REAL CHALLENGE THERE. DO YOU THINK THIS PRIMARY PROCESS WILL MAKE PRESIDENT BIDEN A BETTER CANDIDATE? I MENTIONED THAT BECAUSE YOU MENTIONED THE ICE CREAM CONE MOMENT. HE'S HAD SOME TOUGH TIMES IN THE PAST FEW WEEKS. YOU'VE COVERED HIM FOR SO LONG. >>. Reporter. YEAH, I THINK ONE OF THE BIG RISK FOR ANY COMPANY -- CAMPAIGN REMEMBER WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD AGAINST MITT ROMNEY. HE WOKE UP AND ULTIMATELY WON THE ELECTION. I THINK THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN HAS FELT THAT SLOW AND STEADY WILL BE SUCCESSFUL FOR THEM. THEY WILL BE FEELING THAT EVEN THOUGH, A LOT ARE SAYING: LISTEN. WE NEED TO ORGANIZE EARLIER, MUCH MORE OF AN OPERATION. EARLIER, I THINK THAT WILL BE ANOTHER TAKE AWAY. YOU CAN'T TAKE STATES LIKE MICHIGAN FOR GRANITE. YOU NEED MUCH MORE MANPOWER WITH THE BATTLEGROUND STATES. ONE OF THE OTHER QUESTIONS, TOM THAT I THINK I HAVE ALREADY ASKED SOME OF THE ORGANIZERS HERE. WILL YOU TRY TO REPLICATE IT IN OTHER STATES? THIS WAS UNIQUE. I THINK THERE WILL BE DEMOCRATS DISSATISFIED WITH PRESIDENT BIDEN IN OTHER STATES. YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENED HERE TONIGHT. MAYBE, ORGANICALLY, THEY BEGIN TO TAKE THAT ON THEMSELVES. SOME OF THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN HAS FELT THAT THEY HAVE BEEN OPERATING ON THE RIGHT PATH BUT MAYBE NEEDING A LITTLE MORE FIRE, ACCORDING TO SOME THAT WE HAVE BEEN TALKING TO. >>. OKAY, MIKE, MEMOLI. MIKE, WE APPRECIATE ALL YOUR REPORTING. THE GOP CANDIDATES FACING OUT TONIGHT FOR JUST A FRACTION OF THE OVERALL NUMBERS. TONIGHT'S ELECTION DETERMINING HOW MANY OF MICHIGAN'S 55 DELEGATES WILL BE AWARDED FOR MORE ON THIS, I WANT TO BRING IN NBC SHAQUILLE BREWSTER JOINING US FROM MICHIGAN. WE WANT TO PULL UP THE RESULTS WE HAVE SO FAR NO SURPRISE HERE. RIGHT FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP WAS PROJECTED TO WIN THIS OVERWHELMINGLY. HERE ARE THE NUMBERS: WHERE THEY STAND, RIGHT NOW WITH 10% OF THE VOTE. IN 64%, SHE HAD PUT HER BAR 10% AGAIN POLITICS, SOMETIMES PEOPLE PUT THE BAR VERY LOW. EXPLAIN TO OUR VIEWERS WHAT EXACTLY IS GOING ON WITH THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN MICHIGAN, WHY ONLY SOME OF THE DELEGATES WILL BE AWARDED TONIGHT WHEN THERE IS ACTUAL VOTING, AND THE REST ON SATURDAY WHEN THERE IS A CONVENTION. >>. Reporter. YEAH, IT GOES BACK TO THE IDEA OF WHY WE ARE IN MICHIGAN RIGHT NOW. IN FEBRUARY, IT WAS PRESIDENT BIDEN WHO WANTED TO MOVE HIM UP TO ONE OF THE PRIMARY STATES. THE REPUBLICANS DIDN'T NECESSARILY AGREE WITH THAT. THAT THEY WANTED TO TAKE THE DATE IN MARCH, WITH IT HAPPENING TODAY, IN ORDER TO AVOID BEING PENALIZED BY THE MICHIGAN REPUBLICAN PARTY. THEY ARE DOING THIS HYBRID, DELICATE LOCATION SCENARIO. YOU HAVE ABOUT 16 OF THE DELEGATES BEING DELEGATED, BASED ON THE RESULTS OF WHAT YOU SEE TONIGHT. THE REST OF THEM, THE 39, WILL BE ALLOCATED AT THE STAKE CONVENTION HAPPENING THIS WEEKEND. THAT WILL BE UP TO THE PREFERENCES OF THE DELEGATES BY THE DISTRICTS. YES, IT GETS CONFUSING. WE KNOW A LOT OF THOSE DELEGATES WHO WILL BE AT THAT CONVENTION ARE TRUMP LOYALISTS SELF-DESCRIBED IN MANY CASES. WE EXPECT DONALD TRUMP TO GET AHEAD. THE DELEGATE MOVE FROM THAT CONVENTION. THEY HAVE BEEN COMING IN TO THIS POINT. IT SEEMS AS IF HE WILL GET AN OVERWHELMING SHARE OF THE DELEGATES. WE WILL KNOW THE SPECIFIC ALLOCATION UNTIL LATER THIS WEEKEND, WHEN THAT CONVENTION IS TAKING PLACE. >>. YOU WERE TALKING TO VOTERS TODAY. WERE YOU HEARING FROM REPUBLICAN VOTERS THAT WERE HAPPY NIKKI HALEY WAS STILL IN THIS RACE, OR WERE YOU HEARING IT WAS TIME FOR HER TO DROP OUT AND, SORT OF GET ALL THE SUPPORT BEHIND FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP? >>. BOTH AND IT DEPENDED ON WHO YOU ASK. THIS WAS IN TERMS OF WHAT: DROVE THEM TO COME OUT AND VOTE. TODAY I SPOKE TO ONE PERSON WHO SAYS HE LIKES PRESIDENT BIDEN BUT HE WANTED AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THIS AGAINST DONALD TRUMP, SO HE VOTED FOR NIKKI HALEY. SOME OF THEM SAYS IT IS BECAUSE THEY LOVE NIKKI HALEY. THEY WERE HERE TO SUPPORT HER POLICIES. AS ONE GENTLEMAN PUT IT TO ME: HER ETHICAL SENSE THAT SHE GIVES THEM THE CALM DEMEANOR THAT SHE HAS. I SPOKE TO ANOTHER COUPLE WHO TOLD ME THAT THEY CAME OUT AND SUPPORTED NIKKI HALEY BECAUSE THEY JUST DON'T LIKE DONALD TRUMP. THAT KIND OF PLAYS INTO WHAT WE HEARD OUT OF HER CLOSING MESSAGE HERE IN THE STATE OF MICHIGAN. NIKKI HALEY WAS HERE IN GRAND RAPIDS JUST YESTERDAY, WHERE SHE TOLD HER SUPPORTERS. IF YOU DON'T LIKE DONALD TRUMP AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE JOE BIDEN, THEN YOU SHOULD BE SUPPORTING ME. WE KNOW THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT POLLING ACROSS, THE COUNTRY FOLKS AREN'T HAPPY WITH THE FRONT RUNNER AND THE POTENTIAL OF A REMATCH BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP AND JOE BIDEN. NIKKI HALEY WAS HOPING THAT DESPITE YOUR PREFERENCES. WHETHER YOU LEAN DEMOCRAT, YOU ARE MODERATE OR A REPUBLICAN. THAT SHE CAPTURE SOME OF THAT ENERGY THAT SEEMED TO WORK WITH SOME OF THE FOLKS I TALKED TO. AS YOU SEE THE RESULTS COMING IN. WE HAVE ALREADY PROJECTED THIS RACE. IT CLEARLY WAS NOT ENOUGH TO LEAD HER TO VICTORY HERE. >>. WE APPRECIATE ALL OF YOUR REPORTING. FOR MORE, I WANT TO BRING IN NBC NEWS- SENIOR PROJECT EDITOR MARK MURRAY, RICH LOWRY, EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL REVIEW, AND NATHAN HAZE, A FORMER -- TO PRESIDENT BIDEN AND DIRECTOR OF MESSAGE PLANNING FOR THE WHITE HOUSE. MARK, LET'S START WITH YOU. WHAT IS YOUR REACTION TO TONIGHT'S RESULTS? I WANT TO PUT THE RESULTS ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE RIGHT NOW. THERE IT IS, MARK. TALK TO US ABOUT THIS. IS IT OVER PERFORMING OR WERE PEOPLE ADDICTED? >>. IT IS REALLY SO HARD TO GAUGE I FEEL LIKE. 15% OF THE BALLPARK IS SIGNIFICANT. THAT IS THE POINT IN WHICH YOU START PICKING UP DELEGATES ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE- THIS IS EITHER STATEWIDE OR PER CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT- UNCOMMITTED- COMING OUT WITH THE DELEGATE TO THE CONVENTION. IT IS NOT AN INSIGNIFICANT DEAL, BUT STILL. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE OVERWHELMING NUMBER OF DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY VOTERS RIGHT NOW ARE BACKING PRESIDENT BIDEN WITH THIS JUNCTURE RIGHT NOW. >>. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT AN UNCOMMITTED DELEGATE GOING TO THE CONVENTION, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? DO YOU HAVE SOMEBODY THAT KNOWS CANDIDATES AND THEY CAN VOTE ANYWAY THEY WANT? THAT IS SORT OF CRITICAL RIGHT AND WE HAVE NO REASON TO BELIEVE THIS RIGHT NOW BUT ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN IF THE CURRENT PRESIDENT IS NOT THE NOMINEE >>. YEAH, TOM, IT COULD END UP BEING CRITICAL. IF THERE IS A CONTESTED CONVENTION, ARE YOU END UP GOING TO THE CONVENTION IN CHICAGO AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN? I ALSO KNOW BACK IN 2012, THERE WAS SOMEONE BEHIND BARS GETTING 30-40% OF THE PRIMARY VOTE IN WEST VIRGINIA AND ENDED UP GETTING DELEGATES TO THE CONVENTION AS WELL AGAINST BARACK OBAMA. THAT WAS SEEN AS SORT OF A PROTEST VOTE IN WEST VIRGINIA. WHEN THIS HAPPENS -- UNTIL IT REALLY BECOMES A TRAINED RIGHT NOW- I THINK THE CONSISTENT THEME IS THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS AN ABSOLUTE LOCK ON THIS PARTY AND PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION, NOTWITHSTANDING DEALING WITH SOME IDEOLOGICAL BLOWBACK ON HIS HANDLING OF THE WAR? >>. WELCOME TO OUR FINE BROADCAST TONIGHT. DOES IT WORRY YOU, AS SOMEONE WHO HAS WORKED WITH PRESIDENT BIDEN, WHAT HIS NUMBERS ARE RIGHT NOW IN MICHIGAN AND SOME OF THE HEADWINDS HE IS FACING IN THIS RACE >>? I THINK HE IS OVERWHELMINGLY PERFORMING IN MICHIGAN AND IN EVERY OTHER STATE. IN THE PRIMARY UNCOMMITTED ARE PEOPLE WHO WANT THEIR VOICES HEARD AND THEY ARE TAKING NOTE. I MEAN, AS THE PRESIDENT MENTIONED YESTERDAY, HE IS HOPING FOR A CEASE-FIRE. I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT HIS STANDING IN THE PARTY >>. WE HAVE SOME DATA I WANT TO PUT UP ESSENTIALLY WHERE THE RACES HAVE TURNED OUT IN THE GENERAL ELECTION LOOKING BACK: WHEN FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP BEAT HILLARY CLINTON BY ABOUT 10,000 VOTES. 2020, PRESIDENT BIDEN BE TRUMP BY 150,000 VOTES. THAT WAS A BIG ONE. THERE WE TALK ABOUT A TIGHT RACE. NOW THE LATEST POLLS SHOW HIM SLIGHTLY AHEAD TALKING TO NBC NEWS. YOU HAVE THEM VOTING TONIGHT UNCOMMITTED. ARE YOU WORRIED THAT THEY GET SO UPSET OVER THE PRESIDENT'S HANDLING OF THE WAR WITH ISRAEL AND HAMAS QUICK THAT THEY DON'T SHOW UP ON ELECTION NIGHT? >>. NO, I AM NOT WORRIED. NOVEMBER IS A LONG TIME AWAY. AT THE END OF THE DAY, THEY WILL REMEMBER WITH. THE PRESIDENT HAS DONE FOR THEM 1800 THOUSAND IN MANUFACTURING ALONE. HE IS THE PRESIDENT, OUT FIGHTING FOR THEM AND WORKING HARD ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. NOVEMBER IS A LONG TIME AWAY. PEOPLE WILL SHOW UP IN NOVEMBER. >>. WE WILL TALK ABOUT NOVEMBER A LOT. I THINK WE WOULD TALK ABOUT MINORITY VOTERS A LOT. BE SUCH A TIGHT RACE. WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENS TO THOSE VOTERS? AND I TALKED TO MIKE MEMOLI ABOUT THIS. DO YOU THINK THEY STICK WITH WHAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IN GAZA OR DAVE? -- OR DO THEY REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED? >>. AT THE END OF THE DAY, THEY HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN BIDEN AND TRUMP. THERE IS NO WAY THAT WILL JUST SAY: OKAY, THERE WILL BE -- >>. YOU DON'T THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS TO WORRY MUCH ABOUT THIS? >>. I THINK HE HAS ALREADY MOVED ON ISRAEL IN PART BECAUSE HE IS WORRIED ABOUT THIS PHENOMENON IN MICHIGAN AND AMONG YOUNG VOTERS GENERALLY >> 15% OF PEOPLE ARE THEY NOT GOING TO BE THERE FOR BIDEN IN NOVEMBER? YOU'VE COVERED THE REPUBLICAN PARTY FOR YEARS, DECADES. WE WON'T SAY THE TRUMP CONSERVATIVES HAVE EVOLVED OVER THOSE YEARS AS SOMEONE WHO HAS PARTY THAT IS COVERED THE MOVEMENT >>. I THOUGHT SHE WOULDN'T MAKE IT TO SOUTH KARELINA. I THOUGHT JUST THE PROSPECT OF GETTING BEATEN PRETTY SOUNDLY, IT DIDN'T CLEARLY. SHE WILL GO THROUGH SUPER TUESDAY. IT LOOKS LIKE A PRETTY CRUSHING. IT LOOKS LIKE A PRETTY CRUSHING MARGIN >>. HE WAS HOPING TO STAY THROUGH MICHIGAN. >>. YES, WHERE ELSE COULD YOU POSSIBLY BE STRONG? BESIDE MICHIGAN, YOU CAN VOTE FOR ANY YOU WANT. SHE IS GETTING WIPED OUT THERE. SHE HAS THE STRONGHOLD AMONG COLLEGE-EDUCATED VOTERS AND IN THIS CURRENT PARTY THAT IS NOT NEARLY ENOUGH. >>. IS THERE ANY ROOM FOR HER TO SURPRISE PEOPLE AND STILL MAKE THIS A RACE? OR IS THE WRITING ON THE WALL? >>. YEAH, TOM, IT IS VERY TOUGH FOR HER. ONE OF THE THINGS TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT THE REPUBLICAN DELEGATE MASS EVEN ON SUPER TUESDAY, MANY OF THE STATES AND CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS OPERATING ALMOST ON WINNER TAKE. ALL THEY END UP GETTING 50% OR MORE, AND IN THE TWO PERSON RACE, SOMEBODY WILL GET AT LEAST 50% OR MORE. IF HE ENDS UP WINNING LESS THAN THE MARGINS THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY SEEING IN MICHIGAN, HE WILL RUN THE TABLE WHEN IT COMES TO DELEGATES. AT THE END OF THE DAY, IT IS A DELICATE GAME AND TWO THINGS CAN BE TRUE. OF NIKKI HALEY'S CAMPAIGN. SHE IS AN INCREDIBLE, WELL FUNDED CAMPAIGN. ON THE OTHER HAND, THIS IS THE LEAST COMPETITIVE PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY THAT WE HAVE SEEN NOT FEATURING AN INCOME IT PRESIDENT SINCE I'VE BEEN COVERING POLITICS. NOW, 0-5 FOR NIKKI HALEY GOING BACK TO OHIO LOOKING AHEAD TO SUPER TUESDAY. IT WILL NOT GET ANY EASIER. >>. A REMINDER: TED CRUZ STAYED AROUND THROUGH SUPER TUESDAY. WE WILL SEE WHAT NIKKI HALEY DOES. IF YOU CAN GIVE PRESIDENT BIDEN ONE PIECE OF ADVICE, SINCE HE IS IN THE MIDDLE OF A CAMPAIGN RIGHT NOW, WHAT WOULD YOU TELL HIM? >>. I THINK HE NEEDS TO TAKE NO AND LISTEN TO THE FOLKS OF MICHIGAN WHO ARE VOTING UNCOMMITTED. I THINK, JUST LIKE SOME OF THE OTHER PANELISTS HAVE SAID- OTHER PANELISTS HAVE SAID EARLIER- TO REALLY FOCUS AND TO LISTEN TO THIS VOICE COMING FROM THE UNCOMMITTED VOTERS AND REALLY TAKE ACTION. >>. YOU THINK IT WILL BE A CLOSE RACE, NO MATTER WHAT. >>. YEAH, BIDEN'S APPROVAL RATING BELOW 4%. THAT IS A REAL RED ZONE. AT THE END OF THE DAY, THEIR VOTE IS PRETTY WEAK. >>. THAT IS ONE WAY TO PUT IT. IT WAS A PLEASURE TO HAVE YOU ON THE SHOW TONIGHT. WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR ANALYSIS. THAT CONCLUDES OUR COVERAGE. WE WANT TO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING. THERE IS MUCH MORE TOP STORY COMING UP AFTER THIS BREAK. STAY WITH US. >>> BACK NOW WITH TOP STORY. >>> BACK NOW WITH TOP STORY TRYING TO REMOVE THE DA FANI WILLIS FROM THE ELECTION INTERFERENCE CASE, ANSWERING MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT ANSWERING MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHEN A RELATIONSHIP BEGAN. VAUGHN HILLYARD IS HERE WITH MORE >> WHETHER TO DISQUALIFY THE DA FANI WILLIS IN THE INTERFERENCE CASE UNDER INTENSE QUESTIONING. >> DO YOU RECALL ANY OTHER THING AT THIS POINT IN TIME UNDER OATH THAT WOULD INDICATE WHEN THE RELATIONSHIP STARTED BETWEEN MR WADE AND MS WILLIS? >> I DO NOT KNOW WHEN THE RELATIONSHIP STARTED BETWEEN MR WADE AND MS WILLIS. I CANNOT RECALL THAT. >>. Reporter. THE FORMER LAW PARTNER OF NATHAN WADE REPEATEDLY ASKED WHEN HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH WILLIS BEGAN. AT ONE POINT HE WAS ASKED ABOUT A TEXT MESSAGE WHERE HE SAID IT BEGAN BEFORE WILLIS HIRED WADE. >> WHY WOULD YOU SPECULATE WHEN SHE WAS ASKING YOU A DIRECT QUESTION ABOUT WHEN THE RELATIONSHIP STARTED? >>. I HAVE NO ANSWER FOR THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT YOU DO KNOW IN FACT WHEN IT STARTED AND YOU DON'T WANT TO TESTIFY TODAY IN COURT. >>. Reporter. IT WAS TWO WEEKS AGO THAT WILLIS TOOK THE STAND AND LASHED OUT AT THE DEFENSE ATTORNEY TRYING TO REMOVE HER OF THE CASE. >> THAT IS CORRECT. YOU TRY TO IMPLICATE THAT I SLEPT WITH HIM AT THE CONFERENCE, WHICH I FOUND TO BE EXTREMELY OFFENSIVE. >>. Reporter: SHE SAID THE RELATIONSHIP BEGAN AFTER. SHE APPOINTED HIM TO THE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR POSITION. >>. I AM ASKING YOU, WHETHER OR NOT. PRIOR TO NOVEMBER 1st OF 2021, THERE WAS A ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP WITH MR WADE. THAT IS VERY SIMPLE. IT IS EITHER YES OR A NOTE >>. I DIDN'T CONSIDER IT TO BE ROMANTIC BEFORE THAT >>. THE TRUMP TEAM BRINGS PHONE RECORDS ALLEGEDLY SHOW THAT, PRIOR TO NOVEMBER 2021, ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS, WADE ARRIVED LATE AT NIGHT AND STAYED UNTIL THE EARLY MORNING HOURS. HE WAS ALSO ASKED IN COURT HOW OFTEN HE VISITED. >> ANYTHING PRIOR TO NOVEMBER 1st OF 2021. YOU ARE AT THE CONDO MORE THAN 10 TIMES >>. NO, SIR. >>. SO IT WILL BE LESS THAN 10 TIMES >>. SO IF THE PHONE RECORDS REFLECT THAT YOU ARE MAKING PHONE CALLS BEFORE NOVEMBER 1st OF 2021, AND IT WAS ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS- THE PHONE RECORDS WILL BE WRONG >>. IF THEY REFLECTED THAT, YES, SIR, THEY WOULD BE WRONG >>. Reporter HIS -- TRUMP'S TEAM ALLEGED THAT IT DEMONSTRATES THAT HE VISITED HER HOME AT LEAST 35 TIMES AND IN THE WEEKS. IMMEDIATELY AFTER, WILLIS RESPONDED BY ASKING THE JUDGE TO EXCLUDE THE PHONE RECORDS, SAYING THAT QUOTE. THE RECORDS DO NOTHING MORE THAN DEMONSTRATE HIS TELEPHONE WAS LOCATED SOMEWHERE WITHIN A DENSELY POPULATED MULTIPLE MILE RADIUS WHERE RESTAURANTS, NIGHTCLUBS AND OTHER BUSINESSES ARE LOCATED >>. AND WITH THAT, VAUGHN HILLYARD JOINS IS NOW IN STUDIO. FIRST OF ALL, HAS THE JUDGE CAME UP WITH THE RULING OF WHETHER OR NOT? HE CAN OMIT THAT. >>. NO, NOT AT THIS POINT IN TIME, FANI WILLIS PUSHED BACK SAYING THAT NUMBER ONE, THE MESSAGES AND CONTEXT OF THEM ARE NOT EVEN KNOWN, AND THE FACT THAT SHE WAS ALSO RESPONDING TO CRIME SCENES IN THOSE AREAS OF COURSE, THE DEFENDANTS ARGUE OTHERWISE. >>. THE ISSUE HERE, ESSENTIALLY, IS THAT THE DA -- IT HAS HUGE IMPLICATIONS. RIGHT, THIS IS A HISTORICAL CASE. DO WE KNOW WHEN THE JUDGE WILL RULE? >> NO, WE DON'T. WITH EVERY PASSING DAY, IT MAKES IT EVEN MORE LIKELY THAT THE CRIMINAL CHARGE WOULD NOT GO TO TRIAL BEFORE THE 2024 ELECTION FOR FANI WILLIS. IF SHE IS DISQUALIFIED, THAT CAN PUT THE ENTIRE CASE IN JEOPARDY. LET ALONE MAKE IT MORE LIKELY THAT IT WOULD BEGIN UNTIL 2025.. >>. VAUGHN HILLYARD, WITH US ALWAYS GREAT TO HAVE YOU ON THE SHOW. >>>. WHEN WE COME BACK, STUDENTS -- SURVEILLANCE VIDEO CAPTURES A MAN APPEARING TO BE ARMED. >>>. WE ARE BACK NOW WITH THE >>>.

NEWLY RELEASED FOOTAGE SHOWING THE MOMENT: FIGHTER JETS LAUNCHING OFF AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER ON SATURDAY NIGHT IN THE RED SEA AND POUNDING SOME 18 TARGETS, INCLUDING UNDERGROUND WEAPONS, FACILITIES, DRONES AND AIR DEFENSE SYSTEMS, IN THE HOUTHI CONTROLLED AREAS OF YEMEN. IT IS THE FIRST JOINT MISSION BY THE US AND THE UK SINCE JANUARY. THE OPERATION IN RESPONSE TO A SEARCH OF HOUTHI ATTACKS. IT IS THE LATEST ATTEMPT TO TRY TO DETER THE IRAN BACK MILITIA- THEY SAY THE ATTACKS WILL CONTINUE- IS TRIGGERING GROWING FEARS. THE RIPPLE EFFECT OF THE GROWING ESCALATIONS WILL BE FELT AROUND THE WORLD AND AT HOME IN THE US. 90% OF VESSELS HAVE REROUTED. >>. THEY ARE EFFECTIVE IN TERMS OF DISRUPTING GLOBAL TRADE. >>. THEY ARE CALLING THIS THE BIGGEST BLOW TO SHIPPING SINCE THE PANDEMIC. >>. WHAT ARE WE SEEING? >> 40% OF GLOBAL TRADE TO EUROPE GO THROUGH THIS REGION. YOU MIGHT THINK: WELL, WHAT IS THE BIG DEAL? AT LEAST 1-2 WEEKS OF EXTRA SHIPPING TIME TO THOSE DELIVERIES. THEY CAN MEAN YOUR PRODUCT SHORTAGE ON SHELF. POTENTIALLY, IT CERTAINLY MEANS HIGHER COST >>. THE COST TO SHIP ONE CONTAINER IN DECEMBER FROM ASIA TO THE US WAS $2500.. THREE REITs --. WEEKS LATER, IT SKYROCKETED 10,000 ON THE SHIP. THAT IS AN INCREASE OF SOME 26 MILLION >>. WE ARE ON THE HILLS OF INFLATION. AT THE SAME TIME NOW, MANY, MANY PRODUCTS, RANGING FROM TOYS TO ELECTRONICS, THINGS LIKE HOME TO CORE ITEMS. THE BAD NEWS: THIS IS A MAJOR, MAJOR, LARGE-SCALE DISRUPTION >>. Reporter, A DISRUPTION THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE IMPROVING ANYTIME. SOON TOM MAJOR CAR COMPANIES HAD TO TEMPORARILY PAUSE OPERATIONS IN GERMANY FOR 2 WEEKS. IT COULD INCREASE WAIT TIMES FOR THEIR VEHICLES. WE'VE REACHED OUT TO TESLA FOR A COMMENT AND HAVEN'T HEARD BACK. THEY ARE REPORTING THAT THIS. THEY ARE REPORTING THAT THIS COULD LEAD TO ABOUT 5000 TO 7000 NOT BEING BUILT. >>. MEGAN FITZGERALD, THANK YOU FOR THAT. >>>. NEW REPORTING ON RUSSIAN OPPOSITION LEADER, ALEXEI NAVALNY AND A POSSIBLE DEAL. THAT WAS IN THE WORKS TO FREE. THAT WAS IN THE WORKS TO FREE HIM. BEFORE HIS DEATH. A PRISONER SWAP WOULD HAVE RELEASED HIM. HOWEVER, NOTHING WAS AGREED ON BEFORE HIS DEATH CLAIMING A RUSSIAN HITMAN WOULD HAVE BEEN A MYSTERY SOLVED AFTER MORE THAN 120 YEARS. AUSTRALIAN RESEARCHERS -- RESEARCHERS SHOWING IMAGES OF THE WRECKAGE FROM THE OCEAN FLOOR, FROM THE COAST IN AUSTRALIA. IT WENT MISSING ALONG WITH 32 CREW MEMBERS IN JULY OF 1904.. WEEKS LATER, SOMEBODY'S OF THE CREW MEMBERS WASHED ASHORE. HIS FINAL WRECKAGE PLACE WAS DISCOVERED IN 2022.. >>>. ONLY, COME BACK OUR ONE-ON ONE WITH DR PHIL WHAT HE IS HOPING TO ACCOMPLISH ON HIS NEW TV NETWORK AND WHAT HE THINKS ABOUT THE UPCOMING ELECTION AND SOME OF HIS FAVORITE- MAYBE NOT SO FAVORITE- TV MOMENTS. >>> WELCOME BACK. >>> WELCOME BACK TONIGHT IN OUR SPOTLIGHT INTERVIEW, THE MAN BEHIND ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL DAYTIME SHOWS EVER- DR PHIL, OUT WITH A NEW BOOK AND NEW CABLE NETWORK. YES, AN ENTIRE NETWORK. DR PHIL, TONIGHT IN STORY, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. AN ENTIRE NETWORK. >>. YEAH, WHEN YOU SAY IT THAT WAY, IT IS KIND OF SCARY. WE DO. WE HAVE A WHOLE NETWORK, OUR OWN NEWS DEPARTMENT. WE WILL HAVE LIFESTYLE PROGRAMMING. A LOT OF DR PHIL. >>. WHEN YOU GET THEM TO HATE HIMSELF CONFUSED AND ATTACKING THEMSELVES, YOU DESTROY THE FUTURE. >>. I'VE SEEN YOU TACKLE SOME MAJOR ISSUES HEAD ON. IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE ADVOCATING FOR ONE SIDE. IS THAT FAIR? >>. IT'S NOT. I WILL TELL YOU WHY. I WANT TO OPEN THE DEBATE LANE. I WANT TO HAVE FOUR SIDES OF AN ISSUE. COME ON AND TALK ABOUT IT. WHEN I SAY ALL SIDES, I WILL NOT PLATFORM THE. IF THERE IS A RESPONSIBLE SIDE TO AN ISSUE, I WANT THEM TO COME ON AND HAVE AN OPEN DEBATE >>. AND THAT IS WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE WHEN IT COMES TO TRANSGENDER ATHLETES, HIGH SCHOOL SPORTS. IT FEELS LIKE -- AT LEAST FROM THAT PROMO- THAT YOU ARE AGAINST THESE THINGS AND YOU DON'T THINK IT IS GOOD FOR AMERICA. >>. IT DEPENDS ON THE ISSUE. FOR EXAMPLE, MY SITE IS THE SCIENCE SIDE, THE FACTS SIDE. PEOPLE TELL ME HOW THEY FEEL AND I TELL THEM. I DON'T CARE HOW YOU FEEL. I BARELY CARE HOW I FEEL. WHAT ARE THE FACTS? WHAT DOES THE SIGN SAY? WE CAN PRETEND THAT HUNDREDS OF YEARS OF SCIENCE DON'T EXIST. I DON'T THINK IT IS RIGHT TO COME IN REWRITE HISTORY OR TAKE A BOOK AND PRETEND IT DIDN'T EXIST, DIDN'T EXIST. THAT IS AN INSULT TO AMERICA. OF COURSE IT EXISTED. IT WAS AN UGLY TIME IN OUR HISTORY BUT WE NEED TO LEARN FROM THAT. >>. DO YOU THINK THERE IS A DANGER, A TYPE OF INDOCTRINATION HAPPENING? >>. I THINK IT IS A DANGER AND I THINK PARENTS NEED TO STEP UP ABOUT THAT. TO SAY THAT PARENTS DON'T HAVE A ROLE IN THEIR KIDS EDUCATION IS A MISTAKE. AND LET ME SAY THIS: I'M SUCH AN ADVOCATE OF TEACHERS I CAN HARDLY LOOK THEM IN THE EYE. SOMETIMES WE PAY THEM SO LITTLE, THEY WORK SO HARD TO GET PAID TO LITTLE TO DO AN IMPORTANT JOB. PARENTS, WHEN I SAY, GET INVOLVED, DON'T RUN UP THE STAIRS WITH YOUR HAIR ON FIRE ACCUSING PEOPLE OF DOING SOMETHING OR WHATEVER. GO IN, FIND OUT WHAT IS GOING ON. GET INVOLVED, SUBMIT WE ALL -- IT'S CALLED. WE'VE GOT ISSUES. CHAPTER ONE, I SHOULD SAY CHAPTER 1, PART FOUR, TALK TO ME ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS >> 1984, WHICH I'VE HEARD SEVERAL TIMES. THEY HAVE THE LANGUAGE. YOU CAN DO THIS, YOU CAN DO THAT. IF YOU DO IT WRONG, YOU GET ON PERT STUDENT -- IN PERSON. WE CALL IT CANCELED. NOW IT'S JUST GOTTEN OUT OF CONTROL. COLLEGES- A LOT OF THEM- DON'T HAVE OFFICE OF ADMISSIONS, BECAUSE THAT IMPLIES SOMEBODY WILL BE REJECTED. THEY NOW HAVE OFFICE OF ENROLLMENT MANAGEMENT >>. SO WHERE DO YOU DRAW THE LINE? RIGHT? I DON'T THINK YOU WANT TO TURN BACK TO 1950.. IT LOOKS PERFECT ON TELEVISION BUT IT WASN'T. THERE WERE GROUPS THAT WERE SIDELINED. THERE WAS RACISM. IS THAT WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT? >>? CERTAINLY NOT TO SUGGEST THAT WE WANT TO TURN THE CLOCK BACK TO. THAT IS NOT AT ALL WHAT I'M SAYING. FOR EXAMPLE, THE PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT COMFORTABLE EXPRESSING THEIR OPINIONS COMPARED TO 1950, HAS TRIPLED >> WHAT HE THINK THAT HAPPENED >>. BECAUSE OF THE INTERNET, THEY WANT TO CATCH SOMEBODY WITH THE WRONG WORD IN THEIR MOUTH. GO AFTER THEM, WEAPON RISING THEM >>. I AGREE WITH YOU COMPLETELY: IS THE GENIE OUT OF THE BOTTLE? OR DO YOU THINK AMERICA CHANGES? >> ACTIVISTS FROM BOTH SIDES. I'M TOTALLY NONPOLITICAL. I WILL TELL YOU WHY. I DON'T KNOW A MUST -- ENOUGH ABOUT IT. MOST PEOPLE WHO SPEAK ABOUT IT DON'T. THEY JUST AREN'T WILLING TO ADMIT IT. IT WAS COOKED THE -- CATCHING PEOPLE WITH THEIR HAND IN THE COOKIE JAR. NOW IT IS CATCHING SOMEBODY WITH THE WRONG WORD IN THEIR MOUTH. I THINK THE IDEA CASHED IN WITH THE WRONG WORD. THEN MAKE AN EXAMPLE OUT OF THEM SO YOU CAN GET ATTENTION OR SOME MEDIA COVERAGE FROM IT. WE NEED A COUNSEL CULTURE, NOT A CANCEL CULTURE. IF SOMEBODY IS OFFENDING SOMEONE AND THEY ARE DOING IT CONSISTENTLY, SIT DOWN AND TALK WITH THEM. IT IS NOT A MATTER OF GOING AFTER THEM AND TRYING TO RUIN THEIR LIFE >>. YOU MENTIONED POLITICS HERE. ON TOP STORY, WE ARE COVERING THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION PRIMARY. WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP? YOU JUST SPOKE ABOUT LANGUAGE AND SOME OF THE LANGUAGE HE USES. >>. I HEAR A LOT OF THINGS SAID >>. I HEAR A LOT OF THINGS SAID NOW BY BOTH SIDES. SADLY, DON'T YOU HEAR THINGS SAID --? >>. WELL, WE HEAR FROM THE VOTERS. THEY ARE NOT HAPPY WITH THE TWO CHOICES. >> WE'VE GOT 50 CHOICES FOR MISS AMERICA AND 2 FOR PRESIDENT. WHEN I TALK TO PEOPLE THEY AREN'T HAPPY WITH THE CHOICES WE HAVE, I LOVE IT. WHEN WE ARE IN GRIDLOCK I GO OKAY, THEY CAN'T GO TOO FAR IN ONE DIRECTION. >> YOU ARE AN EXPERT IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR. A LOT IS BEING WRITTEN ABOUT OUR CURRENT PRESIDENT AS SOMEONE WHO STUDIED HUMAN BEHAVIOR FOR A LONG TIME. SHOULD AMERICANS BE WORRIED, AND IS HE TOO OLD FOR OFFICE? >>. I DON'T KNOW. I HAVEN'T HAD THE PLEASURE OF MEETING THE PRESIDENT. I TELL YOU WHAT, IF I DID, I WOULD TREAT HIM WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT. I TALKED IN THE BOOK ABOUT SOMEONE STANDING UP AND YELLING LIAR AT THE PRESIDENT DURING HIS STATE OF THE UNION MESSAGE. >>. YOU DID THIS WHEN YOU WORKED ON TRIAL TEAMS. YOU ARE A TRIAL EXPERT FIGURING OUT WHO WOULD BE THE BEST JURORS. DO YOU THINK HE STILL HAS IT TO RUN A SECOND TERM? >> IT APPEARS TO ME, FROM WHAT I SEE, THAT HE IS NOT AT THE TOP OF HIS GAME, AND I DON'T THINK HIS OPPONENT IS AT THE TOP OF HIS GAME 80 SEEMS REALLY OLD. I WOULD HOPE THAT IF I AM BECOMING ABLE TO LOSE MY COGNITIVE ABILITY, I WOULD HOPE SOMEONE WOULD TELL ME: HEY, IT IS TIME YOU BRING OTHERS ALONG TO HELP YOU. BUT I DON'T KNOW WHETHER I SUPPORT HIM AS A VOTEARE. NOT WHY WOULD PEOPLE BE UPSET WITH HIM? BECAUSE HE IS AGING. IT IS NOT HIS FAULT THAT HE'S AGING. >> SOMETHING. YOU ARE AN EXPERT IN DAYTIME TELEVISION. YOU DO SOMETHING -- YOU WRITE SOMETHING TO IT OPERA EVERY YEAR. YOU WRITE HER A THANK YOU NOTE EVERY YEAR. WHY DO YOU DO THAT? >>. THERE WOULD NOT BE A DR PHIL IF IT WASN'T FOR OPRAH. AFTER SHE HAD ON HER SHOW. I GOT MY WIFE. WE SAID: LET'S FIND OUT HER FAVORITE FLOWER. WE SENT HER 12 DOZEN, A NOTE AND A LITTLE GIFT. SHE CALLED ME AT THE TIME. SHE WAS ON THE AIR 15 YEARS. SHE SAYS: COME OUT OF ALL THE BOOKS I'VE LAUNCHED. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME SOMEONE HAS SAID: THANK YOU. CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT? >> ARE YOU STILL CLOSE? >>. WE ARE AT THE END OF THE YEAR. I WILL ALWAYS SAY: I WILL NEVER FORGET WHO BROUGHT ME TO THE DANCE. THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE. >>. THERE IS PROBABLY SOMEONE IN EACH OF THEIR -- OF OUR LIVES. WE SHOULD DO THAT, FOR THERE IS A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT WENDY WILLIAMS. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU EVER KNEW HER BUT PROFESSIONALLY, YOU GUYS WERE COMPETITORS IN THE SAME INDUSTRY. WHAT HAVE YOU MADE WITH? WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO HER? >>. WELL, I WAS ON WENDY'S SHOW FOUR OR FIVE TIMES IN NEW YORK. WHEN I WAS HERE SHE ASKED ME WHAT I COME ON. I SAID SURE IT WAS ALWAYS KIND OF LIGHT. SHE CALLED ME PRIVATELY ON THE SIDE AFTERWARDS. WE SPOKE MANY TIMES. SHE'S HAD A REALLY TOUGH TIME IN HER LIFE. I HATE NOW THAT SHE IS REALLY FALLING ON DIFFICULT TIMES. I HOPE PEOPLE WOULD SHOW HER SOME GRACE. I KNOW SHE HAS A PERSONA OF TELEVISION OF CALLING PEOPLE OUT. I KNOW HER PERSONALLY TALK. YOU KNOW IT IS OKAY TO TALK ABOUT THIS. SUICIDE DEPRESSION. WE MADE IT OKAY TO TALK ABOUT THIS. >>>. A NEW BOOK, A NEW NETWORK. NOW, BEFORE WE GO, GIVE OUR VIEWERS ONE PIECE OF LIFE ADVICE >>. I THINK THE IMPORTANT THING I WOULD TELL EVERYBODY BE WHO YOU ARE ON PURPOSE, JUST KIND OF REACT TO WHAT, THE JUST KIND OF REACT TO WHAT THE WORLD GIVES YOU AND KIND OF WORLD GIVES YOU AND KIND OF JUST WHAT IS SERVED UP IN A REACTIVE MOMENT. IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE LIVE WITH INTENTION. I WOULD HATE TO SPEND MY WHOLE LIFE BECOMING THE BEST WELDER OR ACCOUNTANT IN THE WORLD, ONLY TO GET THERE AND FIND OUT. I NEVER WANTED TO BE A WELDER OR ACCOUNTANT, TO BEGIN WITH. IF YOU DON'T LIVE WITH PASSION, THAT IS A TERRIBLE LOSS. IF YOU CAN FIND A JOB, YOU'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT GREAT. IF YOU DON'T LIVE WITH PASSION, THIS IS NOT A DRESS REHEARSAL. THIS IS OUR ONE SHOT. >>. WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORDS.",[52]
280,2LMafm5E1TY,Meet the Press NOW â€” Feb. 26,NBC News,2024-02-27 00:15:00+00:00,">>> FORMER FORMER PRESIDENT. >>>. FORMER FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP PUTTING HIS FOCUS ON THE GENERAL ELECTION AFTER WINNING OVER NIKKI HALEY IN SOUTH CAROLINA. SHE INSISTS. THAT IS A WARNING FOR THE PARTY FOR COCOA. THE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR OF MICHIGAN HAS ISSUES. SHE THINKS THERE COULD BE A SIGNIFICANT PROTEST VOTE TOMORROW AGAINST PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. >>> THE CRUNCH ON CAPITOL HILL WITH JUST DAYS AGO, UNTIL A PARTIAL GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN MIKE JOHNSON. UNDER PRESSURE FROM THE RIGHT, THE PRESIDENT WILL MEET WITH CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS AT THE WHITE HOUSE. WHITE HOUSE >>>. WELCOME TO MEET THE PRICE. SOUTH CAROLINA. THE LAST OF THE EARLY PRIMARY CONTESTS IS IN THE BOOKS. WE HAVE ONE DAY UNTIL MICHIGAN'S PRIMARY AND THEN EIGHT DAYS UNTIL SUPER TUESDAY. WHILE THE FORMER PRESIDENT, FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP KEEPS ROLLING TOWARD THE NOMINATION, THE PATH TO THE PRIMARY MAY NOT BE AS SMOOTH. HE WON THE PRIMARY TO BE NOTED AS A DOUBLE DIGIT WIN AND IN HIS VICTORIES EACH HE MADE CLEAR HE HAS HIS EYES ON THE GENERAL ELECTION >>. AN EVEN BIGGER WIN THAN WE ANTICIPATED. I WAS JUST INFORMED THAT WE GOT DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF VOTES THAT HAS EVER BEEN RECEIVED IN THE GREAT STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA. THAT IS PRETTY GOOD. IF I HAD THE RIGHT TO DO THIS, I WOULD DO IT TOMORROW >>. THEN THERE IS MORE CONSOLIDATION AGAINST THE CANDIDATE. SEE THE NUMBER TWO REPUBLICAN IS ENDORSED. AND THERE ARE RESULTS IN SOUTH CAROLINA THAT SUGGEST WE NEED THE NOMINEE. THERE ARE TALKS FOR AN ENDORSEMENT FROM THE HOUSE FOR PUBLICAN MITCH McCONNELL, AMERICANS FOR PROSPERITY. A COKE BROTHERS GROUP ANNOUNCED FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR TRUMP'S GROWING STRENGTH IN THE PRIMARIES IS ALSO REVEALING MAJOR WARNING SIGNS. THE RESULTS MAKE IT CLEAR THAT INSIDE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY THERE ARE STILL POCKETS OF DEEP TRUMP SKEPTICISM. IN SOUTH CAROLINA, 40% OF MARRIED VOTERS WENT FOR HALEY. THAT'S THE SAME LEVEL OF SUPPORT SHE GOT IN NEW HAMPSHIRE IN MICHIGAN. HALEY HOLDS UP 40% AS A FLASHING RED LIGHT. >>. DON'T TALK ABOUT FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP WINNING. HE DID. I GIVE HIM THAT. WHAT ABOUT THE FACT THAT IN ALL THE EARLY STATES HE DID NOT GET 40% OF THE VOTE. YOU CAN'T WIN A GENERAL ELECTION IF YOU DON'T GET TO 40%. IS HE DOING ANYTHING TO HELP HIMSELF? NO, HE SAID. ANYONE WHO SUPPORTED ME WAS BARRED PERMANENTLY. >>. THINK ABOUT THAT. YOU'RE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. YOUR JOB IS TO BRING AS MANY PEOPLE TO YOU AS POSSIBLE, NOT PUSH PEOPLE OUT. THAT IS WHAT HE'S DOING. HE'S PUSHING PEOPLE AWAY FROM THE REPUBLICANS. >>. TO HALEY'S POINT, THE FORMER PRESIDENT HAD A LOCK ON VOTERS WHO IDENTIFIED AS VERY CONSERVATIVE THE HARD-CORE REPUBLICAN BASED HALEY. BEAT HIM AMONG MODERATE REPUBLICAN VOTERS AND THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO NEED IN NOVEMBER. HALEY IS CONNECTING WITH THOSE VOTERS, THEIR UNHINGED IN IT. THE ELECTION DEMOCRATS, LIKE GAVIN NEWSOM, ARE CHEERING HER ON >>. I DON'T KNOW WHY DEMOCRATS WON HER OUT OF THE WAY. SHE IS ONE OF OUR BETTER SURROGATES. SHE'S MAKING POINTS. I AM APPLAUDING HER EVERY SINGLE DAY. I THINK SHE IS IN INCREDIBLY EFFECTIVE ALLEY. THE TALLY IS FOLLOWING NIKKI HALEY IN MICHIGAN >>. Reporter. DAY TWO OF CAMPAIGNING FOR NIKKI HALEY IN MICHIGAN. SHE REMAINS CONFINED THERE. SHE IS STAYING IN THE RACE AS SHE WANTS TO REMAKE THE REPUBLICAN COMMITTEE. THE PLAN IS TO INSTALL ALLIES AND FAMILY MEMBERS TOP THAT APPARATUS SO THAT HE CAN USE IT AS A SLUSH FUND FOR IS LEGAL FEES. THOSE ARE JUST SOME OF THE WARNINGS THAT SHE IS GIVING IN MICHIGAN. LISTEN TO ALL THE THINGS. SHE IS THROWING RED FLAGS AND WAVING THEM IN THE FINAL DAYS OF THE CAMPAIGN >>. I'M GIVING YOU EVERY RED FLAG. I POSSIBLY CAN ABOUT THE DIRECTION OF THE COMP NOW. I NEED YOU TO HEAR IT AND I NEED TO SEE THAT WE CAN STOP THIS SINKING SHIP BEFORE IT TAKES OFF >>. IF I'M NOT AN ALTERNATIVE FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP WILL LOSE. >>. SHE ENDED THERE AS SHE OFTEN DOES WITH AN ELECTABILITY ARGUMENT. IT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH THROUGH THE NEXT FEW DAYS IN THE MANY STATES. HALEY IS TRAVELING TOO. MICHIGAN VOTES TOMORROW, THEN HALEY START JUMPING THROUGH THE SUPER TUESDAY AND AS THE REST OF THE FIELD DOES OTHER THINGS, HALEY SAYS: THEY'RE NOT IGNORING HER OUT OF THE RACE, THEY'RE PLAYING CATCH-UP. SHE MADE THAT BORDER TRIP SEVERAL MONTHS AGO. >>. OKAY, JOINING ME NOW IS GARRETT HAIG. SHOT BREWSTER IS ALSO ON THE GROUND AND GRAND RAPIDS. GROUND AND GRAND RAPIDS, MICHIGAN. KENT COUNTY. HE IS AT THE BIG BOARD WITH SOME INSIGHT FOR SATURDAY'S RACE IN SOUTH CAROLINA TRUMP SAID SATURDAY NIGHT. THE PARTY HAS NEVER BEEN AS UNIFIED AS IT IS NOW. THIS IS ENOUGH FOR PRETTY CONVINCING WIN. WHAT IS IT MEAN FOR HIM IN NOVEMBER? >> HE'S RIGHT ABOUT THE STRUCTURAL PARTY IN ONE SENSE. HE IS RIGHT IN ONE SENSE. HE IS RIGHT. THE WARNING SIGNS ARE THERE FOR HIM THAT IT WILL BE HARD TO PUT TOGETHER A COALITION OF REPUBLICANS, THE PEOPLE YOU NEED TO WIN IN THE STATES. THAT MATTER COME NOVEMBER IS NOT CLEAR TO ME TO FIND OUT THAT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN HAS GRAPPLED WITH THIS AND HOW MUCH THEY ARE BANGING ON THE INVERSE OF THE BIDEN STRATEGY. THEY THINK PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN IS SO BAD THAT THEY WILL COME BACK, AS EVENTUALLY, THEY ARE NOT CONVINCING NIKKI HALEY VOTERS THAT THEY BELONG THERE. SHE SAID YOU ARE OUT FOREVER IF YOU DON'T SUPPORT ME. THAT'S NOT EXACTLY UNIFYING >>. RIGHT, WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS SITUATION BEFORE, WHERE THERE IS AN IDEA WHERE HE WILL PIVOT AND FOCUS ON A GENERAL ELECTION OPPONENT. THAT'S WHAT YOU TRIED TO DO. THERE IS ANOTHER EFFORT. WE WROTE THE STORY OVER THE WEEKEND ABOUT TRYING TO GET FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP TO PIVOT NOW. I WOULD ARGUE THAT JOURNALISTS COULD HAVE WRITTEN THIS EVERY SIX TO EIGHT WEEKS OVER THE LAST EIGHT YEARS, BECAUSE THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A PUSH FROM INSIDE THE ORGANIZATION AND OUTSIDE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY TO MAKE HIM MORE ACCESSIBLE AND MAKE HIM LOOK MORE TRADITIONALLY PRESIDENTIAL. HE CAN SOMETIMES SEND HIMSELF IN THAT DIRECTION FOR SHORT PERIODS OF TIME, BUT IT HAS NEVER SUSTAINED. YOU PIVOT ENOUGH TIMES. YOU ARE RIGHT BACK WHERE YOU STARTED, AND YOU COULD SEE THAT FROM FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. WITH THAT SAID, IT'S A DISAPPOINTING CAMPAIGN APPARATUS. AT THE END OF THE DAY, IT IS STILL FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. HE'S GOING TO DO WHAT HIS INSTINCTS TELL HIM TO DO. YOU TALK ABOUT THAT PROFESSIONAL CAMPAIGN APPARATUS, AND THE NEXT STORY COULD BE AN EXAMPLE OF IT. IT'S TIME FOR MITCH McCONNELL TO TAKE A HIKE. THEN THOSE IN THE McCONNELL ORBITER TRYING TO FIND SOME SORT OF REUNION >> YES, I THINK IT SHOULD COME FROM THE OTHER DIRECTION. IT WAS McCONNELL'S TEAM THAT STARTED LOOKING FOR AN APPROACH WITH FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. THEY HAVE NOT SPOKEN SINCE BEFORE JANUARY 6, AND THERE IS NO LOVE LOST. IF YOU WANT TO CONTINUE AS THE WORLD LEADER, YOU PROBABLY HAVE TO HAVE SOME KIND OF WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH TRUMP. THAT WILL INVOLVE AN ENDORSEMENT. THOSE CONVERSATIONS ARE UNDERWAY NOW. IT'S MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO HAPPEN AT SOME TIME. LET'S GO TO SHACK IN KENT COUNTY. WE'RE FOLLOWING THEM. AHEAD OF THE NOVEMBER ELECTION. YOU HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT A REMATCH >> Reporter THEY SEE PRESIDENT >>. Reporter THEY SEE. PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN AND FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP HAVE BEEN DOMINATING THEIR RESPECTIVE PARTY PRIMARIES. THAT'S THE MATCHUP WE WILL SEE IN NOVEMBER. HERE'S HOW THEY HAVE BEEN PLAYING IT >> SCARED. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT WILL HAPPEN. I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH- I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN OR TRUMP >> I THINK THEY'RE TOO OLD AND TOO OUT OF TOUCH >>. THERE IS A LOT OF FEAR. THIS IS WHAT 2024 IS GOING TO BRING: A PARTISAN EXPLOSION OF BRING. A PARTISAN EXPLOSION OF JANUARY 6.. THERE IS A WORRY. I THINK IT IS NOT GOING TO END, WELL? >> NO MATTER WHO WINS. >> YES, YOU COULD HAVE 49% AND 51%, AND 49% ARE GOING TO GIVE IT A TRY. 49% ARE GOING TO GIVE IT A TRY TO INVALIDATE THE ELECTION. >>. Reporter. THAT IS THE SENTIMENT THAT NIKKI HALEY IS TRYING TO TAP INTO FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP TIES PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN TO TO HIM AND SAYS: YOU DON'T LIKE THESE NOMINEES. SO, AS YOU HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT, THERE IS A HEAVY AND UPHILL BATTLE. SHE HAS TO FACE TO STOP THE MOMENTUM AT THIS POINT. >> YOU COVER MIDWESTERN EVENTS FOR US. FOR US, THIS IS IMPORTANT THIS NOVEMBER. >>. Reporter. YES, YOU CAN SEE THE TRENDS HERE AND THEY ARE REFLECTED ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THIS IS A COUNTY THAT WAS RELIABLE TO BE REPUBLICAN BEEN FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP WENT TO WIN THIS BY THREE PERCENTAGE POINT AND PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN SPLITS THE COUNTIES. THESE ARE MORE MODERATE VOTERS. MATTERS HOW PEOPLE THINK HERE, BECAUSE THEY CONTAIN THE MARGINS IN COUNTIES LIKE THIS ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND VOTERS ARE SAYING: I DON'T LIKE ANY OF THOSE, SO THAT'S TROUBLE FOR BOTH CANDIDATES. >>. NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. LET'S GO TO THE BIG BOARD. A LOT OF INFORMATION IN THOSE EXIT POLLS. WHAT DOES YOUR ANALYSIS TELL US ABOUT NOVEMBER >>? WE HAVE DYNAMICS HERE. HERE ARE THE RESULTS BY COUNTY. THERE ARE THREE COUNTIES HERE THAT FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP DID NOT CARRY, AND HERE IN THE LOW COUNTRY, POLICY FOR BEAUFORT COUNTY CREATED AN INTERESTING DYNAMIC. WE WILL SHOW YOU THE RESULTS BY CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT AND YOU CAN SEE THERE WERE 50 DELEGATES AT STAKE AND 29 OF THEM WERE STATEWIDE WINNERS. IF YOU WON THE DISTRICT, YOU GOT THREE DELEGATES. THIS IS TRUMP. READ HERE: HE ACTUALLY LOST THIS DISTRICT WHERE HILTON HEAD IS AND NIKKI HALEY GOT THREE DELEGATES OUT OF THIS STATE. WHAT IS IT THAT MADE THIS SO HOSPITABLE TO HALEY? THE DEMOGRAPHICS HAVE BEEN HERE FOR A WHILE. IT IS AN AREA THAT HAS SOME OF THE HIGHEST MEDIAN INCOME IN SOUTH CAROLINA. THEY HAVE THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF VOTERS, WITH COLLEGE DEGREES AND A TRUMP HOSTILE CRADDICK VOTE AND FRANKLY, ESPECIALLY, WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT IN CHARLESTON COUNT, THIS COUNTY IS ONE THAT FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP LOST TO PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. I THINK WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND WHEN WE ARE ANALYZING THIS. IT'S KEY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THESE INDEPENDENT VOTES AND REMEMBER DEMOCRATS WERE ALLOWED TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PRIMARY. WE DON'T KNOW THE NUMBERS HERE, BUT WE HAVE PEOPLE IN THIS PRIMARY WHO VOTED FOR PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN, WHO WANTED A CHANCE TO VOTE AGAINST FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. CHARLESTON COUNTY WOULD BE WHERE TO FIND THOSE VOTERS IN PRIMARIES AND GENERAL ELECTIONS. IT'S THE SAME IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, WHERE THE INDEPENDENCE GOOD VOTE, AND I THINK ONE THING WE HAVE SEEN HERE IS THAT THERE IS A VERY MOTIVATED SEGMENT OF VOTERS OUT THERE IN GENERAL. THAT IS ANTI-TRUMP BAN. IT SPEAKS DEMOGRAPHICALLY TO WHAT I HAVE SAID. HIGHER EDUCATED DEMOCRATS ARE SWAMPING THE POLES TO VOTE AGAINST FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. WE HAVE RULES WHERE THERE IS NO PARTY REGULATION AND ANYBODY CAN COME OUT AND VOTE IN THE PRIMARY. THAT PROBABLY BROUGHT OUT SOME VOTERS WHO ALREADY WERE PLANNING TO VOTE FOR BIDEN AND THAT IS A RISK FOR FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IN THE GENERAL ELECTION >>. OKAY, THANK YOU FOR BREAKING THAT. DOWN FOR US COMING UP. WASHINGTON RACES FOR PARTIAL GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN JUST FOUR DAYS AWAY, PREPARING FOR A HIGH-STAKES IT MEETING WITH PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN AT THE WHITE HOUSE, PLUS ONE OF THE CLOSEST ALLIES IN CONGRESS, BACKLASH FROM VOTERS IN MICHIGAN AND BEYOND. AND JIM CLYBURN WILL JOIN ME. >>> WELCOME BACK. >>> WELCOME BACK. FORGIVE ME IF YOU FEEL LIKE. WE JUST DID THIS, BUT THE CLOCK IS TICKING. THERE IS A FRIDAY DEADLINE TO AVOID A SHUTDOWN. PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN WILL MEET AT THE WHITE HOUSE TOMORROW WITH LEADERS TO DISCUSS A PATH FORWARD, IF THERE IS ONE. CHUCK SCHUMER AND MIKE JOHNSON ARE READY, POINTING FINGERS OVER WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE STALL. JOHNSON IS STRUGGLING TO NAVIGATE AN UNRULY HOUSE MAJORITY JOINING ME NOW. ON CAPITOL HILL, WE FEEL LIKE. IT'S A REAL POSSIBILITY AND A PARTIAL GOVERNMENT. SHUTDOWN: HOW DID WE GET HERE AND WHY DOES IT? ONLY AFFECTS SOME DEPARTMENTS >>. THIS IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN UNTIL WE SEE EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY. CONGRESS HAS TO ACT QUICKLY. WE DON'T KNOW IF, WHEN OR HOW THEY WILL AVOID A SHUTDOWN. HOW WE GOT HERE. CONGRESS VOTED THREE TIMES. THEM SPEAKER SAID HE WOULD NOT DO IT IN JANUARY BUT DID WORK. WE HAVE STOPGAP MEASURES IN EFFECT. THERE ARE GOVERNMENT FUNDING DEALS. THEY CAN'T SEEM TO GET IT TOGETHER. WHY IS THIS ONLY PART OF THE GOVERNMENT? BECAUSE THE LAST TIME AROUND THEY GOT AN IDEA FROM MEMBER TO DO THIS. IT'S CALLED A LATHERED CR. PART OF THE GOVERNMENT. SHUTDOWN: AT THE END OF THIS FRIDAY LET'S SHOW THE GRAPHIC, THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY, AGRICULTURE, AND THEN ONE WEEK FROM FRIDAY AT MIDNIGHT, THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE JUSTICE AND OTHER SHUTDOWN. WILL THIS GET BETTER RESULTS? THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN. THE CLOCK IS TICKING. THEY STILL DON'T HAVE A DEAL >>. THERE DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE THE CONSERVATIVE WING BEDDING HERE. IS THERE A STRATEGY HERE? IS THERE A STRATEGY HERE? >>. THERE IS NO MAGIC BULLET. WHAT HE'S DOING IS REMINDING REPUBLICANS THAT THEY DON'T CONTROL THE SENATE OR THE WHITE HOUSE. HE HAS TRIED TO SET EXPECT, PATIENT, SAYING REPUBLICANS WILL HAVE TO SETTLE FOR SINGLES AND DOUBLES. THE REASON REPUBLICANS CARE SO MUCH ABOUT THIS IS IT IS THE CULMINATION OF WHAT RATE WING MEMBERS WANT. HE HAS TO SIGN THIS INTO ACTION AND SOME SEE THIS AS LEVERAGE TO GET POLICY THINGS THAT THEY WANT AND SOME OF THE DEMANDS COMING THAT WE WILL NEVER GET THROUGH THE SENATE. THEIR CUTTING THIS. IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN BUT THEY MUST FIND A WAY OUT WHERE HE CUTS A DEAL SO HIS NUMBERS CAN BE SHOWN TO BE LIVABLE >>. OKAY, JUST A COUPLE OF DAYS TO FIGURE THIS OUT. THANK YOU. JOINING ME NOW IS A SOUTH CAROLINA DEMOCRAT CONGRESSMAN, JIM KLAPPER. TELL ME WHAT YOUR LEVEL OF OPTIMISM IS AND IF THAT IS EVEN THE RIGHT WORD, WHAT IS YOUR MESSAGE TO THE SPEAKER? >>. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. MY MESSAGE IS VERY EASY: COME FORWARD WITH A DEAL OR WE HAVE TO DO ANOTHER STOP GAP RESOLUTION. WE MUST NOT ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT TO SHUT DOWN. WE LOOKED AT THE AGENCY THAT WILL BE AFFECTED. ONE IS VETERANS, AFFAIRS, VETERANS, AFFAIRS. WE CANNOT HAVE THIS. SO COME TOGETHER, PUT A DEAL ON THE FLOOR, STOP THIS NONSENSE. THEN LET'S GO FORWARD [ INAUDIBLE ]. THE PUBLIC KNOWS WELL THAT DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS ARE DOING THIS AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT BEING THE CASE. >>. THE OTHER LEGISLATION THAT REMAINS IS THE PRESIDENT SUPPLEMENTAL REQUEST AND FUNDING FOR ISRAEL AND UKRAINE. THE SITUATION IN UKRAINE IS DETERIORATING. HOW MUCH OF AN EFFORT IS THERE FOR DISCHARGE ADDITIONS TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN? OR IS THERE OTHER LEGISLATIVE PROCEDURES YOUR LOOKING FOR? >>. WE HAVE ALL THE DEMOCRATS VOTING FOR IT. I THE TIME HE GETS TO THAT PART, THERE WILL BE 213 DEMOCRATS AND WE STILL NEED FOUR VOTES FROM THE OTHER SIDE. AND IF THE BILL WERE TO BE PUT IN, I BELIEVE THERE WILL BE FOUR MORE PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE. WHO WILL DECIDE IT? IT WILL PASS THE HOUSE WITH A BIG NUMBER, BIG NUMBER. I DO BELIEVE IT'S SERIOUS. I THINK I KNOW WHAT HE IS THINKING. >>. DO YOU THINK YOU COULD GET EVERY SINGLE DEMOCRAT TO SIGN ON IF AID O ISRAEL IS INCLUDED? SOME HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT THAT. >>. THIS IS ABOUT TRYING TO MOVE A FOREIGN AFFAIRS AGENDA LONG. I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S FOR DEMOCRATS. IF THESE ARE TOGETHER, IT WILL HAVE RESTORED CONFIDENCE TO SOME PEOPLE. PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN MUST LOOK AT THIS DAY IN AND DAY OUT, AND HE IS DOING WHAT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, ALLIES, AND I DO THINK THAT HE WILL GET A SIGNIFICANT VOTE FROM DEMOCRATS, NOT GOING TO SAY EVERYONE WILL VOTE FOR ISRAEL, AS OPPOSED TO WHAT IS GOING ON REGARDING THE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE HOSTAGES. I DO BELIEVE THE VOTES WILL BE THERE. >>. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN EXPECT. PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN, TWO FARE IN MICHIGAN TOMORROW. ARE YOU CONCERNED THAT THE CAMPAIGN NEEDS TO GET DEMOCRATS? CAMPAIGN NEEDS TO GET DEMOCRATS TO GO, GET DEMOCRATS. THE VOTE IS AT PICKING UP ANY MOMENTUM. >>. FROM WHAT I HEAR FROM MY FRIENDS UP IN MICHIGAN, IT IS AN ISSUE. IT IS NOT PICKING UP ANY MOMENTUM. I DO BELIEVE THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO WILL CAST A VOTE ALONG THOSE LINES. I STILL BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN WILL COME OUT OF THIS IN REAL GOOD SHAPE AND THE DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO BE IN A GOOD PLACE. >>. THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT MICHIGAN, WHICH HAS A SIGNIFICANT AIR, IT'S CRITICAL TO THE ELECTION BID. ARE YOU CONCERNED THAT THEY ARE UNCOMMITTED, AND TOMORROW THEY MIGHT GET OUT OF THE ELECTION >> IS A LONG TIME BETWEEN NOW AND NOVEMBER. THE WAY PEOPLE FEEL TODAY- GOOD. THE WAY PEOPLE FEEL TODAY- GOOD CHANGE- I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED- TO MAKE A DEAL. A GOOD DEAL IS MADE TO GET THE HOSTAGES FREE. I BELIEVE THAT THEY WILL BE IN GOOD SHAPE COME NOVEMBER. I DON'T THINK THAT WE CAN MAKE ANY PREDICTIONS TODAY OF HOW PEOPLE WILL VOTE COME NOVEMBER. YOU WANT TO DO THAT. I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OF US WILL FEEL COMFORTABLE. PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN MIGHT GO DOWN. >>. I THINK WE SHOULD ALL HAVE PREDICTIONS. DO YOU HAVE A MESSAGE FOR YOUR CONGRESSWOMAN? SHE HAS BEEN OUTSPOKEN IN THE VOICE TO VOTE UNCOMMITTED. WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO HER? >>. I SAID ALL ALONG THAT WE COULD HAVE MORE, NOT LESS, OF WHAT I EXPERIENCED. I LOOK AT HER EXPERIENCES AND SHE KNOWS A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MY EXPERIENCES. NEITHER ONE OF US HAVE EVER LIVED IN THE OTHER SKIN. I WOULD HAVE NO ADVICE FOR HER, EXCEPT TO SAY: I AM HOPEFUL THAT, WHEN IT IS ALL SAID AND DONE, WE CAN COME TOGETHER, NOT JUST AS A PARTY BUT AS A PEOPLE, AND GET THIS ISSUE RESOLVED. I UNDERSTAND YOUR SENTIMENT. PEOPLE THROUGHOUT MY DISTRICT THAT I HEAR FROM ESPECIALLY YOUNG PEOPLE ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES AND SO VERY SENSITIVE TO WHAT SHE IS FEELING ABOUT THIS AND I UNDERSTAND IT. >>. AND BEFORE YOU GO, I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE REPUBLICAN RESULTS IN SOUTH CAROLINA FROM OVER THE WEEKEND. IT'S A STARTLING RESULT. FROM OUR EXIT BOWL: 36% OF VOTERS BELIEVE THAT BIDEN WON THE 2020 ELECTION. THAT WOULD MEAN THAT 61% SAID NO. WHAT IS YOUR REACTION TO THOSE NUMBERS AND WHAT DOES IT SAY ABOUT THE STATE OF OUR DEMOCRACY? >>. WELL, THAT IS FOR REPUBLICAN PRIMARY VOTERS. 61% OF THEM SAID THAT YOU HAVE TO DEDUCT PEOPLE NOT VOTING IN THAT PRIMARY. >> WHEN YOU PULL REPUBLICANS IN >>. WHEN YOU PULL REPUBLICANS IN THE PRIMARY, THAT IS NOT THE MAJORITY OF AMERICAN PEOPLE. I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT OUR DEMOCRACY. I HAVE BEEN SAYING THIS FOR A LONG TIME. I RAISED THIS BEFORE I DID NOT BELIEVE FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP WAS GOING TO LEAVE THE WHITE HOUSE. PEOPLE CRITICIZED ME THEN THAT I DIDN'T KNOW I WAS TALKING ABOUT. I THINK EVERYBODY NOW SEES WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT WHEN I SAID I CONSIDER TRUMP TO BE OF MUSSOLINIAND WHO AND [ INAUDIBLE ], AND I STILL HOLD TO THAT. PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SEE WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT. OKAY, I HAVE TO LEAVE IT THERE. THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US. AND WE HAVE AN UPDATE NOW ON THE WILD SCOOP FROM MIKE COLLEAGUE ON THE SOURCE OF THE ROBO CALL IMPERSONATING BIDEN'S VOICE TELLING PEOPLE NOT TO VOTE. DURING THE PRIMARY VOTE DURING THE PRIMARY. NOW THE ROBO CALL WAS COMMISSION STREET MAGICIAN WAS HIRED TO CREATE IT. KRAMER EXPRESSED NO REMORSE AND SAID HE DID IT TO DRAW ATTENTION TO THE DANGERS OF AI IN POLITICS. HE RECEIVED A SUBPOENA FROM THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION. HE HAD BEEN WORKING FOR THE PRIMARY AT THE TIME. THE CALL WENT OUT IN JANUARY. >>. UP NEXT. WE SIT DOWN WITH GRETCHEN WHITMIRE, THE PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY, AND WHAT SHE SAYS ABOUT THE POLITICALS ENDINGS THE BATTLE OVER. >>. WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT PEOPLE? >>. WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT PEOPLE CONCERNED ABOUT THE PRESIDENTS AGE? >> HAS MORE EXPERIENCE AND AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS DONE FOR. >>. WHAT YOU SAY TO THE PEOPLE WHO WOULD LIKE A YOUNGER CANDIDATE TO REPLACE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN? >> I WOULD SAY HAVE TO GO TO THE TRAIN STATION. >>. WELCOME BACK. PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN WILL FACE HIS FIRST SWING STATE TEST OF THIS ELECTION CYCLE. DEMOCRATS ARE URGED TO HAVE A VOTE AS UNCOMMITTED. WE ASKED ABOUT THE UNCOMMITTED CAMPAIGN AND IF IT COULD COST THE CANDIDATE IN THIS CRUCIAL CAMPAIGN? >>. DOES PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN HAVE A PROBLEM IN MICHIGAN >>. YOU CAN COUNT ON, THAT IS TRUE. NO, MATTER WHO IS ON THE BALLOT, WE NEED TO STAY FOCUSED ON THIS. I'M GRATEFUL THAT THEIR AGENDA HAS SHOWN PROBLEM-SOLVING AND THE VALUES THAT WE CARE ABOUT, AND THEY ARE MAKING PROGRESS. >>. ARE THEY MORE FOCUSED IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS AFTER VIEWING OTHER DEMOCRATS? AND SHOULD ALARM BELLS BE GOING OFF INTO BIDEN'S CAMPAIGN? >>. YOU CAN'T TAKE THAT FOR GRANTED. WE HAVE OUR PRIMARY EARLIER THAN USUAL AND PEOPLE ARE NOT ACCUSTOMED TO VOTING THIS EARLY. SO WE REMIND PEOPLE: IT IS PRIMARY DAY AND WE HAVE NINE MONTHS OF THE GENERAL ELECTION AND THERE IS A LOT OF GOOD WORK TO BE DONE HERE. >>. SHOULD THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN HAS STAYED MORE FOCUSED ON THIS EARLIER? >> NO, I THINK THAT, AS WE LOOK AT ALL THE STRUCTURES THAT PEOPLE ARE CONFRONTING, THIS GENERATION IS FOCUSED ON GOOD PAYING JOBS AND LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD AND CREATING OPPORTUNITY WHETHER IT IS THE BROADBAND ACROSS MICHIGAN OR SUPPLY CHAI >>. THEIR AGENDA HAS BENEFITED MICHIGAN AND THEY NEED TO FOCUS ON THEM. >>. Reporter. MANY VOTERS ARE FRUSTRATED WITH PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN OVER HIS POLICY IN ISRAEL AND WHAT WOULD BE A STRONG SHOWING IN THIS PRIMARY, SHOWING IN THIS PRIMARY >>. I THINK EVERY PERSON HAS TO MAKE A STATEMENT ABOUT WHAT IS IMPORTANT TO THEM. WE HAVE THE ARAB COMMUNITY AND MUSLIM COMMUNITIES AND THEY ARE NOT ALL ONE IN THE SAME. THERE IS A LOT OF PAIN IN THE JEWISH COMMUNITY. PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO MAKE THEIR VOICES HEARD. >>. UNCOMMITTED SAID. THEY WENT 10,000 VOTES. I THINK THAT IS POSSIBLE >>. IS THE PRESIDENT TAKING THAT SERIOUSLY? >>. THERE ARE 150,000 VOTES OR SO WORK. HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO THE PRESIDENT DIRECTLY ABOUT THAT? >>. I HAVE SPOKEN TO A LOT OF PEOPLE ABOUT IT. I CAME VERY CLOSE. I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A LOT OF DIFFERENT FEELINGS ON THAT AND STRONG WINDS AND PAIN THAT PEOPLE ARE FEELING. I ALSO KNOW THAT WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO IS WORKING 24 SEVEN TO BRING CALM TO THE REGION. I KNOW WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO CARES ABOUT THIS AND BRINGING PEOPLE FROM THIS COUNTRY HOME. HE'S WORKING INCREDIBLY HARD TO RESOLVE WHAT IS HAPPENING >>. IN THE INTERVIEW THE GOVERNOR ALSO ADDRESSED THE SUPREME COURT RULING THAT THE RIPPLE OF FACT WILL GO FAR IS AN EXACT CONSEQUENCE OF THE TRUMP VIEWS OF THE UNITED STATES STATES. WE KNEW THAT IT WAS ONLY KILL ME --. NO ONE SHOULD BE SURPRISED ABOUT THE IDEA OF IMPLICATION. AND GUESS WHAT IF IT GOES THIS FAR? WE DON'T KNOW WHAT COULD BE NEXT. THERE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE, BUT WHO IS AT RISK? WE HAVE BEEN MAKING THAT CASE. AND NOW WE ARE MAKING THAT AND REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING TO DISTANCE THEMSELVES. DISTANCE THEMSELVES >>. HAS PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN BEEN MAKING THAT CASE? >>. YES, HE'S SHOWN THAT. HE IS ABSOLUTELY SUPPORTIVE OF A WOMAN'S ABILITY TO MAKE HER OWN DECISIONS AND RESPECT WOMEN. EVERYTHING FROM EXECUTIVE ORDERS TO THE WORK THAT THEY DO AND THE PEOPLE THEY NOMINATE AND SUPPORT. >>. YOU CAN CATCH MORE REPORTING ON TODAY'S ISSUE OF THE NBC NEWS POLITICS NEWS LETTER FROM THE POLITICS. AND AFTER THE BREAK WHEN RELIGION COURTS AND POLITICS COLLIDE THE CHIEF JUSTICE OF: >>>. WELCOME BACK THE NATIONAL. >>> WELCOME BACK THE NATIONAL. INFERTILITY ASSOCIATION. INFERTILITY ASSOCIATION ANNOUNCED FRIDAY THAT SOME WILL PAUSE FERTILITY TREATMENTS. PAUSE FERTILITY TREATMENTS. CLINICS ARE SUSPENDING SERVICES FOR FEAR OF LIABILITY. HE HAD NO INTENTION OF PROSECUTING DEMOCRATS IN ALABAMA. INTRODUCED A BILL DECLARING THE DEFINITION DID NOT INCLUDE A EMBRYO OUTSIDE OF THE UTERUS. THE DECISION HAS DRAWN ATTENTION TO A ONCE STRANGE RELIGIOUS PHILOSOPHY. AFTER TOM PARKER CLAIM THE BIBLE IS HIS OPINION AND DISCUSSED HIS OPINION OF THE SEVEN MANDATES FOR CONSERVATIVE CHRISTIANS. FOR CONSERVATIVE CHRISTIANS. CANNOT RULE OVER ALL LIFE >>. GOD CREATED [ INAUDIBLE ] AND THE FACT THAT WE HAVE LET IT GO INTO THE POSSESSION OF OTHERS IS HEARTBREAKING. THAT IS WHY HE IS CALLING PEOPLE TO STEP BACK >>. JOINING ME NOW TO TALK ABOUT THIS IS OUR SENIOR INVESTIGATOR AND REAP ORDER MY CAKES. IT IS THE CURRENT UP PINION OF CHIEF JUSTICE THAT HE MAKE REFERENCE TO THE BIBLE. REFERENCE TO THE BIBLE >>. JUST AS PARKER HAS NOT BEEN SHY ABOUT EXPRESSING HIS VIEWS THAT AMERICA WAS FOUNDED AS A CHRISTIAN NATION WHOSE LAWS SHOULD BE ROUTED IN A CONSERVATIVE EVANGELICAL INTERPRETATION OF THE BIBLE, YOU SEE THAT REFLECTED IN HIS OPINION AS HE CITES TWO DOZEN TIMES SCRIPTURE FOR JUSTIFYING THE COURT'S DECISION THAT EMBRYOS SHOULD BE GIVEN THE SAME RIGHTS AS LIVING CHILDREN. SO HE WRITES THAT ALABAMA HAS ADOPT INTERPRETATIONS OF LIFE, AND THEREFORE MUST LOOK TO THE BOOK OF GENESIS THAT SAYS: ALL MEN ARE CREATED IN GOD'S IMAGE. WHEN YOU PUT THOSE TWO TOGETHER, YOU MUST INCLUDE THAT NO LIFE CAN BEAST DESTROYED WITHOUT INCURRING THE LOSS OF A HOLY GOD. AND THAT INCLUDES EMBRYOS. >>. WE ARE SEEING A RISE IN CRITICISM. IS IT MORE ENTERED TWINED WITH REPUBLICAN POLITICS? >>. THEY WANTED TO DEFINE THAT TERM. WE ARE HEARING A LOT. THAT MEANS THE IDEA THAT CHRISTIANS WANT TO SEE THEIR VIEWS REFLECTED IN POLICY. OUR POINT OF THE DEFINITION GIVEN, WHICH IS THE IDEA HAT THE CHURCH IS MEANT TO DIRECT THE GOVERNMENT, THE SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE, IS A MYTH, AND WHAT WE ARE SEEING IS THAT IDEA. THE MANDATE YOU MENTIONED IN THE CENTER OF GOP POLITICS AND IT WILL BE PROLIFERATING SINCE FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP WAS IN POWER, AND WHAT WAS ONCE SEEN AS A FRINGE OF IN EVANGELICALISM >>. >> THEY ARE SUPPORTED BY. IS THIS THEOLOGY RUNNING CONTRARY TO HOW THEY BELIEVE? >>. DOES THAT INCLUDE FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP? >> HE SPOKE AT GALA TETHERING OF CHRISTIAN BROADCASTERS, WHERE HE PROMISED TO MANY WHO SHARE THE VIEWS EXPRESSED THAT HE WOULD GIVE THEM UNPRECEDENTED POWER IN THE NEW ADMINISTRATION. AND IT IS BECAUSE OF THE FEDERAL JUSTICES THAT WERE APPOINTED BY FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO TEST THOSE COMMENTS AND DISTANCE THEMSELVES WITH THE OTHER PROMISES AND ACTIONS. >>. THANK YOU FOR THAT REPORT. WE APPRECIATE IT. >>>. FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AND PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN GO HEAD TO HEAD AT THE BORDER ON THURSDAY. WHAT DO WE EXPECT AS THE DUO? >>> WELCOME BACK. >>> WELCOME BACK. AND ANOTHER SIGN THAT PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN AND FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP HAVE THEIR EYES ON A REMATCH BOTH. MEN WILL VISIT THE SOUTHERN BORDER ON THURSDAY. TRUMP IS VISITING EAGLE PASS. THE WHITE HOUSE IS TRYING TO. THE WHITE HOUSE IS TRYING TO TURN THE TABLES ON THE ISSUE. A NEW MONMOUTH UNIVERSITY POLL SHOWS: 84% OF AMERICANS SAY ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM, INCLUDING 61% WHO SAY IT IS A VERY SERIOUS. TROUBLE HIM BUYS PERCENTAGES EVER REPORTED ON THAT ISSUE. >>. WE ARE JOINED NOW BY THE. >>. WE ARE JOINED NOW BY THE PANEL. SO IS THIS JUST PROVES THAT WE? SO IS THIS JUST PROVES THAT WE ARE GOING TO SEE THE PRESIDENT AND THE FORMER PRESIDENT ON THE SOUTHERN BORDER IN A COUPLE OF DAYS. IS THIS PROOF THAT THE PRIMARIES ARE BASICALLY OVER? >>. I THINK SO. FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AND PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: NO, THERE WILL BE A STEAMY CONTEST THIS YEAR. IT IS BECOMING A NATIONAL ISSUE, NOT JUST AN ISSUE IN CORE STATES BUT VOTERS IN EVERY STATE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THIS SOMETHING. THAT BIDEN WAS TO TRY TO GIVE THAT UP >>. YOU SOUGHT IN THE SPECIAL ELECTION. THERE WAS A MESSAGE. LEANING INTO IMMIGRATION AND REPUBLICANS ARE BACKING AWAY FROM THIS BIPARTISAN DEAL IS A RISK TO HIGHLIGHT BORDER SECURITY >>. IN SOME WAYS HE IS OUTRANKING TRUMP ON THE ISSUE. YOU HAVE TO GO AND SHOW PEOPLE THAT YOU ARE ADDRESSING THE BORDER AND YOU CARE ABOUT IT. NOT AN ISSUE THAT YOU WILL NEGLECT AND YOU CAN'T LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT WHILE YOU'RE DOING IT. YOU ARE PORTRAYING THAT, AND YOU HAVE IMMIGRATION REFORM AND YOU BRING BOTH OF THOSE TOGETHER AND IT GOES DOWN TO THE BORDER AND THEY HAVE TO HAVE DIFFERENT VISIONS >>. YOU CAN JUST GO ONE WAY. FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IS WRONG ON THIS. >>. IS IT ENOUGH TO FOCUS ON THIS? SHOULD HE FOCUS MORE ON THINGS LIKE REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS? >>. IT'S ALSO WHAT YOU ARE HOPING FOR AND GETTING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WANT TO VOTE ON THIS. YOU HAVE TO DECREASE THAT, AND WHAT YOU ARE HOPING FOR IS A LARGE NUMBER TO SAY: I DON'T SEE IT AS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE >>. LISTEN TO WHAT OUR MICHIGAN >>. LISTEN TO WHAT OUR MICHIGAN REPORTERS SAID. >>. THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION PUT THIS ON THE TABLE. THE BEST SOLUTION OFFERED IN DECADES WAS ON THE TABLE AND THE REPUBLICANS WALKED AWAY. I THINK IT IS APPARENT THAT, BECAUSE THERE IS A PARTY MORE INTERESTED IN SCORING POLITICAL POINTS THAN SOLVING A PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE SOLVED >>. THE IDEA WAS THAT THEY SHOULD NOT GIVE BIDEN A WIN. IS THIS EFFECTIVE? >>. IT MIGHT BE. I THINK THIS COULD EVOLVE IN WASHINGTON, AND THE QUESTION IS WHETHER IT WILL RESONATE. THERE IS NOT A LOT OF ROOM TO GO. ONE POLL, AFTER POLL SHOWS THAT PUBLIC OPINION IS STRONG ON THE BORDER. THIS IS NOT ABOUT WINNING. THIS IS NOT ABOUT WINNING. THIS IS NOT A FABRICATION ISSUE. THEY SAY REPUBLICANS HAVE FABRICATED IMMIGRATION. WILL ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. KNOW THIS IS REAL. FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IS PRESENTING HIMSELF AS THE PROBLEM. HAVE A PLAN TO FIX THIS PROBLEM AND YOU ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT IT. I THINK IT IS REAL. THERE ARE MIGRANTS AT THE BORDER. THE NUMBERS ARE OVERWHELMING, NOT JUST BORDER CITIES BUT SANCTUARY CITIES. I THINK THERE IS FEAR MONGERING FROM THE RIGHT WHEN THERE COMES TO THEIR BEING CRIMINALS AND DRUGS AND SOME OF THAT. THAT PEAKS PHOBIA. IT CAN BE POLITICAL POSTURING. I THINK THERE IS ROOM IF WE LOOK AT THE ACTUAL PROBLEMS AND WHAT ARE THE ACTUAL SOLUTIONS AND WHAT CAN GET DONE. THAT IS WHERE BIDEN SAYS: I AM TRYING TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM AND REPUBLICANS ARE NOT WILLING TO NEGOTIATION. >>. THERE IS A WAY TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM >>. EVERYBODY IS SAYING: GET TOUGH ON DRUGS. THE PROBLEM IS THE NUMBERS ARE OVER FLOWING. I AM SURE THEY CAN DO JUSTICE QUITE FRANKLY WHEN ISSUE IS THAT CORPORATE EXPLOITATION. YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO COME IN FRONT AND THEY SAY: IT'S CHEAP LABOR AND I CAN DRIVE DOWN WAGES OF AMERICAN WORKERS. I THINK THERE IS ALWAYS BEEN A. I THINK THERE IS ALWAYS BEEN A MESSAGE FOR DEMOCRATS TO BE COMFORTABLE. WE WHAT THAT I WANT TO SAY. THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION IS MISSING AN OPPORTUNITY. THEY WERE LEASING SOME DETAINED MIGRANTS AND THEY COULD NOT AFFORD TO HOUSE THEM BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE FEDERAL FUNDING TO SUPPORT IT. PART OF THE BILL IS PROVIDING DIFFERENT LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. THE ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO FUND THEM FEEL LIKE IT IS LOST IN THE COVERAGE. THAT WAY, THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION CAN DO A BETTER JOB JOB >>. YES, I DO A LOT OF WORK WITH MAYORS. THEY ARE ALL SAYING: WE NEED HELP THEIR PEOPLE COMING IN AND WE WANT TO BE WELCOMING BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO IT. IT ULTIMATELY COMES DOWN TO COST. IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A CONTRACT, THE REPUBLICAN COMMITTEE IS READY TO TAKE IT ON. OKAY, WE HAVE LESS THAN TWO MINUTES, BRENDAN. HOW SOON WILL WE BE LOOKING AT FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. >>. I DON'T KNOW PART OF ME DOES NOT SEE THIS HAPPENING. I KNOW HE IS PRAGMATIC, IS PROBABLY ON HIS WAY OUT BEFORE TOO LONG. DON'T KNOW. IF YOU WOULD WANT TO DO THAT, YOU CAN'T EVEN SAY HIS NAME. HE COULD COME AROUND. >>. WE ARE HEARING THAT FROM SO MANY REPUBLICANS. NIKKI HALEY SET ALL THESE THINGS ABOUT HOW PROBLEMATIC FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IS, AND HE IS WRONG ON SO MANY ISSUES HERE HERE. THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US.",[52]
281,GkWha5al8Sk,Meet the Press NOW â€” Feb. 27,NBC News,2024-02-27 23:45:00+00:00,"WE WILL HAVE MUCH MORE HEAD ON MEET THE PRESS WHICH STARTS: RIGHT NOW, RIGHT NOW. >>. [ MUSIC ]. >>> WELCOME TO MEET THE PRESS NOW. I AM ETER ALEXANDER, HERE IN WASHINGTON. AS WE LIKE TO SAY AROUND THESE PARTS, IF IT IS TUESDAY, VOTERS ARE VOTING SOMEWHERE. TODAY THAT SUMMER IS THE STATE OF MICHIGAN A KEY BATTLEGROUND. THIS ALL WHERE REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ARE HOLDING PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARIES AND WILL POST THAT BOAT TO THE LIKELY NOMINEES IN BOTH PARTIES ARE ALSO TAKING CENTER STAGE FIRST. THE REPUBLICAN SIDE: THIS IS THE SECOND DONALD TRUMP VERSUS NIKKI HALEY MATCHUP IN FOUR DAYS, WITH HALEY LOOKING TO SOLIDIFY THAT 40% OF THE ANTI- TRUMP VOTE AS WE HEAD INTO SUPER TUESDAY, JUST ONE WEEK FROM TODAY. ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE, THE PROTEST VOTE AGAINST PRESIDENT BIDEN IS NOT A RIVAL CANDIDATE BUT RATHER A VOTE OF O CONFIDENCE. MICHIGAN PRIMARY VOTERS ARE ALLOWED TO CAST UNCOMMITTED BALLOTS, AND MANY ACTIVISTS WITH ROOTS IN THE SIZABLE ARAB AND MUSLIM COMMUNITIES IN MICHIGAN ARE PUSHING MICHIGANDERS TO VOTE UNCOMMITTED AS A WAY TO PROTEST THE PRESIDENT'S HANDLING OF THE ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR. PROGRESSIVES HAVE BEEN RATCHETING UP THEIR PRESSURE ON THE PRESIDENT TO STOP BACKING ISRAEL'S MILITARY CAMPAIGN IN GAZA AND WHILE NOT THE PERMANENT CEASE-FIRE THEY WANT. PRESIDENT BIDEN SET A POSITIVE INFIGHTING: COULD BE COMING SOON >>. WELL, I HOPE BY THE END OF THE WEEKEND. MY NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR TELLS ME THAT WE ARE CLOSE. WE ARE CLOSE, NOT DONE. YET, MY HOPE IS, BY NEXT MONDAY WE WILL HAVE A CEASE-FIRE. >>. ORGANIZERS SAY THE UNCOMMITTED CAMPAIGNS GOAL IS 10,000 VOTES TODAY, BUT THAT NUMBER WOULD ACTUALLY BE SMALLER THAN WHAT IS CONSIDERED A TYPICAL UNCOMMITTED TURNOUT IN THE STATES DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY. CHECK THIS OUT. MICHIGAN'S LAST DEMOCRATIC PRIMARIES ALL SAW ABOUT 20,000 UNCOMMITTED BALLOTS IN EACH CYCLE EVEN WHEN IT WAS NOT AN ORGANIZED CAMPAIGN PUSHING PEOPLE TO VOTE. THAT WAY, PRESIDENT BIDEN WON MICHIGAN IN NOVEMBER 2020,, BY THE WAY, BY MORE THAN 100,000 VOTES STILL TODAY COULD REALLY HIGHLIGHT WHAT IS A POLITICAL LIABILITY FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN AT THE MOMENT THAT OTHER VULNERABILITIES ARE ALSO ON DISPLAY. THAT INCLUDES HIS HANDLING OF THE CRISIS AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER WITH MEXICO, AN ISSUE THAT DONALD TRUMP CLEARLY WANTS TO TRY TO MAKE CENTRAL TO HIS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. A NEW MONMOUTH POLE AS 61% OF ADULTS CALLING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM THAT INCLUDES 41% OF DEMOCRATS AND 58% OF INDEPENDENTS. PRESIDENT BIDEN IS SCHEDULED TO HEAD TO THE BORDER ON THURSDAY, WHERE HE IS CERTAIN TO PUT ASIDE HOUSE REPUBLICAN EFFORTS TO TRY TO BLOCK A BIPARTISAN BORDER- SECURITY AND FOREIGN AID BILL, THE 81-YEAR-OLD PRESIDENT IS ALSO CONTINUALLY FIGHTING CONCERNS OVER HIS AGE, AND HERE IS HOW HE TRIED TO BRUSH ASIDE THOSE CONCERNS YESTERDAY AT A LATE-NIGHT APPEARANCE: >> YOU ARE CURRENTLY 81 YEARS OLD. >>. WHO TOLD YOU THAT? >> HOW DO YOU ADDRESS THAT CONCERN GOING FORWARD AS YOU COME UP TO THE 2024 ELECTION? >> A COUPLE THINGS NUMBER ONE. THE OTHER GUY IS ABOUT HOW OLD I AM, ABOUT HOW OLD I AM. THIS IS A GUY WHO WANTS TO TAKE US BACK ON ROE V WADE, A WHOLE RANGE OF ISSUES, AND I REALLY THINK HIS VIEWS ON WHERE TO TAKE AMERICA ARE OLDER THAN -- ANYWAY -- >>. PART OF PRESIDENT BIDEN'S CONVERSATION JUST YESTERDAY WITH SETH MEYERS ON NBC. MIKE IS ON THE GROUND IN DEARBORN, MICHIGAN, THE HEART OF THAT STATES ARAB-AMERICAN POPULATION. MICHAEL, IT IS A VOTING DAY ON BOTH SIDES BUT UNCOMMITTED ORGANIZERS APPEAR TO MANAGE THE EXPECTATIONS WITH THE 10,000 VOTE TARGET. HOW LIKELY BASED ON YOUR REPORTING THERE, IS IT A HIT, THAT TOTAL WHAT ARE THOSE ON THE GROUND TELLING YOU X PETER, SIMPLY ON THE HISTORICAL TRACK RECORD, IT IS LIKELY THE UNCOMMITTED VOTE WHAT WILL BE MORE THAN THOSE THEY'RE CAREFULLY MANAGED EXPECTATION OF 10,000.. THIS IS SUCH AN UNUSUAL PRIMARIES. SO FAR, THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY, PRESIDENT BIDEN, WASN'T EVEN ON THE BALLOT- 90% OF THE VOTE- AND IN NEVADA, NO ONE REALLY KNOWS WHERE THIS IS GOING TO END UP HERE IN MICHIGAN. PART OF THAT IS ALSO BECAUSE THIS IS THE FIRST TIME MICHIGAN IS VOTING IN THIS EARLIER WINDOW. IT IS NOTABLE THAT THIS WAS MICHIGAN'S MOVE INTO THE EARLY WINDOW WAS MEANT TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE STRAKES OF PRESIDENT BIDEN, WITH BLACK VOTERS AND UNION MEMBERS INSTEAD. IT HAS JUST PUT A REAL SPOTLIGHT ON HIS HANDLING OF FOREIGN POLICY, A CONCERN MANY DEMOCRATS HAVE OVER HIS SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL AND A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS THAT WE ARE SEEING IN GAZA. THAT HAS BEEN FRONT AND CENTER WITH SOME OF THE VOTERS WE HAVE BEEN TALKING TO TODAY. TAKE A LISTEN >>. WHAT MADE US COME OUT AND VOTE TODAY, I THINK, IS THE DESIRE FOR PEACE, THE DESIRE TO PUT PRESSURE ON THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION FOR A CEASE-FIRE >>. NEED TO BE SHIFTED. >> NEED TO BE SHIFTED. [ INDISCERNIBLE ]. CHILDREN HAVE PASSED AWAY. MURDER IN THIS CASE INNOCENTLY. THAT SHOULDN'T BE THE RESULT. [ INDISCERNIBLE ]. HIS DECISION SHOULD HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE BEGINNING OF THE WAR >>. SO, PETER, WE ARE STARTING TO GET THAT RUSH-HOUR SURGE OF THE VOTING HERE, WHERE WE ARE, IN DEARBORN. IT IS INTERESTING. MICHIGAN DOES HAVE SOME NEW LAWS MAKING IT EASIER TO VOTE EARLIER IN ABSENTEE. AND THE MICHIGAN SECRETARY OF STATE SAID, BEFORE POLLS EVEN OPENED TODAY, 1 MILLION BALLOTS HAD BEEN CAST IN BOTH PRIMARIES AND NOTABLY, SHE SAID, THERE HAD BEEN STRONG TURNOUT IN ANN ARBOR. YOU KNOW MICHIGAN, YOU KNOW THAT GEOGRAPHY OF ANN ARBOR. THAT IS A COLLEGE TOWN AND THERE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT ACTIVISM AMONG YOUNG VOTERS, IN PARTICULAR ABOUT GAZA. IMPORTANT TURNOUT, IMPORTANT TURNOUT >>. YOU AND I HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS ALL DAY PRIVATELY BUT NOW THAT WE ARE ON CAMERA TOGETHER HAVING THIS CONVERSATION, I WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU ARE HEARING, HOW SERIOUSLY THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN IS TAKING THIS PROTEST. IS THERE A LEVEL OF CONCERN THAT THIS REALLY HAS IMPLICATIONS THAT GO WELL BEYOND THE PRIMARY? >>. OF COURSE, THESE CONVERSATIONS ARE MORE FUN OFF CAMERA BUT FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONVERSATION, WITH A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE WATCHING LISTEN, THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN IS CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT THEY ARE SEEING. TODAY THEY ARE ALSO DOWNPLAYING IT. THEY SAY WE ARE HEARING THESE VOTERS, BUT THERE HAVE BEEN EFFORTS ON THE PART OF THE CAMPAIGN TO SEND TOP OFFICIALS- MAYBE NOT THE PRESIDENT, HE HAS ONLY COME HERE ONCE- BUT OTHERS TO HEAR THE CONCERNS. IT WAS INTERESTING TALKING TO THE MICHIGAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY CHAIRWOMAN TODAY SHE SAID OU CAN TELL THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN LISTENING TO THESE CONCERNS BECAUSE OF THE COMMENT HE MADE YESTERDAY, ICE CREAM CONE IN HAND, TALKING ABOUT A CEASE- FIRE BEING LIKELY. THEY ALSO HAVE DRAWN A DISTINCTION BETWEEN A PRESSURE CAMPAIGN NOW TO TRY TO INFLUENCE THE PRESIDENTS FOREIGN POLICY AND WHAT THESE VOTERS WILL DO IN NOVEMBER. THEY SAY THOSE VOTERS WILL BE BEHIND THE PRESIDENT WHEN IT COUNTS IN NOVEMBER. A BIG QUESTION THOUGH WE WILL SEE. >>. MIKE STAY SAFE ON THE TRAIL. WE WILL TALK A LITTLE BIT LATER. MY FRIEND JOINING US NOW IS MICHIGAN DEMOCRATIC STATE REPRESENTATIVE, THE MAJORITY LEADER IN THE MICHIGAN HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES BACKING THE UNCOMMITTED CAMPAIGN IN THE STATE. WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR BEING WITH US. I WANT TO ASK YOU OUT OF THE GATE. LAST WEEK, ORGANIZERS WERE SHOOTING FOR ABOUT 20,000 UNCOMMITTED VOTES. TODAY WE ARE HEARING 10,000.. THE GOAL FOR THE UNCOMMITTED CAMPAIGN. WHAT WOULD YOU VIEW AS SUCCESS? >>? I THINK SUCCESS WOULD BE RECORD TURNOUT. IF YOU LOOK AT THE CONCERNS OF THE DEMOCRATIC COALITION AND MULTIRACIAL, MULTI-RELIGION COALITION WE BELIEVE THE UNITED STATES SHOULD NOT BE FUNDING WAR. THE UNITED STATES SHOULD NOT BE BACKING ANY INITIATIVE THAT IS KILLING ANY INNOCENT MAN, WOMAN AND CHILD, AND WE HAVE SEEN THAT HAPPEN OVER THE LAST 140 DAYS. TONIGHT WE ARE EXPECTING TO HAVE A VERY STRONG SHOWING AND WE WILL SEE THAT ONCE THE POLLS CLOSE. WE SAW A RECORD TURNOUT [ INDISCERNIBLE ] AND WE ARE GOING TO SEE THE RESULTS OF THAT. >>. JUST TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THAT: RECORD TURNOUT FOR RECORD, TURNOUT OVERALL FOR THE UNCOMMITTED NUMBER, THE 10,000 GOAL THAT WAS SET WAS OBVIOUSLY WELL BELOW THE NUMBER IT HAS BEEN IN THE PAST. JUST TO BE CLEAR, FOR WHOM ARE YOU LOOKING TO SEE A RECORD AND WHAT DOES THAT RECORD NEED TO BE? >>. WE WANT TO SEE PEOPLE TURN OUT AND VOTE. I THINK THAT IS THE ULTIMATE GOAL. >> NOT FOR THE UNCOMMITTED >>. [ INDISCERNIBLE ]. LOVE AS SOMEBODY. [ INDISCERNIBLE ]. I WILL SAY YOU ARE GOING TO SEE A NUMBER OF FOLKS VOTING UNCOMMITTED, [ INDISCERNIBLE ] >>. LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT WHAT GOVERNOR WHITMER TOLD US ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S HANDLING OF THE CONFLICT JUST YESTERDAY. I WILL PLAY THAT FOR OUR AUDIENCE. >>. I HAVE SPOKEN WITH THE PRESIDENT. I HAVE SPOKEN WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE ABOUT IT AND I KEEP VERY CLOSE TO OUR ARAB- AMERICAN COMMUNITY. I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A LOT OF DIFFERENT FEELINGS AND STRONG ONES AND PAIN THAT PEOPLE ARE FEELING AND I ALSO KNOW THAT WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO IS WORKING 24/7 TO TRY TO BRING CALM TO THE REGION AND PEACE TO THE REGION. HE IS, I THINK, WORKING INCREDIBLY HARD TO RESOLVE WHAT IS HAPPENING. >> HE IS WORKING INCREDIBLY HARD TO RESOLVE WHAT IS HAPPENING. DO YOU ACCEPT THAT ASSESSMENT? >>. HE CERTAINLY HAS NOT DONE ENOUGH WHEN HE SEES 30,000 DEAD INNOCENT MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN GAZA. AND YOU SAW THAT THE PRESIDENT FOR THE LARGE PART OF THIS WAR DID NOT SPEAK OUT FORCEFULLY AGAINST THE DEHUMANIZATION OF THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE. IT IS ONLY NOW THAT WE ARE SEEING A SHIFT IN THE MESSAGING AND THAT IS LARGELY BECAUSE OF THE ORGANIZING EFFORTS WE HAVE DONE HERE IN MICHIGAN AND THE CONVERSATIONS WE HAVE HAD WITH THE WHITE HOUSE. >>. TO BE CLEAR, DO YOU THINK HE IS RESPONDING TO YOUR CONCERNS [ INDISCERNIBLE ] DURING THEIR VISIT? >> MORE THAN HAVING MEETINGS BUT WE NEED TO SEE -- THE WHITE HOUSE MUST ACT ON THIS ISSUE. WE HAVE BEEN VERY CLEAR: A PERMANENT CEASE-FIRE, ENDING THE FUNDING OF THESE BOMBS THAT ARE KILLING INNOCENT MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN, AND RESTORING MANAGER IN AID TO THE PEOPLE IN GAZA. THAT HAS BEEN OUR MISSION FROM THE START. WE WILL KEEP PUSHING FOR THAT. WE HAVE YET TO SEE THAT HAPPEN. >>. YESTERDAY THE PRESIDENT SAID HE IS HOPEFUL, THERE COULD BE A CEASE-FIRE. HE WAS SPECIFIC. HE SAID BY MONDAY, IF THERE IS A CEASE-FIRE OR IF THIS WAR ENDS BEFORE NOVEMBER, DO YOU BELIEVE UNCOMMITTED VOTERS IN MICHIGAN WILL BE WILLING TO VOTE FOR THE PRESIDENT OR IS THAT RELATIONSHIP, IN YOUR VIEW, IRREPARABLY DAMAGE? >>. YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT AS TRANSACTIONAL AS MANY PEOPLE WANTED IT TO LOOK LIKE IT IS NOT. IF YOU HAVE A CEASE- FIRE, YOU STOP THE KILLING. WHAT WE ARE SAYING IS: THE PRESIDENT HAS NOT LISTENED TO THE CALL OF THE MAJORITY OF AMERICANS, 70+ PERCENT OF DEMOCRATS, 50+ PERCENT OF AMERICANS WHO HAVE SAID. WE DO NOT WANT THE UNITED STATES TO FIND ANYMORE. THAT IS GOING INNOCENT- MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN. SO WE ARE PUSHING BACK ON THAT. WE ARE HOPING THE PRESIDENT WILL HEED THE CAUSE OF HIS CONSTITUENCY. THAT IS THE MOST DEMOCRATIC THING TO DO. WE ARE USING THE SELECTION TODAY TO SEND THAT MESSAGE. SO THAT COME NOVEMBER, THERE IS NOT A CONVERSATION AROUND ARE THERE STILL PEOPLE IN PALESTINE UNDERGOING A GENOCIDAL CAMPAIGN BY BENJAMIN NETANYAHU? >>. SO TO BE CLEAR, THE PRESIDENT RIGHT NOW SAYS: ISRAEL HAS GONE OVER THE TOP IN ITS ACTIONS. THERE HE HAS BEEN TRYING TO PUT MORE PRESSURE ON THEM. OBVIOUSLY, THAT IS NOT SUFFICIENT WITHOUT A CEASE-FIRE FOR YOU. BUT JUST TO BE CLEAR, WHAT SPECIFICALLY DO YOU NEED TO SEE TO FEEL SATISFIED THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE DIRECTION OF NOT JUST WHAT ARAB AND MUSLIM AMERICANS SAY, BUT NUMBER OF AMERICANS ARE SAYING RIGHT NOW QUESTION: >>. WE HAVE BEEN VERY CLEAR, RESTORING MANAGER AND EIGHT ENDING THE UNCONDITIONAL FUNDING TO ISRAEL AND BENJAMIN NETANYAHU'S RADICAL REGIME AND A PERMANENT CEASE-FIRE TO USHER IN PALESTINIAN STATEHOOD AND SAFETY AND SECURITY FOR ALL WHO LIVE IN THE REGION. IT IS NOT COMPLICATED. WE ARE ASKING THE UNITED STATES TO LEAD WITH MORAL CLARITY AND TO STOP FUNDING ANY INITIATIVE THAT IS KILLING INNOCENT MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN WHICH WE HAVE SEEN. 30,000 PALESTINIANS HAVE NOW SUFFERED THROUGH AND UNFORTUNATELY, EVERY HOUR THAT GOES THERE. MORE PALESTINIANS DIED AND THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE. THAT THE US IS FINDING THAT >>. YOU TOLD POLITICO RECENTLY. IT IS INSULTING WHEN PEOPLE TELL ARAB AND MUSLIM COMMUNITIES THAT IF YOU DON'T SUPPORT BIDEN, YOU ARE EFFECTIVELY SUPPORTING FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP. IF THAT IS THE BALLOT IN NOVEMBER, ISN'T THAT SORT OF THE WAY ULTIMATELY, THAT IT WOULD BE WORKING. IF YOU ARE NOT SUPPORTING BIDEN, YOU WOULD BE SUPPORTING THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN >>. TODAY, WE ARE SUPPORTING AN UNCOMMITTED EFFORT TO ALLOW THE PRESIDENT TO CHANGE COURSE ON THIS ISSUE. LOVE, MY UNCLE WAS KILLED IN AN AIR STRIKE THREE DAYS BEFORE THE TRAVEL BAN. IF ANYBODY KNOWS THE PERSONAL PAIN OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S POLICIES, IT IS PEOPLE LIKE ME, PEOPLE LIKE MY COMMUNITY. WE RECOGNIZE THE DANGER OF DONALD TRUMP. I KNOW HE IS A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY. THE QUESTION HAS TO BE ASKED TO THE CANDIDATES, NOT TO THE VOTERS. WHAT IS PRESIDENT BIDEN WILLING TO DO TO PROTECT AND SAVE DEMOCRACY? IS HE GOING TO LISTEN TO THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE OR WILL HE CONTINUE TO BE A PACIFIST AND ALLOWING BENJAMIN NETANYAHU TO DICTATE WHATEVER RETURNS HE WANTS? THAT RESULTS AND KILLING 30,000 PEOPLE? THE QUESTION IS FOR THE PRESIDENT. WE STAND WITH DEMOCRACY AND NOT GENOCIDE. >>. SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOU, MICHIGAN REPRESENTATIVE. I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOU SPENDING YOUR TIME TO SHARE YOUR PERSPECTIVE. IT IS TRUMP VERSUS HALEY IN MICHIGAN REPUBLICAN PRIMARY VOTE TODAY. DELEGATES ARE ON THE LINE. THANKS TO SOME CANDID AND CONFUSING ROLES IN THIS CONTEST, AS WELL AS SOME INTERNAL REPUBLICAN CHAOS. NBC'S JACK BREWSTER IS ON THE GROUND IN GRAND RAPIDS, MICHIGAN, WITH WHAT AND WHERE HE IS WATCHING TONIGHT FIRST. MICHIGAN IS ALSO SAID TO BE THE LAST PRIMARY FOR SUPER TUESDAY, WHICH TRUMPS ARRIVAL. NIKKI HALEY IS PUTTING HER HOPES ON. WHAT ARE YOU HEARING FROM VOTERS THERE AND WHAT THEY ARE LOOKING FOR? >>. WELL, THEY ARE COMING OUT FOR DIFFERENT REASONS HERE. I WILL TELL YOU. SOME PEOPLE SAY THIS IS A RAW POLITICAL CALCULATION. SOME FOLKS HAVE AID. THEY ARE SUPPORTING NIKKI HALEY, TOLD ME THEY ARE ONLY DOING SO AS A METHOD AND MEANS TO STOP DONALD TRUMP. I HAVE HEARD FROM SUPPORTERS COME OUT AND SAY THIS IS ABOUT THE ISSUES FOR THEM. THEY LIKED WHAT THEY SAW UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LEADERSHIP AND THEY WANT HIM BACK IN THE WHITE HOUSE. AND I HEARD FROM FOLKS WHO ARE SUPPORTING PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN THEY POINT TO THE ECONOMY THE OVER PERFORMING ECONOMY. THEY SAY THEY WANT MORE OF THAT LEADERSHIP AND THEY THINK HE IS THE ONLY OPTION TO FIGHT THIS BATTLE AGAINST TRUMP. I BELIEVE WE HAVE SOME SOUND FROM SOME OF THE VOTERS THAT I HAVE BEEN TALKING TO. LET'S TRY TO PLAY SOME OF THAT NOW. >> BEEN TRADITIONALLY A REPUBLICAN, BUT THE LAST YEAR HAD ME LEANING MORE TOWARDS DEMOCRAT. >>. WHY DIDN'T YOU VOTE FOR BIDEN THIS TIME? >>. I FEEL IT IS MORE IMPORTANT AT THIS POINT TO LET PEOPLE KNOW THAT THERE IS AN KNOW, THAT THERE IS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. I AM ALMOST EMBARRASSED WITH SOMETIMES. >>. YOU SAY THAT AS A REPUBLICAN. >>. EXACTLY, I AM A MODERATE REPUBLICAN. THE PARTY IS LEAVING ME >> AND THIS IS A UNIQUE PART OF THE STATE. WE ARE IN KENT COUNTY- A SWING COUNTY AS OF LATE, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THESE RECENT CYCLES. IT IS A PLACE. NIKKI HALEY IS HOPING TO HAVE A STRONGER PERFORMANCE THAN WHAT YOU WOULD SEE STATEWIDE, AT LEAST ACCORDING TO SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT I TALKED TO. YOU DO HAVE SOME PEOPLE COMING OUT BECAUSE OF HER ATTENTION IN THIS AREA. ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE, THERE IS ALSO A PRIMARY BUT THE DELEGATE ALLOTMENT WORKS A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY. THERE WALK US THROUGH HOW THE GOP HANDLES IN MICHIGAN >>. I THINK THEY ARE TRYING TO CONFUSE ALL OF US. PETER POINT, IF YOU LOOK AT THE DELEGATES, YOU KNOW THAT 55 DELEGATES ARE UP FOR GRABS IN THIS PRIMARY BUT ONLY 16 OF THOSE DELEGATES WILL BE ALLOCATED, BASED ON THE RESULTS OF WHAT YOU SEE AT THE POLLS TONIGHT, THE REST. THE 39 REMAINING DELEGATES WILL BE ALLOCATED AT STATE CONVENTIONS PLURAL THAT WILL TAKE PLACE ON SATURDAY BOTH IN GRAND RAPIDS AND DETROIT. WHY ARE THERE? MULTIPLE CONVENTIONS THERE ARE CURRENTLY DUELING OR RIVAL OR COMPETING LEADERS OF THE STATE REPUBLICAN PARTY. YOU HAVE THE FORMER LEADER WHO STILL HAS CONTROL OF THE EMAIL LIST AND WEBSITE. SHE IS HAVING A CONVENTION IN DETROIT AND YOU HAVE THE TRUMP BACK TO LEADER A FORMER REPRESENTATIVE HAVING THE CONVENTION IN GRAND RAPIDS. IT IS VERY CONFUSING, VERY COMPLICATED BUT BY THE END WE WILL KNOW HOW THIS ALL SHAKES OUT. EQUALLY CONFUSING- IT IS 71 DEGREES AND LATE EVERY IN GRAND RAPIDS, MICHIGAN. WE WILL SAVE THAT CONVERSATION FOR ANOTHER TIME. IT IS MUCH BETTER THAN MY EXPERIENCES COVERING THE CAMPAIGN THIS TIME OF YEAR. THERE HAVE FUN. WE WANT TO TURN NOW TO STEVE. HE IS AT THE BIG BOARD. STEVE, WHAT ARE YOU WATCHING IN TONIGHT'S RESULTS? >>? OKAY, A COUPLE BIG STORY LINES HERE ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE, THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE- WHERE TO WATCH TONIGHT? I WILL START ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE HERE, BECAUSE THE QUESTION IS: IS DONALD TRUMP CLEARLY HAD A BIG ADVANTAGE? HOW WELL CAN NIKKI HALEY DO HERE? COULD SHE HIT THAT 40% NUMBER? SHE GOT IN SOUTH ATLANTA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE. IF SHE DOES SOMETHING LIKE THAT, WHERE TO LOOK FOR IT? MOST IS RIGHT IN THIS AREA- KENT COUNTY, WHERE GRAND RAPIDS IS. THAT'S WHERE HOLLAND IS, AND THERE IS A REGION HERE THAT, COMBINED, MAKES UP ABOUT 17% OF ALL THE REPUBLICAN VOTES. THAT IS ABOUT ONE OUT OF EVERY SIX. WHAT MAKES THIS REGION SO UNIQUE TO WATCH TO SEE HOW HALEY IS DOING? THIS IS THE MOST TRUMP RESISTANT PORTION OF THE STATE IN THE 2015 REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY. IT IS A TRADITIONALLY REPUBLICAN AND CONSERVATIVE AREA. BUT IN 2016,, WHEN TRUMP WAS RUNNING THE IRST TIME, HE GOT 37% OF THE VOTE IN THE MICHIGAN PRIMARY, NOT SO IN KENT COUNTY. IN KENT COUNTY IN 2015,, HE GOT 23%. NEXT DOOR 19%- ABOUT ALMOST HALF OF WHAT YOU GOT STATEWIDE. THIS WHOLE AREA HERE WAS A HUGE WEEK SOURCE FOR DONALD TRUMP IN 2016.. IS IT AGAIN TONIGHT? IS IT A SOURCE OF STRENGTH FOR HALEY IN TERMS OF THE DEMOCRATIC RACE HERE? CALL THAT UP ON THE SCREEN. GO BACK TO STATEWIDE HERE. THE STORY LINE HERE IS BIDEN. THIS IS WHAT WORRIES THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN. UNCOMMITTED ACTIVISTS WHO OPPOSED BIDEN'S POLICY ON ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR ARE ENCOURAGING DEMOCRATS TO VOTE UNCOMMITTED AS A PROTEST TO JOE BIDEN. IF IT IS GETTING ANY TRACTION TONIGHT, WE CAN LOOK IN TWO BIG CASES FOR IT: WAYNE COUNTY AND THE CITY OF DEARBORN, MICHIGAN. WITH OVER 100,000 RESIDENTS, IT IS MAJORITY ARAB-AMERICAN HAS THE LARGEST CONCENTRATION OF MUSLIM AMERICANS PER CAPITA OF ANY CITY IN THE COUNTRY. SO TAKE A LOOK AT WAYNE COUNTY AND IN PARTICULAR DEARBORN TO SEE THE UNCOMMITTED ALSO NEXT DOOR UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, EASTERN MICHIGAN UNIVERSITY. WE HAVE SEEN A LOT OF ACTIVATION ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES AGAINST JOE BIDEN'S POLICY ON ISRAEL AND HAMAS. WE HAVE CERTAINLY SEEN POLLING THAT SHOWS YOUNGER COLLEGE-AGE VOTERS ARE MOST OPPOSED TO THAT POLICY. LOOK IN THIS COUNTY TO SEE IF THAT SEGMENT OF VOTERS IS ACTUALLY TURNING OUT AND CHECKING OFF THE UNCOMMITTED OPTION HERE. IF YOU ARE NOT SEEING IT IN THOSE TWO PLACES, YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT SEEING IT ANYWHERE STEVE. THANK YOU SO MUCH. COMING UP NEXT YEAR, AN OVAL OFFICE SIT DOWN WITH PRESIDENT BIDEN'S MEETING WITH MIKE JOHNSON AS WASHINGTON TRIES TO AVERT A PARTIAL GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN THAT COULD HAPPEN AS EARLY AS THE END OF THIS MEET. >>>. WELCOME BACK, PRESIDENT. >>>. WELCOME BACK PRESIDENT BIDEN HOSTED THE TOP FOUR CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS AT THE WHITE HOUSE TODAY AS LAWMAKERS SCRAMBLE TO TRY TO AVERT A PARTIAL GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN BY THE END OF THIS WEEK. RIGHT NOW THE PRESIDENT TELLING THOSE LAWMAKERS AT THE WHITE HOUSE IT'S CONGRESS'S RESPONSIBILITY TO FUND THE GOVERNMENT, WARNING THAT A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN WOULD DAMAGE THE ECONOMY SIGNIFICANTLY. FOLLOWING THEIR MEETING THERE WAS CAUTIOUS, BIPARTISAN OPTIMISM FROM BOTH SPEAKER JOHNSON AND FROM BOTH SPEAKER JOHNSON AND THE LEADER THAT THE SHUTDOWN COULD BE AVOIDED. JOHNSON ALSO TOLD REPORTERS. HE ENGAGED IN A SEPARATE ONE-ON ONE MEETING BRIEFLY WITH THE PRESIDENT IN THE OVAL OFFICE. ROLLING OVER ALL OF THIS IS THE PRESIDENT'S EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL REQUEST FOR FOREIGN AID. THAT HAS BEEN STALLED IN CONGRESS FOR MONTHS AND IT REMAINS A MAJOR POINT OF CONTENTION ON CAPITOL HILL. >>. THE MEETING ON UKRAINE WAS ONE OF THE MOST INTENSE I HAVE EVER ENCOUNTERED IN MY MANY MEETINGS IN THE OVAL OFFICE. I SAID IT HAS BEEN AROUND HERE A LONG TIME, MAYBE FOUR OR FIVE TIMES. THAT HISTORY IS LOOKING OVER YOUR SHOULDER AND IF YOU DON'T DO THE RIGHT THING, WHATEVER THE IMMEDIATE POLITICS ARE, YOU WILL REGRET IT >>. THERE WAS DISCUSSION ABOUT THE SUPPLEMENTAL SPENDING PACKAGE AND I WAS VERY CLEAR WITH THE PRESIDENT AND ALL THOSE IN THE ROOM THAT THE HOUSE IS ACTIVELY PURSUING AND INVESTIGATING ALL THE VARIOUS OPTIONS ON THAT AND WE WILL ADDRESS THAT IN A TIMELY MANNER. BUT AGAIN, THE FIRST PRIORITY OF THE COUNTRY IS OUR BORDER AND MAKING SURE IT IS SECURE. THAT'S JOINING ME NOW IS [ INDISCERNIBLE ]. WALK US THROUGH THIS. I WAS THERE LISTENING TO REMARKS FROM BOTH, A DEMOCRAT AND REPUBLICAN LEADERS. THERE DID THIS MEETING FROM YOUR REPORTING AT THE WHITE HOUSE. MOVE THE BALL ON GOVERNMENT FUNDING. WHAT ARE THE KEY STICKING POINTS THAT NEED TO BE SORTED OUT ON THAT AS WE REACH THIS WEEK'S DEADLINE. >>. MOVES THE BALL A LITTLE BIT. PETER. THE VIBES WERE POSITIVE COMING OUT OF THIS WHITE HOUSE MEETING. EVERYONE SEEMS TO BE IN AGREEMENT THAT THEY ARE MOVING TOWARDS THE RESOLUTION HERE MIKE JOHNSON TALKED ABOUT HOW THEY ARE WORKING IN GOOD FAITH TO RESOLVE IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, LITERALLY WORKING AROUND THE CLOCK. SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER FLOATED THE POSSIBILITY THAT YET ANOTHER STOPGAP MAY BE NECESSARY TO PREVENT THE SHUTDOWN ON FRIDAY. [ INDISCERNIBLE ], SAYING SIMPLY THAT THEY ARE GETTING CLOSER, GETTING CLOSER. HE FEELS THEY CAN GET THIS DONE. THE BIGGEST STICKING POINT, PETER, IS THE POLICY. I DON'T [ INDISCERNIBLE ] LARGELY SETTLED THE TOPLINE AMOUNT IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH THE GOVERNMENT WOULD SPEND DUE TO A HOLDUP IN PRIOR GOVERNMENT FUNDING BILLS. THAT HAS BEEN RESOLVED. THE HOLDUP NOW HAS BEEN LARGELY HOUSE REPUBLICAN DEMANDS FOR CONSERVATIVE POLICY MEASURES AND, OF COURSE, DEMOCRATS IN THE SENATE AND PRESIDENT BIDEN ARE NOT WILLING TO ACCEPT A LOT OF THE DEMANDS THAT HOUSE REPUBLICANS ARE PUTTING FORWARD. SO WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE US? THERE ARE JUST A LITTLE OVER 72 HOURS UNTIL THE FRIDAY NIGHT AT MIDNIGHT, DEADLINE. THAT DOESN'T LEAVE MUCH TIME TO THAT DOESN'T LEAVE MUCH TIME TO GET THIS DONE IN TIME. EVEN IF THEY WERE TO RELEASE -- CLOSE THE DEAL AND RELEASE THE BILL TONIGHT, THEY WOULD HAVE TO MOVE VERY, VERY QUICKLY AND HOPE THE SENATE GETS IT DONE. THAT IS PROBABLY THE SINGLE BIGGEST OBSTACLE TO AVERTING A SHUTDOWN IN TIME. THEY WOULD HAVE TO NOT ONLY STRIKE THE DEAL BUT ALSO PASS IT THROUGH BOTH CHAMBERS OF COURSE. THIS IS JUST PART OF THE GOVERNMENT, PETER. THIS IS A MARCH 1st DEADLINE FOR CERTAIN AGENCIES, LIKE VETERANS AFFAIRS, THE MARCH 8th DEADLINE FOR OTHER PARTS OF THE GOVERNMENT. LIKE THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, THAT WILL BE EVEN TOUGHER THAN THIS PROTECTS THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE. WE GET TO DO THIS ALL OVER AGAIN. I WANT TO ASK YOU: SUPPLEMENTAL? THAT IS THE MONEY FOR UKRAINE FOR THE END OF PACIFIC, SPECIFICALLY TAIWAN FOR ISRAEL, ALSO DISCUSSED IN THIS MEETING AT THE WHITE HOUSE. I WAS LISTENING TO THIS AND IT DIDN'T SOUND LIKE SPEAKER JOHNSON WAS ANY CLOSER TO PUTTING THIS ON THE FLOOR FOR A VOTE. HE WAS STILL FOCUSED VERY HEAVILY ON TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING FOR THE BORDER BEFORE HE WOULD EVEN CONSIDER THAT. NO, BUT, THAT IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. PETER STILL VERY MUCH UP IN THE AIR. SPEAKER JOHNSON IS STILL NOT MAKING ANY COMMITMENTS. FOREIGN AID PACKAGES, INCLUDING UKRAINE FUNDING, WELCOME TO THE FLOOR IN PART, BECAUSE GOVERNMENT FUNDING IS A PRIORITY. HE IS FACING THREATS TO HIS JOB FROM HIS SPEAKERSHIP, FROM THE HARD RIGHT REBELS, IF HE WERE TO ALLOW THIS TO PASS. THIS HAS BEEN A RALLYING CRY IN THE MAD WING OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. THIS IS CLEARLY THE MOST TENSE PART OF THAT WHITE HOUSE MEETING, BECAUSE EVERYONE ELSE IN THE ROOM, INCLUDING PRESIDENT BIDEN, INCLUDING ALL THE LEADERS ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE AND MIKE JOHNSON, WERE IN FAVOR OF UKRAINE EIGHT. MIKE JOHNSON HAS NOT MADE ANY COMMITMENT [ INDISCERNIBLE ]. HE WILL REGRET IT FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE. >>. LAWMAKERS, RIGHT NOW, JUST WANT TO ALLOW FOR A VOTE AND SEE HOW MANY DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS WOULD JOIN. THEY FEEL VERY STRONGLY. THEY WOULD HAVE ENOUGH VOTES TO HAPPEN BUT MIKE JOHNSON HAS TO ALLOW THAT HAPPEN BUT, RIGHT NOW, HE'S NOT GOING TO ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN. AFTER THE BREAK, WE ARE ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL AS NIKKI HALEY PUSHES TO STAY IN THE RACE AS: >>. WELCOME BACK VOTERS ARE. >> WELCOME BACK VOTERS ARE VOTING TODAY IN MICHIGAN, NIKKI HALEY'S CAMPAIGN IS ALREADY LOOKING. PAST THIS BUT A WEEK FROM NOW, SUPER TUESDAY, IN COLORADO, ONE OF MORE THAN A DOZEN STATES HOLDING CONTESTS. A WEEK FROM TODAY, A POOR SHOWING FOR HALEY REALLY COULD MEAN THE END OF HER CAMPAIGN. TRAVELING WITH THE HALEY CAMPAIGN HAS THE VERY LATEST FROM CENTENNIAL COLORADO, FROM CENTENNIAL COLORADO ALLIE >>. HEY PETER, FROM COLORADO, WHERE NIKKHALEY IS CONTINUING HER SPRINT THROUGH THE SUPER TUESDAY FINISH HERE. SHE HELD TWO EVENTS IN MICHIGAN, DEPARTING THAT STATE JUST AS VOTERS WERE OFFICIALLY HEADING TO THE POLLS ON THE MICHIGAN FRONT. IT IS ONE OF THE STATES THAT THE HALEY CAMPAIGN OFTEN LOOKS AT AND SAYS: THIS IS ONE OF THE STATES I HAVE MET DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS AND INDEPENDENTS, WHO ARE NO FAN OF TRUMP SHOWING UP AT THE HALEY EVENTS IN DETROIT AND GRAND RAPIDS. THOSE ARE EXACTLY THE KIND OF VOTERS THAT I AM ALSO MEETING HERE IN OUTSKIRTS OF DENVER. AS HALEY AGAIN MAKES THAT SIMILAR PITCH, THE IDEA THAT SHE IS THE MORE ELECTABLE CANDIDATE IN A GENERAL ELECTION AGAINST PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. AS WE HAVE SAID BEFORE AND WE WILL NEED TO SAY AGAIN, YOU DON'T GET TO GENERAL WITHOUT FIRST GETTING TO THE PRIMARY FOR HALEY. THE REALITY OF THAT BECOMES SLIMMER AND SLIMMER BY THE DAY. THE REPUBLICAN APPARATUS REALLY READY TO MOVE ON AND PUT THEMSELVES OUT OF THE PRIMARY ELECTION POSTURE AND INTO A GENERAL ELECTION POSITIONING WITH TRUMP AS THE NOMINEE. BUT I HAVE GOT TO TELL YOU. VOTERS I HAVE SPOKEN TO IN MICHIGAN AND COLORADO SAY THEY WANT TO SEE NIKKI HALEY CONTINUED TO STICK IT OUT AND FIGHT. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT HALEY WANTS TO HEAR. AS SHE SAYS SHE IS GOING TO BE GETTING VOTERS AN ALTERNATIVE ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE CALENDAR, AT LEAST THROUGH SUPER TUESDAY >>. A JOINING US NOW OUR PANEL: EUGENE DANIELS, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, CORRESPONDENT. WE ALSO BROUGHT EUGENE ROBINSON AT THE WASHINGTON POST. ALSO, NBC NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST ERIC CHAMBERLAIN IS WITH US AS WELL. I HOPE YOUR MIDDLE NAME IS NOT NEW GM- OUR FRIEND EUGENE SCOTT. LET ME START WITH YOU. HALEY IS ARGUING: RIGHT NOW, 40% OF THE VOTES SHE GOT. THAT IS A BIG ISSUE. THAT DONALD TRUMP SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT. RIGHT NOW THE FACT: HE IS THE INCUMBENT ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE. HOW CONCERNED SHOULD THE TRUMP FOLKS BE ABOUT THAT? DOES SHE HAVE A POINT THERE? >>. THEY SHOULD BE VERY CONCERNED. MAINSTREAM REPUBLICANS. THAT IS THE GROUP HE IS LOSING: SUBURBAN, WELL-EDUCATED PEOPLE. I THINK THEY COULD COME BACK AROUND. HE CERTAINLY LIKED HIS POLICIES. THE ISSUE THEY HAVE WITH HIM IS HIS PERSONALITY AND SOME OF THE THINGS HE SAYS. >> I WANT TO GET YOUR TAKE ON THAT, AS WELL. THE 40% FIGURE FEELS LIKE A LOT BIDEN IN SOUTH CAROLINA. GOT 95, 100%. THAT THE PERCENTAGE OF HALEY VOTERS SAY THEY WILL NOT VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP. SOMETHING LIKE 25% OF REPUBLICAN PRIMARY VOTERS ARE SAYING THEY WON'T VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP NOW. I EXPECT A LOT OF THOSE REPUBLICANS TO COME HOME. BUT WHAT IF JUST HALF OF THEM COME HOME? >> [ INDISCERNIBLE ] >> 10, 12% IN THE REPUBLICAN VOTE. THAT IS A PROBLEM, SO >>. SO LET ME GET YOUR TAKE ON THIS EUGENE. THE CURRENT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, JOE BIDEN, RIGHT NOW IS IN THE STATE OF MICHIGAN. HE SPOKE WITHIN THE HOUR TO THE DEMOCRATIC MICHIGAN LEADER, ABRAHAM, AND HE WAS MAKING THE ARGUMENT THAT THE ARAB AND MUSLIM AMERICAN COMMUNITY IS BASICALLY NEED TO HEAR MORE FROM THIS PRESIDENT. NOT THAT THEIR DECISION IS MADE UP RIGHT NOW BUT THEY NEED TO SEE MORE ACTION FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. BUT WHAT KIND OF ALARM BELLS ARE SOUNDING AT THE WHITE HOUSE AND AT THE CAMPAIGN IN WILMINGTON? GIVEN THE UNCOMMITTED QUESTION MARK. WE ACTUALLY SEE PRETTY DECENT NUMBERS FROM THEM BUT THEY DON'T SEEM OVERLY CONCERNED [ INDISCERNIBLE ]. IT SHOWS CRACKS IN WHAT COULD BE THE FACE OF THE PARTY COME NOVEMBER. THE SAME PROBLEM THAT TRUMP IS GOING TO HAVE WITH BOTH MAINSTREAM REPUBLICANS THIS PRESIDENT IS GOING TO HAVE WITH ARAB AMERICAN, MUSLIM AMERICAN VOTERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. MICHIGAN IS THE FIRST PLACE WHERE THEY CAN TEST THAT. AND MICHIGAN ALREADY HAS THIS ENERGY OF UNCOMMITTED. I THINK NO MATTER WHAT THE NUMBER IS, THE MESSAGE BEATS JOE BIDEN. THEY ARE PAYING A LOT OF ATTENTION TO MESSAGE THAT. >>. THE HALEY FOLKS AND THE UNCOMMITTED FOLKS, BOTH CANDIDATES FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP AND BIDEN LOOK LIKE THEY ARE ERODING VOTES ALL OVER THE PLACE. >> [ LAUGHTER ] >>. YEAH, IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THE BEST PERIOD FOR THESE TWO CANDIDATES RIGHT NOW, ONCE WE GET INTO THE ACTUAL GENERAL ELECTION. ONE ASSUMES THAT DEMOCRATS WILL COME HOME TO BIDEN AND REPUBLICANS WILL TEND TO COME HOME TO TRUMP, AND WE WILL SEE WHO IS LEFT OVER. THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN, JUST IN TERMS OF TONIGHT. IT IS HARD TO HAVE LIKE A BENCHMARK. YOU KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO BE: AN IMPRESSIVE, UNCOMMITTED VOTE, BECAUSE THERE IS NOTHING TO REALLY --. I WAS LOOKING BACK AT PREVIOUS RESULTS IN 2012,, WHEN OBAMA WAS THE INCUMBENT. THOSE WERE CAUCUSES: NOT A PRIMARY BUT UNCOMMITTED -- AGAINST A POPULAR INCUMBENT >> THAT IS THE WRONG OBAMA. >>. DON'T BE SURPRISED. I WOULD THINK ANYTHING BELOW THAT WOULD BE A HUGE VICTORY. >>. AS WE LOOK AHEAD TO THURSDAY, THERE IS ALWAYS A BATTLEGROUND AND OTHER BORDER. YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE BIDEN AND TRUMP SHOWING UP TO THE BOARD ON THE SAME DAY. IMMIGRATION IS AN ISSUE, THEY THINK THEY HAVE ADVANTAGES ON. DONALD TRUMP THINKS IT IS A NO BRAINER. AN ISSUE FOR HIS CAMPAIGN THINGS TO MANY UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS. COME INTO THE COUNTRY. JOE BIDEN SAYS: WE GAVE A LOT OF CONCESSIONS ON A BIPARTISAN BORDER DEAL, AND YOU GUYS ARE THE PROBLEM HERE. WHO HAS THE ADVANTAGE? >>. I ACTUALLY STILL THINK THE REPUBLICANS DO. YOU GUYS WILL DISAGREE WITH ME. I AM SURE THEY GAVE US SOME CONSENSUS, BUT NOT ENOUGH. THEY'RE STILL ALLOWING 5000 PEOPLE TO COME OVER EVERY DAY. THEY WERE GOING TO MOVE WHERE YOU HAVE THE TRIALS, TO TEXAS, THE MOST LIBERAL COURT IN THE COUNTRY, TO PUT THE IMMIGRANTS THROUGH. THERE IS KIND OF A JOKE >>. I THINK REPUBLICANS HAVE THE UPPER HAND HERE BECAUSE OF THE MESSAGING. THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS NOT TALKED ABOUT OR REALLY WANTED TO WORK ON IMMIGRATION AS MUCH AS THEY SAY THEY WANTED TO. THEY HAVEN'T DONE MUCH ON IT BUT THE REPUBLICANS HAVE, OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN, USED IMMIGRATION AND UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS. AND ONCE YOU HAVE THAT BASE -- TURNING IT INTO A STRENGTH BY TURNING IT INTO A STRENGTH BY SAYING: LOOK, WE GAVE YOU THE BILL AND YOU CAN ARGUE ABOUT THE MERITS OF THE BILL. AND IF IT IS -- BUT IT IS FURTHER. >>. YES, SOME ARE SUPPORTIVE OF IT. >>. YES, >>, THIS IS NOT A LIBERAL RIGHT, THIS IS NOT A LIBERAL ON IMMIGRATION. SO I THINK I JUST WONDER WHY THEY ARE NOT LEANING SNOW IT MORE >>. THEY NEVER LEAN INTO ANYTHING >> WELL >> SORRY. >> WELL, THERE IS THAT. >> THERE IS THAT >>. SHE MAKES A GOOD POINT. MESSAGING IS A REAL THING FOR THE WHITE HOUSE. THE PRESIDENT, OR NOT UNABLE TO FOCUS ON HIS AGE, DELIVERING A CLEAN SOUND BITE- THIS IS WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO WORK THEIR WAY THROUGH. >>. THEY TALKED ABOUT IT FOR YEARS. THEY HAVE FAILED TO TELL THEIR STORY TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THERE IS ALWAYS A KICK START. WE ARE GOING TO DO IT NOW AND IT NEVER HAPPENS. OR IT HAPPENS AND IT IS NOT CONSISTENT. THAT IS WHERE REPUBLICANS ARE BETTER AT MESSAGING, BECAUSE WHEN THEY HAVE A MESSAGE, THEY STICK WITH IT ACROSS THE ECO SYSTEM. THAT IS NOT SOME. THE DEMOCRATS, OR THE WHITE HOUSE, HAS DONE WELL >>. IT WILL BE AN INTERESTING COUPLE OF DAYS. WE HAVE MORE THAN SIX MONTHS TO GO RIGHT NOW. ISRAEL WAS NOT EVEN A TOPIC SIX MONTHS AGO. >> RIGHT >>. GET READY FOR THE WHOLE CONVERSATION TO TWIST AND TURN AS WE GO FORWARD. THANK GOODNESS. YOU WERE HERE TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR ALL OF US TO KEEP TRACK. THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US THIS HOUR.",[52]
282,xOqh-4THhF8,Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on border crisis and Trump's immigration policy,ABC News,2024-03-06 03:30:01+00:00,"the governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, Republican Governor there, thanks so much for joining us on this super Tuesday. Governor, uh, let's get right to it, you are. I want to talk a little bit about policy here. you're on The Cutting Edge of what voters say is one of the top issues in this election: immigration. and president Trump has, you know, pledged as a policy matter that, if reelected, he would immediately launch the largest domestic Mass deportation operation in US history as AIDS. are talking about using the military setting up Mass deportation camps in Texas. do you support that? do you think the American people support that? so what Donald Trump supports doing is actually enforcing the laws of the United States of America that already exist, that Joe Biden could enforce if he wanted to, but he's not doing it. and what president Trump will do uh is even more than what he did during his first term in office, and that is, he will use every tool available to him to: one, actually secure the Border. two, to deny illegal entry. three, to send back to countries those who came across illegally. and then, four, or by doing so, establish a legal Asylum and immigration process, as opposed to the? uh storming the the gates uh that exist right now, especially by people who are criminals, by people who are known terrorists. we are dealing with extraordinary dangers today that have never existed in this country before, with known terrorists coming across our border and and Joe Biden is doing absolutely nothing about it. Donald Trump will change all of that and restore normaly to our immigration process. okay, first a couple things. um, thank you for that answer, but one thing: you, you, you paint this incredibly dark picture of the people that are coming across the border. you know- you're the governor of Texas- that the vast majority of people are not terrorists. they aren't. they aren't criminals and Thugs and rapists. sure, it's a large group of people, so they're going to be some bad people, but aren't most of them basically like, like my ancestors or my mother-in-law, who came from Indonesia for a better life? not lawfully, and that's the issue, the policy issue. but why paint such a broad Rush targeting all these people as evil and and and and deranged? you need to update yourself about what actually is going on in the Border, because the as the governor of Texas, I deal with this every single day, and there was a time, like with my wife's family, who is Hispanic, where people came across the border and became citizens, or maybe your family, which I'm unfamiliar with, but what's happening today is very different than what happened with your family or Generations before. the people who know that the best are the people who did immigrate here legally, who are very angry about the people who try to come across the border illegally. but also- I know this because of my work both with the Texas Department of Public Safety and with the Texas National Guard- the Texas Department of Public Safety is arresting people who are on the terrorist watch list. they are arresting people who wanted for murder. they're arresting people who came to Texas and committed murder. there were was a murder that took place in Washington State today. there was the murder of the uh student in at the University of Georgia. uh, there was been assaults across the entire country. not a day goes by without an American being assaulted, it seems by somebody who came across the border illegally with Joe Biden's permission, and that's why this is the number one issue in America. think about this. why are Americans so up in arms about this issue and why is it the number one issue? because of the catastrophe caused by Joe Biden? no, no, no question. the. it seems that youed there saying it's- seems every day somebody's being murdered. it's doing a lot of work, but I I want to talk about a word that you use a lot to describe what's happening at the border and, as I say, you're the responsible public official for so much of that border. you call it an invasion. last week a federal judge appointed by Ronald Reagan said surges and immigration do not constitute an invasion under the Constitution. James Madison himself said that uh, invasion is an operation of War, a military operation, and I want to get to the effect of that kind of rhetoric. in your state, the white government, who killed 23 people in El Paso, Hispanic people- cited this Invasion idea as a motive. don't you think that a it's wrong as a matter of law to say that the United States is being invaded by people walking across the border unarmed and that this is inflammatory and people get hurt by it? now to to be clear what James Madison said during the, the ratification conventions, the one that took place in Virginia. uh, Madison made clear to the Virginia convention uh, that Smugglers off the coast of Virginia at that time uh could be attacked or defended against by the militia of Virginia. what Texas is dealing with are Smugglers here at the cartels. so the point is that Texas is dealing with cartels who are smuggling people across our border, just as Madison was talking about how Virginia was dealing with Smugglers off the shore of Virginia. the similarities are are are very, very close, and hence what Madison was talking about, about the in invasion, is exactly about what we're dealing with here in the state of Texas, which is exactly why I am using that language contained in the United States Constitution that authorizes states to use their militia, as James Madison said we could, to defend ourselves from an evasion when the federal government refuses to do so, which which is it is refusing to do so? a federal judge has already said that it's not an invasion under the Constitution. my, my question: harmm that kind of language can do? yeah, thank you sure to clarify you on that. so, anyway that that federal judge, the, the fifth circuit federal court of appeals, has put a stay on that one single federal judges ruling and the, the FED, fifth circuit federal court of appeals, is going to be taken it up and the- the verbiage is not intended uh, to to uh ril up people to commit crimes. Texas, let me be clear about this: Texas is a Law and Order State and we will go after anybody who harms anybody else. if, if you're an American citizen and you come to the St of Texas to try to harm somebody, we will arrest you and put you in jail. same thing goes for any of our fellow Texans. all right as the Border. one more quick question, run out of time here, on another subject: a lot of attention to Alabama Supreme Court decision concering concerning IVF. you describe yourself as a pro-life, uh, Governor. does Life Begin a conception for you, and are fertilized embryos in those clinics human beings? so what? what Texas has done in our law uh, and a law that I actually signed, uh, it Exempted uh fertilized embryos uh from the abortion laws in the state of Texas. but more importantly here uh, is the statement that President Trump put out uh, and that was one that supports uh, invitro fertilization, and it's a position that's supported by majority of Americans. all right, Governor Greg Abbot of Texas, we thank you for being with us. thanks very much. good luck, oh and uh, and we appreciate you being here. and I should just ask H, how does the uh, how does the lieutenant governor's race look there? sure, thank you all. yeah, thank you. thanks very much. all right, you too. hi everyone, George Stephanopoulos here. thanks for checking out the ABC News YouTube channel. if you'd like to get more videos, show highlights and watch live event coverage, click on the right over here to subscribe to our Channel. and don't forget to download the ABC News app for breaking news alerts. thanks for watching.",[37]

THIS MONTH TWO OF THE NATION'S LARGEST PHARMACY CHAINS WILL SELL THE ABORTION PILL IN THEIR STORES. CBS AND WALGREENS SAY THEY HAVE BEEN FDA CERTIFIED. THE CHAINS WILL NOT PROVIDE THE PILL VIA MAIL. WE HAVE A RESEARCH ASSISTANT, PROFESSOR AND FACULTY DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH CENTER AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. HOW BIG OF A CHANGE IS THIS? >>. YEAH, THANKS FOR HAVING ME. IT HAS BEEN A HIGHLY REGULATED DRUG BY THE FDA SINCE IT WAS APPROVED IN 2000.. IN THE PAST IT WAS REQUIRED TO BE GIVEN TO IA PATIENT BY THEIR PROVIDER IN PERSON. DECADES OF RESEARCH ON THE SAFETY HAS PROMPTED THE FDA IN RECENT YEAR TOSSUP DATE THE REGULATIONS AND ALLOW IT TO BE MAILED TO PATIENTS OR FOR PHARMACIES TO FILL THE PRESCRIPTION. DURING THE COVID PANDEMIC, SOME PROVIDERS BEGAN TO WORK WITH MAIL ORDER PHARMACIES. BUT THIS ANNOUNCEMENT FROM CV S AND WALGREENS, YOU CAN WALK IN AND FILL THE PRESCRIPTION. >>. THERE IS OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF MISINFORMATION ABOUT ABORTION PILLS. IT WAS PROMPTED BY THE SAFETY REVIEW TO ALLOW THIS CHANGE. HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN IN USE AND WHAT ARE THE SAFETY CONCERNS? >>. Reporter. IT HAS BEEN APPROVED SINCE 2000 BY THE FDA. JUST A LITTLE CONTEXT ON IT: THE TWO MEDICATIONS THAT ARE USED, WIDELY AVAILABLE IN PHARMACIES AND PRESCRIBED FOR A RANGE OF CONDITIONS INCLUDING MISCARRIAGE, MANAGEMENT AND ABORTION. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THEY, IN COMBINATION, HAVE BEEN USED TO TREAT MISCARRIAGE IN THE PAST AND THAT IT IS AVAILABLE FOR TREATING AND PROVIDING MEDICATION ABORTION. SO REALLY, YOU KNOW, THERE HAS BEEN A LONG HISTORY OF RESEARCH ON THE SAFETY. A REVIEW OF STUDIES FOUND: 90% OF PATIENTS HAVE NO SERIOUS COMPLICATIONS >>. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT PRESIDENT BIDEN. HE SAID THAT THIS APPROVAL FOR CVS AND WALGREENS IS HUGE. HOW THERE ARE REQUESTS OF THE PHARMACIES. THERE HAS TO BE AN AGREEMENT, CERTIFIED PRESCRIBERS, AND YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME. YOU KNOW PAPERWORK THAT SHOWS YOU HAVE THE AGREEMENTS WITH THESE PRESCRIBERS. REALLY, IT IS JUST PAPERWORK, AS OUR RESEARCH HAS SHOWN. IN CHICAGO, WHERE WE TALK TO PHARMACISTS AROUND THE COUNTRY ABOUT THEIR WILLINGNESS AND READINESS TO DISPENSE IT AND REALLY, PHARMACISTS, THEY ARE COMFORTABLE WITH IT. THEY FEEL READY TO DISPENSE THE MEDICATION >>. THE BACKDROP IS A LARGER ABORTION DEBATE, THE ONGOING LEGAL BATTLE OVER MIFEPRISTONE AND THE APPROVAL IS BEING CHALLENGED. SO TALK TO US ABOUT- I GUESS, PUT IT INTO CONTEXT- WITH THAT CHALLENGE BEING BROUGHT ALL OF THE WAY UP TO THE HIGHEST COURT IN THE LAND >>. YEAH, DEFINITELY THERE IS A LOT OF CONSIDERATIONS RIGHT NOW AND YOU KNOW, AS YOU SAID, THIS CASE WILL BE HEARD BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT LATER THIS MONTH. AND REALLY, WHAT THE COURT WILL BE CONSIDERING IS IF THEY ENTIRELY REMOVE THE APPROVAL THAT THE FDA GRANTED BUT SEEMS LESS LIKELY BUT THEY ARE CONSIDERING TO ROLL BACK THE REGULATIONS THAT IT WOULD NO LONGER BE AVAILABLE IN A CERTIFIED PHARMACY SETTING. WHAT THAT WOULD MEAN IS THAT PATIENTS WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK TO SEEING THEIR PROVIDERS IN PERSON IN THE CLINIC. THEY WOULD HAVE TO STOCK IT IN THE CLINICS IN THEY WANTED TO PROVIDE THAT CARE. WE HAVE DONE OTHER RESEARCH AT OUR INSTITUTION WITH FOLKS THAT WORK IN PRIMARY CARE SETTINGS OR HEALTH SETTINGS THAT SAID THEY WOULD BE REALLY INTERESTED IN PROVIDING THEIR PATIENTS WITH EARLY ABORTION OR EARLY MISMANAGEMENT OF MISCARRIAGE CARE IN. IF THEY COULD WRITE A PRESCRIPTION IN THE PHARMACY, YOU WOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE LEGISTICAL CHALLENGES.","[92, 390]"
284,rRp2lsz5FEA,Chuck D on new push for health care pricing transparency,CBS News,2024-03-06 18:03:50+00:00,">>>. MEDICAL DEBT IS ONE OF THE LEADING CAUSES OF BANKRUPTCY AND AMERICA NOW- ROCK AND ROLL, HALL OF FAME OR CHUCK D AS WELL AS OTHERS- ARE TEAMING UP TO BRING AWARENESS OF PRICE TRANSPARENCY IN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. PART OF A PUSH TO GET MEDICAL COMPANY IS TO SHARE MEDICAL INFORMATION WITH THEIR PATIENTS. I'M SO GLAD YOU ARE HERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH. A LOT OF THE VIEWERS WILL KNOW THAT I GREW UP IN CANADA, RIGHT WHERE THERE IS A PUBLIC HEALTH CARE SYSTEM FILING FOR BANKRUPTCY BECAUSE OF AN UNFORTUNATE ACCIDENT, BECAUSE YOU SOUGHT PREEMPTIVE CARE TO GET AHEAD OF A MEDICAL ISSUE. IS IT SEEMS SO BACKWARDS TO ME? I'M CURIOUS WHEN I SAW THE LIST OF PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THIS AND IT'S AN ORGANIZATION CALLED POWER TO THE PATIENTS. HOW DID YOU GET INVOLVED? WHY DID THIS IGNITE IN INTEREST IN YOU? >>. YOU KNOW IT'S IMPORTANT THAT ARTISTS SPEAK FOR THE PEOPLE. YOU ALWAYS SEE IT. YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE FANATICAL ABOUT ART AND WHATEVER BUT WHEN THE CASES ARE REAL PEOPLE DOING REAL THINGS, SOMETIMES IT'S BEST TO CONNECT TO THAT AND IT'S ALMOST LIKE. IT COMES TO A MOMENT, A CRITICAL MOMENT, WHERE HIP-HOP AND RAP MUSIC HAD ITS 50th YEAR, LAST YEAR, SO POWER TO THE PATIENTS SOUGHT. THERE WAS A CONNECT OF RAPPERS, WHO REALLY EVERYBODY WAS LIKE. HOW DO WE CONNECT WITH IT OR WHATEVER INNOVATIVE IN ITS APPROACH TO FINDING THE FACES AND VOICES THAT WOULD SPEAK INTO PEOPLE SO MANY YEARS AND CONNECT THEM TO A CAUSE THAT HAS LEVELED MUCH OF AMERICANS OVER THE PAST 25 TO 30 YEARS? TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A POINT OF THE TRANSPARENCY OF COURSE, LEVELING IT OUT TO THE POINT WHERE YOU KNOW ESTIMATES ARE JUST NOT ENOUGH- NAILING THE ACTUAL COST AND BEING ABLE TO TELL PEOPLE THAT IT SHOULD BE FAIR AND NOT THROW PEOPLE INTO THE POOR HOUSE OR BANKRUPTCY WHEN THEY ARE TRYING TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES AND THEIR HEALTH >>. LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS. WE ARE NOT SAYING IT SHOULD BE FREE, BUT PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW HOW MUCH THEY WILL HAVE TO PAY BEFORE THEY GET RID OF THESE SERVICES. SO YOU'VE CALLED THIS AND AMERICAN HUMANITARIAN CRISIS. HOW CAN THIS ISSUE BE TACKLED HEAD ON WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE? >>. RIGHT NOW, KUDOS TO THE SENATE. ESTIMATES ARE NOT ENOUGH. IT'S ABOUT MAILING THE ACTUAL COST AND REALLY BEING TRANSPARENT ABOUT IT. WE, AS ARTISTS, ARE CLOSE TO IT BECAUSE WE ARE CONNECTED TO OUR FAMILIES AND WE ARE CONNECTED TO COMMUNITIES WHO DON'T REALLY TRUST GOVERNMENT, DON'T REALLY TRUST THE POLICE OR HOSPITALS OR DOCTORS, AND THAT HAS LEVELED US. SO YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO BE ON THE UP AND UP AND BEING ABLE TO HAVE PEERS LIKE FAT JOE WHOSE GREAT AT EXPLAINING IT LAST NIGHT WITH VALERIE JUNE, AND THEN THE FOO FIGHTERS. THE ARTIST COMMUNITY HAS ACTUALLY PUT LIKE A LARGE BEACON. YOU KNOW A BULLHORN TO THIS, BECAUSE REAL PEOPLE HAVE BEEN IN THE TRENCHES OF TRYING TO FIX THIS AND A BIG UP TO POWER TO THE PATIENTS. WE ARE CONNECTED, WE ARE INVOLVED WITH THIS. YOU KNOW FROM OUR MOMS TO OUR KIDS, TO OUR SPOUSES, THIS IS REAL LIFE >>. I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S REALLY INVOLVED WHEN YOU SAY A BIG CELEBRITY LIKE YOU IS WORKING IN CONJUNCTION WITH AN ORGANIZATION. RARELY IT'S SOMETHING YOU ARE PASSIONATE ABOUT. HAVE YOU HEARD FROM PATIENTS WHAT SORT OF STORIES HAVE YOU HEARD THAT STOOD OUT TO YOU? >>. WHEN SOMEBODY GOES IN AND FINDS OUT THAT MAY NEED A PROCEDURE AND SOMEBODY THAT THEY KNOW IN THE SAME HOSPITAL HAS TO PAY $18,000, THOSE ARE REAL STORIES THAT ARE POPPING UP ALMOST, EVERY DAY AND EVERY MINUTE. SO WE HAVE TO STOP THAT CRIMINALITY. WHEN PEOPLE SAY, LISTEN, I CAN'T AFFORD TO GET FIXED. AT THE END OF THE DAY, THE MORTUARIES HAVE TO HAVE THE CALL AND WE CAN'T HAVE THAT >>. WE, AS A SOCIETY PAY ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, WHEN PEOPLE ARE AFRAID TO GO TO THE DOCTOR, THEY DON'T GET THOSE EARLY TESTS, OR THEY AVOID A HEALTH CRISIS LATER, ON DOWN THE ROAD, WHICH WILL COST A LOT.",[216]
