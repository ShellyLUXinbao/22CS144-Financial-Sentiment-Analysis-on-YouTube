Micheal Baker: Retailers have done a really good job in 2020 to realizing that you've made a mistake and work through it. i really hurt a lot of retailers and try to try to. just about a year ago it was almost pulled off and they got really over sorted. i think the idea here is that margins are going to be better. or is this target basically low balling it, to set expectations low and everyone just says, oh, we know what you're doing, so we're gonna get ahead of that more? i think that our target is giving nice conservative guidance. i think it's the right thing to do at this point. i mean, it's basically been flipping and flopping, and target's been a lot more volatile than wal-mart, and so we'll expect to track that.  bloomberg surveillance with tom keene, lisa abramowicz and jonathan ferro. futures right now up a quarter of one per cent on the s&p 500. we're seeing the beginnings of a regime shift back to a point where interest rates matter. inflation is not a concept that is dead. it may be around the corner. target first, out the gate, bram. i've got to say let's put the stock price action to one side. let's just look at the numbers. the guidance is poor relative to what was expected for the quarter and for the year ahead. now that we have to libyan gravity, the math is back to what it was 16 years ago, just perchance.   i think that eventually, at some point in the future, we will see inflation coming back down to target. i think we're going to be centered around 4 until and, if you know, as if the fed gets above 5 and then you may see some pressure up towards 4 and a half, but we're pretty much in the topping zone.  setting a target of 10 billion management fees is talking. get going through some of the goals of the company. really, the question is going to be about leadership as well as sort of their overall strategic target and what i'm going to do is make this real clear. i think this new regime is here to stay high. it's going to be with us for a while. christopher verrone frankly nailed it here with this: just an absolute soup out there. i'm looking at the goldman sachs powerpoint, john. i'll be honest, it's a lot of managed, happy talk and we got to look beneath tisn't every investor day. i don't really know what to make of it. over the last month, just a massive lift on a two year, three for eighty on a 10 year, ultimately getting closer and closer to 4 percent. i think the markets generally stay in a trading range and the fed stays in a holding pattern, with rate hikes and then a pause until we can get some kind of brake on inflation.  The agreement is aimed at fixing a provision of the brexit treaty that effectively imposed a customs border in the irish sea between great britain and northern ireland.

Central banks are using backward looking information to judge when they've done enough with their forward acting tools of monetary policy. They're not, i don't think, looking too much in inflation.

They know that rate hikes are still going to have a lagged impact. telsey advisory group obviously is under review off the conference call, but a very constructive outperform and he talks about loyalty programs, about the target method, the execution method that they will have.
